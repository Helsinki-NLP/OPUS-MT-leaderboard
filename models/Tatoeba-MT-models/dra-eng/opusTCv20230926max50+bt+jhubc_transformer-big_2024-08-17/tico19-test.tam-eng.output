From 1 January to 15 March 2020, the rapidly escalating incidence of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The gradual onset of the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has ensured that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has a different stage depending on each country, is progressing at a fast pace in all countries by showing a similar trajectory in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness to increase the number of patients who need health care, especially those requiring intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with an unknown causal cause were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a new type of coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Therefore, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named as Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).
As per the available evidence till date, about 80% of the COVID-19 cases in the country are mild to moderate, with or without pneumonia, and most of them have recovered.
In about 14% of the cases, COVID-19 turns into an additional serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% suffer critical illness requiring intensive care.
The case fatality rate for COVID-19 is around 4%
In this study, we assess the trend of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, comparing them with the Hubei Province of China.
We are comparing the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 in Italy.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Following China, COVID-19 spread further geographically and the dynamic situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world now lags behind that of this country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and others recorded Europe's first COVID-19 confirmed cases as per the World Health Organization (WHO) definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were people who returned to France from Wuhan in Hubei province in China on January 24, 2020.
As on 15th March 2020, COVID-19 has been detected in 30 countries and the United Kingdom of the European Union/European Economic Area (EEA) so between 31st December 2019 and 31st December 2019, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported.
Subsequent figures and subsequent events on COVID-19 cases are being obtained.
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official data on reported COVID-19 cases from every country's health ministry, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization are updated daily at 8 a.m.
The data was used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK and compare it with the trend in Italy.
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 cases in the region, we have calculated a 14-day rapid cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and in the UK during the period from 1st January to 15th March 2020.
As on 15th March 2020 at 8 am, we have also provided the cumulative number of cases per country as compared to Italy during 31st January <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 15th March 2020
COVID-19 trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The 14-day rapid cumulative trend of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK (China) has followed the trend in Hubei Province (Figure 1).
The gradual increase in cases of COVID-19 for the entire EU/EEA and the UK started on 21st February and rapidly increased thereafter on 28th February 2020 (Subject).
This was largely achieved by a rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed similar rising trends in subsequent cases of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative combined number of COVID-19 cases available with Italy compared to the EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period 31st January <0xE2><0x80><0x93> 15th March 2020
By 8 a.m. on March 15, by comparison, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already recorded the number of cases in Italy just three weeks earlier or earlier.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Looking at the overall trend of COVID-19 related cases, it appears that the pandemic is progressing at a relatively fast pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages of the national public health response, with different definitions of the disease in different countries, and different procedures including rapid testing to select patients for testing to confirm COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected areas of Italy reported that nearly 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 cases admitted to hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at the EU/EEA level of 6% and 1% each (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement the current surveillance data with a focus on recorded cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study found that Europe has the highest variation in the availability of intensive care and mid-career beds, at 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and mid-care beds per 100,000 people in 2010-11).
In the context of models relating to health care capacity concentration, the sixth update to the COVID-19 Rapid Response Status Assessment (ECDC) for each EU/EEA country and the UK, where COVID-19 cases are estimated to be more than 90% higher than the number of beds in intensive care units, has been issued.
The EU/EEA countries and the UK have so far been clustered in specific regions. Further, as hospitals and intensive care units tend to serve the regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available at the Divisional Nomenclature 2 (Nuts-II) Catalog.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries also show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units must thus prepare themselves for the prolonged community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the ever-increasing number of cases of COVID-19 requiring health care, especially intensive care, which has emerged in the affected regions of Italy.
As mentioned in the latest ECDC Quick Response Risk Assessment, the mitigation approach needs to be changed from containment to proactive and all-inclusive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which, if not implemented in time, will lead to an expected rapid increase in the number of infected people, who understand, accept and adapt to the situation and take adequate decision-making time to respond.
A rapid risk assessment lists public health measures to limit the impact of the pandemic.
There is a small window of opportunity, which countries can use to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce the strain on the health care sector, and further increase containment efforts.
Failing to do so, health care systems in EU/EEA countries could face a massive surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2, has so far killed 3,000 people, infected 80,000 others and wreaked havoc on humans in China and the rest of the world.
Similar to SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in 2003 to infect thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from bats and can cause similar symptoms in the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower incidence and mortality rate than SARS, but it is more transmissible and affects older men and women more frequently than younger men.
Responding to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research subject matter.
Let us look at the basics of epidemiology, pathogenesis, virology, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, prediction and avoidance of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help in understanding and eradicating the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival, which began on January 25, 2020, is an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who have been urged to stay indoors for weeks during and after the holiday season due to the outbreak of the new viral disease.
The characteristics of the virus are similar to that of the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to more than 50 countries around the world.
As on 2nd March 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to spread of the virus has reached 80,000, of which 40,000 patients have been discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 have died.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that COVID-19 is the ""first common enemy"" and that it is far more powerful than terrorism."
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the release of the first report on 7th January 2020, more than 200 studies related to virology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 have been published.
This review seeks to summarize the progress of research on new and rapidly advancing subject matter.
Whenever possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other coronavirus-induced illnesses and Middle East Leprosy Syndrome (the outbreak of 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and epidemiology, and the remaining pressing questions.
Since approximately 15% of four common colds are endemic, coronaviruses have traditionally been thought of as pathogens that do not cause death to humans.
However, in this century, we have faced two highly infectious human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which began to spread in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and spread to other countries, causing deadly morbidity and mortality.
COVID-19 is the third pandemic in the history of mankind.
The National Health Commission of China was first informed on December 31, 2019 from Wuhan about the outbreak affecting unknown pneumonia populations, as shown in Figure 1.1.
Seven days later, the sequence of COVID was released.
The first death in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Since then, the virus has spread to nearby towns and cities.
On January 20, there was a report of infection among health care providers, which revealed the possibility of human-to-human transmission.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down and all public transport was shut down.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease reported that of the 41 patients who tested positive, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site where the infection originated from an unvaccinated animal.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency.
By the time the report was released, the disease had already spread to more than 50 countries in China and around the world (Figure 2).
As the environment is rapidly changing, the final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
A multi-center study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 cases, conducted on 11th February, 2020 has given the following new information about the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX<0x5F>rHPXa1qHA2bhdA)
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but the primary victims are people in the age group of 30-65 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected individuals are above 50 years of age, very few are below 20 years of age, and only 14 of the infected individuals are below 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more males (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly in Hubei and its surrounding areas.
Since the onset of COVID-19, it has taken an average of 5 (2-9) days to detect the disease.
The average incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8 - 13 days).
The basic reproductive number (R.0) was 3.77 (95% C.I.: 3.51-4.05) and the modified R.0 is 2.23-4.82.
In line with the large-scale transportation prior to the Spring Festival in China, the number of cases before January 23, 2020, spread rapidly.
The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) among confirmed cases is 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10<0xE2><0x80><0x93>1.86%) and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of all cases is 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02<0xE2><0x80><0x93>4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men), age (60 and older) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses belong to the subfamily of large and enveloped pathogens with single strands of the sense ribosome (RNA-RNA).
They can be divided into four species: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, in which alpha- and beta-CoV are known to infect humans.
Envelopes spike(S) glycoprotein binds to its cell receptors angiotensin-convertible enzyme 2 (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptides 4 (DPP4) to bind to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then to MERS-CoV.
In the virus, RNA-RNA genomes are released into the nucleus; after the virus genome is replicated, the genetic ribosome (RNA-RNA) with the enveloped glycoprotein and protein-containing microorganism (MRV) is released into the nucleus.
The first genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 was recorded on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2, a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity, was detected between 10 sequenced samples collected at the Wuhan seafood market in Wuhan, the original site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically identical to SARS-CoV rather than MERS-CoV, which is the same as SARS-CoV.
Through the Dispatch Electron Microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the sputum over human airway epithelium.
It has been found to be a receptor for both human ACE2, SARS-KV-2 and SARS-KV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection among patients than SARS-CoV.
With SARS-CoV-2, a modern small protein coded by ORF3.B can also be produced and a secreted protein coded by ORF8.
The ORFB of SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFN beta; however, ORF8 has no known functional mass or field of view.
On 18th February 2020, Jove and others registered a low-temperature electronic microscope configuration of a full-length human ACE2 with an amino acid transducer P0AT1.
The opening and closing contour linkages were integrated into the cylindrical chain and the ACE-2-B0AT1 linkage would combine two S proteins that could be the source of the virus and the source of the infection.
B0AT1 may be the target for drug monitoring to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Start-up and intermediate
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both originated in bats and spread to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
By evolutionary comparison of other SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV-2, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2(SARS-CoV-2) initially lived in bats, since SARS-CoV21 (SARS-CoV-2) is a type of SARS-CoVS-like SARS-CoVS-XV2.
However, it is not yet known what is the causative agent of the virus in humans beyond the ethnic barrier, and the way it spreads is not clear.
Xi and others proposed that the virus may have been transmitted from bats to humans through snakes due to a similar recombination of their S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that the most widely used, long-spotted ant-eater mammal species in Chinese traditional medicine, the ant-eater ant-eater ant-eater, may be carrying SARS-CoV2.
However, the 1% difference that is spread across the two genomes is still a big difference, so we are still waiting for reliable results for conclusive evidence (Fig. 33).
The biochemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 48 hours in an externally dry environment, 20 <0xC2><0xB0>C and 40-50% humidity for up to 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics to SARS-CoV-2.
Information has been recorded that SARS-CoV-2 is diluted by ultraviolet and at 56 <0xC2><0xB0>C for 30 minutes; 75% of ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fats disinfectants can neutralize the virus, but chlorhexie does not.
The entire human population is immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the novel virus.
At present, there is no detailed study on the safety effects of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only correct previous studies about other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. 4).
Generally, when a virus infects an infected person, it is first identified by the infected person's immune system through visible identification receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (DLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-like receptors (RLRs).
The virus triggers the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of the cervix cells, the synthesis of the first type of immune protein (IFNs) in different ways that limit the spread of the virus and increase the rate at which the virus is absorbed and destroyed in the blood glucose of viral antibodies.
However, my protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the mutated immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4<0x2B> and CD8<0x2B> cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4<0x2B> T cells stimulate B-cells to produce antibodies against that particular virus, and CD8<0x2B> T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
In order to help the defensive cells, the T helper cells produce the pro - inflammatory cytonol.
However, the CoV may induce the thymus to die off on its own and inhibit the activity of thymosomes.
Immunity and antibodies, including by-products such as C3A and C5A, are required to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies obtained from recovered patients made MERS-KV inactivated.
On the other hand, the immune system will release a large number of inactive molecules in the area due to overactivity, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and various organs can also cause death in the worst-case scenario.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely to affect the elderly and pregnant women with co-morbidities, due to the primary components of its group.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of pathogens, or who have been vaccinated, to be more susceptible to infection than others.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the incubation period is estimated to be 1-14 days, mostly of 3-7 days, based on a study of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, in a study of 1,099 infected people, it was reported that the average incubation period was 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
In a more recent study, based on the population of 8,866 cases described above, the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The most important task for health authorities is to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the incubation period, so that infected but asymptomatic people can avoid spreading the virus to others.
As a general practice, infected or infected individuals are usually required to isolate for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The major and early symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with or without symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
A week after infection, some patients experienced shortness of breath and/or blood clots.
In severe cases, patients develop hypersensitivity syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, hypoglycemia, and haemorrhage.
Patients with symptoms of fever and/or respiratory failure and severe fever should be tested during early diagnosis, even if they do not have pulmonary disorders.
A population study conducted in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath, 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family group and a group of asymptomatic individuals.
By comparison, a 2012 population study found that the primary symptoms of MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, just as MERS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19, 80% of them require supplemental ventilation support than COVID-19 patients.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also diagnosed in MERS patients.
The main symptoms of SARS are fever (99%-100), dry cough (29%<0xE2><0x80><0x93>75%), shortness of breath (40%<0xE2><0x80><0x93>42%), diarrhea (20<0xE2><0x80><0x93>25%), and sore throat (13<0xE2><0x80><0x93>25%) and ventilation (approximately 14%<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20%).
By 14th February, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 was 2% as against 66,576 cases globally.
By comparison, SARS had a fatality rate of 10% of the 8,096 infected people by November 2002.
For Mers, based on a population survey conducted in June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was in the range of 2 to 4.
Comparisons of symptoms, mortality and R0 between SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV are shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but causes fewer deaths than the other two.
Thus, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is even more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Periodic outbreaks occur in the same family or in the same meeting or in vehicles such as luxury ships.
Most of the cases were people who had traveled to or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas, or had contact with individuals or patients who had been infected two weeks before the outbreak began.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and patients who have recovered and been discharged may be able to carry the virus again, sending a warning signal to increase the time for isolation.
In the early stages, patients have normal or low numbers of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes).
For example, in 1,099 patients infected with COVID-19, deficiency with a white blood cell count of less than 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L and high aspartate aminotransferase levels and hypersensitivity to blood were detected, including the drainage cell count of less than 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L.
For some patients, the level of liver and flesh enzymes and muscular dystrophy in the blood increased, and for most patients, the C-reactive protein in the blood and the red blood cell count also increased.
In patients with severe cases, D2 was high in the blood clotting factor, and the number of drainage was very low.
Among most COVID-19 patients, abnormalities have been detected in breast radiographs and the lungs have opacity, such as double-sided patches or stained glass.
Patients often have non-typical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive filament proliferation actively compromise gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type one and type two pneumocytes reduces the amplitude level and increases the amplitude, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and maximizing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the findings of the worst breast radiation show the most serious nature of the disease from time to time.
On 18 February 2020, in the first epidemiological analysis of COVID-19, the sepsis of pneumocytes, formation of exudate and infiltration of tissue transurethral drainage. Also, multiple intramuscular cells in the lungs of the deceased patient, as in SARS and MERS patients, were found to be infected with the viral infection and ARTs.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribosomes (RNA-RNA) through recombinant transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as an important command line tool for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, hospital exposures in China on 13 February 2020 used diagnostic methods (without relying solely on RT-PCR) because of the false-negative rate, which could exacerbate the epidemic.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
However, information on pre-existing diseases, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings are essential and mandatory for proper diagnosis.
On 14th February 2020, the Feng Shang team used CRISPR-based technology to detect SARS-CoV-2 using a process called Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 sequencing at 10 <0xC3><0x97> 18 <0xCE><0xBC>L per 10 <0xCE><0xBC>L/L/L for 10 <0xCE><0xBC>L/L/L of RNA at the level of 18 to 18 <0xCE><0xBC>L.
If confirmed in clinical samples, the new technology is believed to be able to dramatically improve sensitization and comfort.
In the absence of adequate experience with novel CoV, doctors are primarily providing support care to COVID-19 patients, while seeking out different types of treatments that have been previously used or proposed to treat other CoVs and MERS-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. (Section 2)
Antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicines and psychosocial support are currently available and effective treatments.
It was also suggested that plasma from recovered patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are rapidly competing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the initial stage, and can also attack other organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, that release ACE2.
However, respiratory failure or inability to breathe is a major threat and the leading cause of death for patients.
Thus, respiratory support is crucial to relieve symptoms and save lives, which, depending on the severity of the disease, may include general oxygen therapy, high flow of oxygen, transverse ventilation and transverse mechanical ventilation.
Patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome should be supported by ECMO, a modified renal transplantation technique used to treat at risk of death from heart attack or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and viral shock and preservation of vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The cytokine spiral is known to be the result of the over-functioning of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of blockable inflammatory tulangal that releases an array of cytokines including DNF alpha, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IFN alpha, IFN beta, IFN gamma and MCP-1.
These activators stimulate the immune cells to release large amounts of inactive molecules, the main cause of the breakdown of ARDS and various organs.
Immunotherapy is essential for the treatment of cytokine stroms, especially in severe patients.
Tocilizumab, an anti-cellulite antibody to pronitrogen and IL6, has been used to treat cytokine storm.
Modification of T-cell-activated immune response; prevention of IFN-gamma, IL-1 and TNF; JAK suppression, plinthdomop; suppression of cytokine signal 4; and suppression of HTAC inhibition are other pathogens of cytokine storm.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not effective in severe lung injury among patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially bone tissue destruction without blood flow, which can greatly affect prognosis.
However, for life-threatening COVID-19 patients, it is recommended to administer prothrombin in the short term, at least in the medium term.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous intravenous administration of Remdesivir, the basic remdesivir, has been found to have the desired effect on a US patient who had COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new type of antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remdesivir also, along with other single-stranded RNA (RNA - RNA) including MERS and SARS pathogens, demonstrated antiviral capabilities.
Based on these, Gilead has provided a joint material to China for testing of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, Parisitinpi, interveran-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as standard treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may result in diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other unwanted effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and Antigens from Recovered Patients.
The practice of collecting the blood of patients who have recovered from an infectious disease and treating other patients with the same disease or who are otherwise healthy has a long history of protecting individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, recovered patients have higher levels of antibodies compared to the pathogens in their blood.
Antibodies are the immune protein (IG) produced by B- lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign organisms. They identify and directly inactivate the unique molecules in the pathogens.
Based on this, plasma of blood collected from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 infection was administered to 10 patients who were in a critical condition.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours and the inflammatory and viral load was reduced and the oxygen saturation level in the blood improved.
However, since no specific treatment has been developed yet, confirmation and clarification are needed before this method can be proposed on a large scale.
In addition, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should also be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies may overstimulate the immune response to produce a symptom called cytokine, which can be life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and plasma is needed to treat life-threatening patients.
It is difficult to develop and manufacture enough specific antibodies to rapidly fight an international pandemic.
Thus, extracting B-cells from recovered patients, detecting the genetic codes of the effective antibody or detecting beneficial antibodies against the essential proteins of the virus is more necessary and practical.
In this way, we can immediately increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used for thousands of years to treat various diseases in China.
However, the results will depend on the combination of various components of a formula, which will vary depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the principles of TCM.
Most of the effective components are either unknown or obscure, as such components or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and confirm.
Currently, since there is no specific and effective treatment for COVID-19, TCM is the main alternative treatment for patients with moderate to moderate symptoms or those recovering from serious conditions.
For example, Shu Feng Jee Tu Capsules and Lian Hua Shing Wen Capsules have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
Several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hanan (50%), where DCM was used over 87% of COVID-19 patients, have reported high recovery rates. At the same time, Hubei province saw the lowest recovery rate (13%) for DCM to be used on COVID-19 patients approximately 30% more often
However, this is a more accurate comparison as many other influencing factors, such as the number and severity of patients, need to be factored into the assessment.
On 18th February 2020, Fake Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western Medicine (WM) alone and the combined treatment of DCM with WM.
They found that the time required for thermal recovery, as well as for hospitalisation, was less than for traditional Chinese medicine compared to Western medicine.
Quite mind-bogglingly, the rate of symptom worsening (intensification from mild) is significantly lower in the WM<0x2B>DCM group than in just the WM group (46.2% versus 7.4%). Furthermore, the mortality rate is lower than in the WM<0x2B>DCM group (3.8% versus just WM group)
However, to know about the efficacy and safety of DCM has to wait for the conduct of studies at larger scale and more centres in well controlled environments.
It is tempting to outline the mechanisms of action and explain the beneficial components of TCM treatments or, if possible, their compounds.
Patients who have been confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 often experience great fear of diseases that can lead to over-infection or even death, and isolated people experience fatigue, isolation and anger.
Further, adverse effects such as fever, lack of oxygen, symptoms of infection such as cough, and lack of sleep due to the use of corticosteroids during treatment can cause additional distress and distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, there were reports of a wide range of mental health effects, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic, psychosis, psychosis, paranoia, and suicidal ideation.
Compulsory contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health measures in response to the spread of COVID-19 may further make people feel anxious and guilty about the effects of the pandemic, the isolation and the stigma attached to it against their family and friends.
Thus, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected cases, and people in contact with them, as well as the general public in need.
Psychological support should include the use of professional electronic tools and apps to avoid close contact with one another, along with clear interactions and treatment plans with different departments and mental health teams, and continuous and accurate updates on SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Effective vaccines are needed to halt the chain of animal and human-to-human transmission of infection, and antiviral treatment to control infection from emerging pathogens.
Efforts are being made to develop long-acting and inactivated anti-S protein-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The vaccine has been evaluated on animal models that have been directly dosed to SARS.
However, the efficacy and safety of the vaccine on the elderly and on dying samples is yet to be determined before the clinical trial commences.
This is because SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and since then there has been no new outbreak of the disease.
In contrast, MERS continues to occur in Angkor and in groups in the Middle East, and spread to other areas due to the presence of animals in endemic areas.
Vaccine strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated pathogens, DNA plasmids, ultrafine surfaces, nanoparticles, particles such as pathogens, and recombinant protein subunits, some of which have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulty due to the long time required to develop the vaccine (an average of 18 months) and the dynamic variants of the CoV.
As a brand new disease, COVID-19 has just begun its full clinical journey with thousands of patients.
In the majority of cases, patients can recover without any side effects.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease predictive model is necessary for health care agencies, especially in resource-poor areas, to determine the priority of their services.
Based on the clinical studies recorded so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting the recovery of SARS, and the same is true of COVID-19.
As explained above, in a study of 8,866 active cases, COVID-19 primarily affects 47.7% of those aged 50 to 65.
Patients requiring intensive care already had both diseases and complications, and were significantly older than those who did not require such treatment (51 as against the median age of 66), suggesting that age was a factor in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000).
Two diseases and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care may suffer from acute heart failure and hemorrhagic undernourishment.
Heart attacks are the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to ace2-positive cholangiocyts and can cause liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that there is a strong link between age and chronic diseases and they can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects tissue damage or severity in tissue epithelial, and is proposed as pre-diagnostic factors for disease, treatment response, and eventual recovery.
The link between CRP levels and prediction of severity and recovery from COVID-19 is proposed.
In addition, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LHT), aspartate amino transducer (ASD), alanine amino transducer (ALD) and creatinine kinase (CK) can help predict results.
These enzymes are overexpressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissues are damaged.
Thus, they are traditional markers for heart or liver disorders.
Important clinical symptoms: The temporary improvement of breast radiotherapy and clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues of prediction of the effects and complications of COVID-19.
Use of Steroids: As described above, steroids are an immunosuppressant commonly used as an adjuvant therapy to reduce the severity of damage caused by inflammation during infectious diseases.
Since the widespread use of high doses of pronitrogenium on severe SARS patients, many people who have recovered from the disease have suffered from life-long disability and poor quality of life with bloodless bone tissue destruction.
Thus, if necessary, short-term steroids should be used for short-term treatment of COVID-19 patients.
Mental distress: As described above, many of the patients during the COVID-19 outbreak are suffering from abnormal distress due to long-term isolation and extreme instability and seeing the death of close family members and co-patients.
It is imperative to provide psychological counseling and long-term support for these patients to recover from depression and return to normal life.
Demographic studies to date have shown that the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is different than that of SARS.
In addition to multiplying in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also efficiently multiplys in the upper respiratory tract and, like other cold-causing coronaviruses in the early stages of infection, multiplys in the body with little or no symptoms.
Therefore, infected patients may produce high levels of the virus during daily activities, either in the early stages or in the early stages of symptoms, making it very difficult to control the spread of the pandemic.
However, while most transmission did not occur at an early stage, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to occur when patients were seriously ill.
Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is more serious and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
With the hope of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, special efforts have been made, including lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities and isolation of almost the entire population.
While these activities are causing serious damage to the country's economy and other sectors, the number of new patients is declining, indicating that the epidemic is limited.
The most optimistic estimate is that the pandemic will end in March and the decline period will last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so convinced.
Paul Hunter and others predicted that COVID-19, which is more transmissible than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Ira Longini et al. established a model to predict the effects of the pandemic and suggested that two-thirds of the world's population could be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the middle ribs and throat swabs of patients who recovered from the disease and left the hospital two weeks earlier. This indicates that the newly discovered virus can occur in the same manner as the flu.
However, given the declining number of new cases, there are promising signs in China, indicating that current strategies are bearing fruit.
It was initially predicted that one million people would be affected by Ebola and half a million would die.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has the potential to decrease its ability to attack and become progressively extinct, or to become a highly communicable virus that can coexist with humans.
The following is a comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing and sneezing, and there is a possibility of transmission through direct contact with infected material.
The virus has also been found in feces, resulting in new possibilities of transmission from feces through the mouth.
A recent study of 138 infected people found that 41% of those infected were likely to have contracted the virus through hospitalisation, including 17 patients with pre-existing diseases and 40 health care providers.
Thus, special arrangements should be made to protect human beings, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those standing by the side of patients and infected people.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face shields and use both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Serial <0x23> 1860S) to help contain the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask avoids liquid droplets in an environment where pathogens, which can travel through the air from an infected person or stick to the surface of objects, can be transmitted from there to others.
However, only the N95 (order <0x23> 1860S) masks provide protection against inhalation of small mature pathogens of 10 to 80 mm, of which only 5% mature pathogens can penetrate fully; SARS-CoV-2 is the same as SARS-CoV, both of which are approximately 85 nm in size.
As the particles will penetrate five surgical masks stacked together, health care providers in direct contact with patients will be required to wear N-95 (series <0x23> 1860S) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers must wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted through the eyes of an individual.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflammatory eyes.
Thus, health care providers must also wear opaque masks or protective glasses when working with patients.
It is highly recommended that all the general public in affected or likely to be affected areas wash their hands more frequently than usual with disinfectant soap, try to stay indoors by self-quarantine and maintain minimal contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered a safe distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective in reducing the risk of infection and at the same time preventing the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has come into the world as a new virus in humans, its superstructure unity with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, should have created a high alert in China, based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, as of January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control was comforting citizens by saying that the new virus is less contagious and spreads from human to human, and that avoiding and controlling the disease is not a problem.
This information eased the alarm among the public, especially as the entire country was preparing for the spring festival, and the critical time to control the disease to a very limited extent in Wuhan was missed.
"The disease control agencies in China can take these difficult lessons and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements, as each word may be taken into account by citizens and change their attitudes and decisions; (2) act with extra sensitivity and diligence to provide extraordinary information from hospitals without waiting for formal reports from doctors or authorities; (3) enhance the organization of the epidemic, without trying to comfort the general public, and (4) try to prevent the outbreak of the epidemic with greater control over the community at an early stage.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread all over China and to nearly 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to SARS-CoV again, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of re-emergence of SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for controlling the spread of the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger individuals, as well as men more than women, and has a higher incidence and mortality rate among older people than younger individuals.
The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
While COVID-19 patients, despite asymptomatic, spread the virus, SARS patients will only spread the virus if they are seriously ill, which is why it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA-RNA tests for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in some COVID-19 patients show negative results.
On the other hand, patients who have recovered can be tested again for the viral infection.
These changes can significantly increase the risk of infection.
Despite such rapid advances in research on COVID-19, several key issues remain unresolved, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic consensus has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like two bat coronaviruses, we are still unable to confirm that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What was the intermediate species responsible for the spread of the virus from bats to humans?
Without the answers to <0x23>1 and 2, we can't effectively disconnect the spread. And the spread can always be restarted.
Molecular models and biochemical assessments have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2. But how does the virus enter the airways and cause the subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus bind to cells that release ACE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus mutate when it is transmitted between humans?
Will it be a global pandemic, like SARS, or will it be seasonal, like the flu?
This is necessary, but requires a little more time to search for answers to the above and many more questions.
Whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the spread of this pandemic as quickly as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Avian influenza virus (HCoV)
For thousands of years, genetic mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of CoVs (coronaviruses) and their host organisms, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two HCoVs, known as human coronaviruses, were known to cause mild disease such as the common cold.
The severe outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has revealed how deadly and life-threatening the human coronavirus infection is.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 brought attention back to CoVs and surprised us with its high transmissibility but low morbidity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The HCoV infection is of animal origin and it is useful for us to understand the zoonotic origin of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, but they do not cause disease.
The intermediate reservoir of some HCoVs is also known.
Identification of animal hosts has direct implications in the prevention of diseases in humans.
The study of CoV-zoom interactions in animals may provide important insight into CoV pathogenesis in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of their discovery and their zoonotic origins and inter-species transmission.
Importantly, we are comparing different HCoVs (HCoV) from the perspective of virus evolution and genomic replication.
The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being discussed at this moment.
In addition, requirements for successful amphibious transitions and the impacts of viral evolution on disease severity are indicated.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of frozen, positive-energy, single-stranded RNA pathogens.
The pathogens, which have a large genome with 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses, were called "coronaviruses" due to their crown-like appearance, which is visible when viewed under an electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented lineages that share a similar structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome consists of two large, overlapping overlaying open reading frames (ORF1a, and ORF1b) that are converted into 'replicas', PP1A and PP1AB.
These polymorphisms, referred to as NSP 1-16, are further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including pin (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
The unique sub-proteins of each gene are encoded by different inherited coronaviruses.
Based on the protein sequence difference, coronaviruses are classified into four (alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus, and delta-coronavirus), most of which are in the beta-coronavirus types, and are divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence shows that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source of most alpha-coronaviruses and beta-coronaviruses, while birds are the main source of gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continued to cross ethnic barriers and, some of them, have evolved into important human pathogens.
To date, seven types of human coronaviruses have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-coronaviruses.
Other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV-2), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E (HCoV-229E), HCoV-OC43 (HCoV-OC43), HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 commonly cause mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly identified non-SARS-CoV-2 are more pathogenic, resulting in more severe lower respiratory tract infections, which are relatively more severe than acute respiratory tract infections (ARDS).
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal discharges of people with colds in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected about HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 through extensive studies, both of which cause self-control symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was generally accepted that infections caused by human coronaviruses were harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people and claiming the lives of about 10% of the population.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a series of epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula, and it spread widely to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which is rechristened as SARS-CoV-2, is the agency for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world must prepare for the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
There are seven types of HCoVs that originate in animals, either from bats, rats or domestic animals.
Various evidence supports the evolution of all HCoVs from bats, showing that the pathogens are well adapted and disease-free but with large genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
The discovery of the zoonotic origin of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding natural history, driving force, and factors that control the spread between species.
It may also guide or facilitate the search for stagnant, intermediate and multiplying animal host(s) of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications in preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the animal-borne origins of human coronaviruses, inter-species transmission, and pathogen formation.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent pathogens of HCoVs are generally pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic in new hosts after inter-species transmission.
We also review the trend of the evolution of the HCoV, in which the morbidity is reduced as the transmission increases.
The effects of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are discussed in this context.
The presence of animal coronaviruses has been known since the late 1930s.
Different CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog, before the strain B814 of HCoV-229E was isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients suffering from common cold.
In the last decade, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of the HCoV chronologically (Table 1) will be illustrative and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of upper respiratory tract infections in 1966, and later adapted to grow in the pulmonary cell lines of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have typical cold symptoms such as headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10<0x7E>20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43, was extracted from organ culture as well as existing pathways in the brains of mice.
The infectious clinical features of HCoV-OC43 are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which are indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses in terms of symptoms from infection.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are transmitted during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, in these two viruses, the incubation period is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed moderate to normal mucus.
Severe lower respiratory tract infection was seen in only a few immunocompromised patients.
SARS, also known as "Natural Pneumonia," was the first well-documented HCoV-infection and SARS-CoV disease causative agent in human history, making it the third HCoV discovery.
The first case of SARS was detected in late 2002 in Guangdong province of China.
There have been 8,096 reported cases of SARS with 774 deaths, and it has spread to many countries and continents.
With the exception of super-spreaders, it is estimated that each infection can lead to approximately two secondary infections, with a gap of 4 to 7 days between the onset of symptoms and the peak of the virus appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially have muscular dystrophy, headache, fever, malaise and chills followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress are early symptoms.
Lymphopenia, dysfunctional liver function tests, and high levels of creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
A wide range of respiratory chambers damage, epithelial cells proliferation and increase in macrophages have been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and artificial respiration.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can also be affected in these severe infections, usually accompanied by a cytokine cycle, which can be particularly dangerous for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of a patient from an index hospital who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been dedicated to human coronavirus research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients suffering from respiratory diseases.
In the case of HCoV-NL63, it is common to develop goryssa, flu, and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described extracting the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it is found in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63, and its peak events occur in summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive larynx inflammation, also known as the spinal cord.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was extracted from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is thought to be associated with an increase in severe asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected worldwide, causing mild respiratory illnesses.
These four community-acquired HCoVs are highly adaptable to humans, and are generally less likely to cause serious infectious diseases, although accidents occur for unknown reasons, as in the rare case of the more serious subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently declared a severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
Generally, these HCoVs become less severe or pathogenic as they gain the ability to spread effectively and continue to keep themselves within humans.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most of the lab-confirmed cases have originated in the Middle East, cases with secondary transmission caused by close contact from time to time have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients infected with MERS also had severe renal failure, which is unique so far only to MERS in HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, confirmed cases in more than 2,500 laboratories have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of known pneumonia cases associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 as an international related public health emergency, and has named the disease COVID-19.
As on 3rd March 2020, there are 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with 3.4% of active cases.
Notably, there have been 4.2% deaths in Hubei, China, whereas there are only 1.2% deaths outside it.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory infections with fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing, which can lead to respiratory problems.
Fever is seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms, and it can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to 82% high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 has a lower incidence of infection compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but is more transmissible.
There have been reports of patients being infected without showing symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is likely to be responsible for the rapid spread of the disease around the world.
Comparing SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals similarities and differences between them.
First, the duration of symptoms and the duration of the HCoV disease are similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the common course of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, on the other hand, brings out features commonly seen during infection with community-transmitted HCoVs (HCoV), including those that are not significantly absent, moderate, or without any symptoms.
On the other hand, a small fraction of those who have been severely affected by COVID-19 have also been found to be infected with SARS-CoV, although its rate is slightly lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 shows characteristics of interesting patterns of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was less than that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it needs to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans is reduced in a phased manner, like in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as does SARS-CoV-2, is to be clarified by future studies, at least in certain circumstances.
It is very interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 will manifest itself in the same way as the cases of community-transmitted HCoVs.
Nevertheless, aspects of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmission, pathogenesis, and constant transmission after it has passed into the body of humans, will continue to influence the final fate of the now-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
All four of the community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms are well-suited to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have learned to live well with these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both may have been survivors of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and those who have developed severe HCoVs have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must be replicated sufficiently in humans to allow for accumulation of adaptive genetic mutations that are resistant to host control factors.
In this way, when the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts longer and infects more people, there is a greater chance of becoming one that is fully compatible with humans.
If this changes itself to the situation, it will be difficult to stop the spread to humans by extraction or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-acquired coronaviruses have spread to the human population, triggering a common cold in humans who are not immune.
These animals do not need antibiotics.
In contrast, high-throughput pathogens such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans, and therefore cannot extend their transmission within humans.
They need to survive and thrive in their animal way of shacks and get a chance to move to easily vulnerable human targets, perhaps even walk through one or more intermediate and multiplier hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/Mers-CoV and the four HCoVs present in the community.
In the current scenario, it is at least as transmissible as community-linked HCoVs.
However, it is less contagious than community-acquired HCoVs and less contagious than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it can be fully adapted to humans and spread to humans without spooling or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the origins of human coronaviruses in animals, it would be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolution of human coronaviruses, nature, intermediateity, and proliferation of hosts.
If an animal has a closely related ancestor that shares a high affinity at the level of the nucleotide sequence, it acts as the evolutionary host of an HCoV.
This ancestral virus usually adapts itself to the host and is not a pathogen in the host.
Likewise, the stagnant hosts continue to retain the HCoV continuously and for a long period of time.
In both cases, the opossums are naturally infected and are natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCOV is introduced into or around a new intermediate host before it is introduced to humans, it will not fit well with the new host and often it will cause disease.
This intermediate host can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and can play the role of the multiplying host by allowing the virus to replicate intermittently, and then pass it on to humans to multiply the human infection.
If an HCoV is unable to sustain its spread in an intermediate host, it will subject itself to end-stage infection.
On the contrary, HCoVs can replace the intermediate host and can also produce a long-term pathogen infection.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data has revealed that SARS's first known infection has a history of contact with game animals.
A subsequent epidemiological study indicated that animal traders had higher levels of SARS-CoV immune protein compared to the general population.
In live animal markets, mascud palm civets (Bakuma larvata) and the raccoon dog were first known to carry viruses such as SARS-CoV, which are similar to SARS-CoV.
It is no secret that no further SARS infection has been reported after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civet cats from the forest or farms without contact with live animal markets are often negative for SARS-CoV. These masked palm civet cats may only act as an intermediate multiplier host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS
In particular, it cannot be denied that many types of small mammals may also have acted as intermediate multiplier hosts of the SARS-CoV as various animals in the markets in Guangzhou contain 80% SARS-CoV antibodies.
All of these appear to be the end-stage host of the SARS-CoV
The search for the natural animal host of the SARS coronavirus revealed a closely related bat coronavirus called SARS-R-RH-Wauw virus HKU3 (SARS-RH-Wauw virus HKU3) in Chinese rhinoceros bats.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV anti-antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
It and other bat coronaviruses, together with SARS-CoV, have 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the only ones that carry emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs, such as SARS-CoV, have also been identified from bats, but nothing other than a distinct WIV1 can be extracted as a living virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1, derived from a fecal sample of bats, was demonstrated to be able to use bat, civet, and human ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, the lymphocytes of infected SARS patients are capable of neutralizing WIV1.
So far, WIV1 refers to the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleic acid sequence similarity.
Despite the high similarity between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV.
MERS-CoV belongs to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
The bat coronavirus HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor dipeptide peptide peptides 4 (DPP4) for viral entry.
Among the bat beta-coronaviruses identified from Europe and Africa, MERS-CoV's ribosome (RNA-RNA) is closely related to RNA-dependent ribosome (RNA-RNA) polymerase sequences.
So far, no MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative, the bat coronavirus HKU25, share only 87% nucleic acid sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not be an immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels are as transmissible to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing immune substances as camels of Middle Eastern origin in several African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, has been isolated from the nasal cavity of camels in a monotypic manner, indicating that the camels act as the actual reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV, there are generally mild to moderate symptoms but large outbreaks of the virus.
Infected camels shed the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is the main way the virus is shed in bats.
However, since many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the appearance of the symptom, it is said to be an unknown mode of transmission involving human-to-human transmission or unapproved animal species that have MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleic acid affinity with bat coronavirus RADG13, extracted from rhinoceros aphinis bats.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequencing difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is great enough to create a parental relationship.
This means that unless there are virtually identical bat coronaviruses in the future, bats will not be able to be instant reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among the wildlife species sold and killed in Huan's seafood wholesale market, with many of the early events of COVID-19 associated with it, which is an animal-human transmission phenomenon.
Several recent studies, based on alternative genomic sequencing, have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis Javanica) may also possess the ancestral beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The novel anteater coronavirus genomes share 85-92% nucleic acid sequence sequencing with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely related to RADG13 with about 90% identity in terms of nucleic acid sequence.
They join two sub-genera of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the genus tree, one of which shares a very similar receptor binding domain (RPD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In contrast, the RBD gents of SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 are very different, although they are genetically similar.
An earlier study on sick anteaters reported that viral contiguous lesions were detected from lung samples, which were associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The study followed different combination methods and genome determination to form a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length pathogen genome.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the direct anteater origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequencing difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the anteater SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RADG13 is shorter than the distance between the beta-CoV viruses associated with SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 is to be established in bats, pangolins and other mammals.
The highest sequence similarity in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins has been found, with beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2, and RAG13 sharing the highest genome sequencing.
It is a great assumption that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2-related strains of the Ant Tinni's SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selective mediated convergent evolution.
A third wild animal species has a counter-project for a recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13.
As a driving force in evolution, there is widespread occurrence of recombination among beta-coronaviruses.
The jury is not yet included in the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly aggressive HCoV-229E, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been studied.
Genetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated in bat coronaviruses, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HHKU1 have also been detected in animals.
A bat CoV called Appalachian Ridge CoV.2, detected in the North American Terrestrial bat, has been reported to show close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus known as Hippocyteros/Ganaquam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camels are suspected to be its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current status of the zoonotic origins of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Genetic analysis has provided evidence of inter-species transmission of HCoVs in history.
A pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded in 1890 when it crossed HCoV-OC43 strains to infect humans from domestic livestock.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
New strains of bat-alpha-coronavirus, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been discovered.
Among them is the alpha-coronavirus.
There is evidence that the virus spreads directly from bats to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, can communicate with bats in a shared environment.
Humans, on the other hand, are closely related to monkeys.
Second, bat-alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are different in bats and less contagious, whereas aphrodisiac-alpha-coronavirus causes respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, the aphrodisiac alpha-coronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of humans acquiring HCoV-229E-related alpha-coronavirus cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
So it’s not too surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, bat alpha-CoVs may act as the genetic banks of HCoV-229E, while alphas and dromedary camels may act as intermediate hosts to transmit the viruses to humans, similar to MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of transmission from bats to single-thing camels and from solitary-thing camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats has been known since it was first identified, and has been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
It is obvious that bats act as a convenient storage bank for viral species for gene separation and animal transmission transmission.
Long life, dense groups, close social contact, and strong ability to fly are favorable conditions for bats to be an excellent 'viral spreader'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to monogamous camels for decades.
This virus has adapted well in camels and has converted camels from an intermediate host to a stable and natural stagnation host.
MERS-CoV causes disease on a very moderate scale and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its scattered spread on humans is an accident. humans are the ultimate host of MERS-CoV as their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to camels' role in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolins beta-coronaviruses are highly contagious in pangolins.
As in the case of SARS-CoV, cats may be the ultimate host for beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The possibility of human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be proven or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats may be a reservoir host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through butchery or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be one of the newly introduced intermediate multiplying host of SARS-CoV-2-related pathogens.
Humans get the virus by consuming the meat of butchers and hunting animals.
Several mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Analysis of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is required.
Third, as noted above, the recombination and compatibility of SARS-CoV-2 may have developed in a third species that is associated with bats and pangolins.
The search for the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three major factors on the part of pathogens are helping CoVs to overcome the strains.
First, the relatively high mutation rates in their ribosome (RNA - RNA) replication.
Compared to other single-isolated RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoVs can be considered “moderate to “high”, with an average replacement rate of approximately 4 out of 10 per year for the site, which may vary for novel hosts depending on the stage of CoV.
Coronaviruses contain the error-seeking exoribonuclease, which results in a very high degree of genetic mutation and deterioration or inactivation.
Interestingly, intravenous acid analog remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication by inhibiting the exorbable and RNA-dependent ribosome (RNA-RNA-RNA) polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs to be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the genetic mutation rates of CoVs are a million times higher than that of their host species.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often higher when HCoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is obviously lower, indicating a higher degree of adaptation in humans.
Intuitively, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition, this applies not only to SARS-CoV-2, but also to MERS-CoV, which is adapted to monotypic camels.
Theoretically, the gene against SARS-CoV-2 could make vaccines and antiviral vaccines ineffective.
Secondly, the large RNA in CoVs exerts additional plasticity in gene mutation for mutation and rearrangement, thereby increasing the probability for co-evolution of the gaps, which is favorable for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate
It is supported by numerous unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2> end of the gene.
Thirdly, CoVs change randomly and frequently preform during RNA (RNA - RNA) replication through a unique “copy-selection technique.
In a host that acts as a mixing vessel, strand shifting often occurs during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly synchronous full-length and subgeneric RNA (RNA-RNA) can recombinate to form new coronaviruses.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination is found in both the HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in bat-like SARS-like coronaviruses and bat-like coronaviruses-HK9 (Coronavirus-HBK9-CoV-HK9).
Viral-zombie interaction with respect to transmission
Apart from the three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another important factor influencing the spread between species.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken to be a significant example, revealing evidence of positive selection during inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between the isolations of SARS-CoVs of the human and enteric cat, it is thought that SARS-CoV will undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, especially with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD in the S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the receptor and is actively selected by the host immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present in the S1 fragment at 318th to 510th amino acids, which bind to human ACE2 and its central receptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is capable of sensing the ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, thus facilitating inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found to differ from the human and civet pathogenic extractions in RBD, of which 4 are present in the receptor-binding trait to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, increasing the interaction of the spike protein with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, both of these amino acid alternatives are likely to be important for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is to be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the ana receptor with SARS-CoV by the same organism.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 (ACE2) in the S1 unit of the S protein may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study indicates that there is 10 to 20 times more affinity in this bond than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether the spread of SARS-CoV-2 requires any other co-receptor.
HCoV-NL63 binds to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are several HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptides N for HCoV-229E and 9-o-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after zoonotic transmission of their animal hosts.
As cell receptors go, the effect of the spread of HCoVs is also managed by other host dependency and control factors.
The difference in these omnivorous proteins between humans and HCoVs, such as bats, monolith camels, and rodents, could be a barrier to inter-species transmission.
Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) need to capture host-dependent factors, and minimize host-control factors for the spread between successful species.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of viral-homogeneous interactions will be identified and classified.
Impartial genome-wide testing on host dependency and control factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR will be fruitful
Exposure to novel human coronaviruses (HCoV): Back to basics
The diversity of bat coronaviruses offers ample opportunities for the development of novel HCoVs.
In this case, bat CoVs act as the genetic bank of HCoVs.
Additionally, rapid gene mutation and gene recombination drive the evolution of the HCoV, and this function functions as two important stages.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coded genes has the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
In SARS-CoV sub-proteins, it is considered important that ORF8 adapts to humans, since the SARS-CoV-related bat viruses encode different ORF8 proteins, even if they are extracted.
A 29-nucleotide elimination trait of SARS-CoVs has been detected in an isolated strain at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the mutation of host species.
Besides, SARS-CoV has a history of recombination with the lineages of alpha and gamma coronaviruses, in which a large number of small recombination regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Restructuring locations were identified in most of nsp9, nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, a pandemic known as MERS-CoV has been known to undergo recombinations between different lineages, occurring in monogamous camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs link with other animal coronaviruses to their non-structural genes.
One should be wary of the possibility that synthetic selection may contribute to unexpected changes in the virus's genes, often resulting in freeing the virus from selection pressures, such as the immune system of the host.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E root strain due to two nucleic acid decompositions.
Since uninfected ORF4 is found in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, aphaca alpha-coronavirus shows a single nucleic acid plug, resulting in a flammability.
One last thing, the evolution of novel HCoVs is driven by the selection pressure in their stagnant hosts.
Asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adaptiveity between CoVs and bats.
Bats appear to be well adapted to coronaviruses, both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the inflammatory reaction in bats effectively reduce the pro-inflammatory reaction by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the inhibition rearrangement of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94, and by the low exposure level of class I molecules with major ligand polypeptides.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the bats' high metabolic activity suppress CoV copying and affect verification by exorophocarboxylation thus providing the pressure for a generation of highly pathogenic viral mutations when introduced into a new mammal.
Recombination can result in more pathogenic CoV mutations, leading to the acquisition of novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
It is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their host, such as bats and camels.
They copy docilely without triggering a strong host immune response.
Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic pathogens are found and what causes severe infections in human infection.
The acute symptoms are mainly caused by the stimulation of the immune response and the cytokine spiral, in which if the immune response is strong, the lung damage can be very severe.
In contrast, in asymptomatic antigens, the immune response is removed from the CoV replication.
The same technique for eliminating the immune response can be beneficial in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The antiviral reaction is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the induction of type I interferon in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans is effective.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is impaired.
With this reasoning, it was known that prevention of NLRB3 (NLRP3) influenza with MCC950 (MCC950) can be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The origins of SARS-CoV-2 follow a common theme of the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-Cov has been found to have 95% nucleotide metformin affinity sharing with SARS-CoV, bat CoV that shares 96% nucleotide metformin affinity with SARS-CoV-2 has also been found to have CoV
Cats and other animals in the markets have been found to carry viruses similar to SARS-CoV, although the immediate intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Ant-CoV strains similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, indicating that ant-cells may act as one of the intermediate host or ant-beta-CoV strains may contribute to SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or unintentionally created by man.
Coronaviruses have re-emerged as a result of the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins in human transmission and animal reservoirs of HCoVs.
There is widespread evidence that the SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats and are transmitted to humans via intermediate hosts.
If the SARS-CoV infection stems from human-to-human contact, it could effectively end the SARS epidemic by closing the meat markets and killing the civets.
Considering the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolins beta-coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2, for the same reason, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal-borne transmission.
However, how SARS-CoV-2 spreads to humans through antlers and other mammals is still to be elucidated in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in monogamous camels for decades.
These camels are an important tool for transportation and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widely distributed throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is not possible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS virus, as was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach needs to be developed to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in conjunction with other infection control measures, to prevent repeated outbreaks of MERS.
Since we cannot eliminate these pathogens, new genotypes can emerge and cause serious outbreaks.
There are several types of CoVs present in the environment.
In particular, bat coronaviruses, which are capable of zoonotic infection, are very different.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and re-unite, resulting in the formation of new CoVs that will be more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China needs to be abandoned.
Along with the tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should also be a well-prepared response plan.
In fact, many viruses have been in the system for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many features that are positive for the transmission of pathogens, if humans have knowledge of this, it can reduce the chance of contact with bats and other wildlife species.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is essential for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which can be effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the best way to prevent the zoonotic spread of the virus is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic pathogens.
Several pieces of the mystery of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be discovered.
First, if bats spread the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological significance.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in the spread over humans, we need to find out how humans interact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it needs to be made clear how it interacts with a variety of species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and test infection should be conducted.
If it is bat, panther, or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent strains, which are almost identical, may be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continuous reviews in this area elucidate the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team issued a rapid advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provided our experience and developed a great reference point for fighting this pandemic globally.
It is also important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge of the disease is gradually increasing through the ongoing research findings and clinical practice experiences; therefore, strategies and treatments for detecting the disease are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we have responded to a comment on our guidance and provided new diagnostic guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China for “suspicious case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began to spread, and has now been officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
In order to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, our team has developed a Rapid Response Mechanism and it has been published on the website of Armed Forces Medical Research on 06th February 2020.
It has been getting a lot of attention since its release.
It may be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease and our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing due to the findings of ongoing research and clinical experience; therefore, the strategies and treatments for detecting the infection are also constantly being updated.
For example, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China published a report on COVID-19 from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020 on the Cults for Detection and Treatment (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), which contains seven versions, some of which have significantly changed the context.
Now we have feedback from Sue and others on our guidance and they have launched a simple assessment scheme based on their clinical experience.
Their work has given us a new source of guidance and a better understanding of the pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their remarkable work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for COVID-19 infection (Seventh Edition of the White Paper) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), to ensure that the infection is present, it must be accompanied by two subjects of clinical expression for the analysis of one or all of the infectious components, or, in the absence of a clear epidemiological history, it must satisfy three subjects of clinical expression.
History of outbreak: (1) traveled to or resided in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding areas, or in other community areas where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) had contact with people with mild or moderate infection with SARS-CoV-2 (symptomatic exposure to the virus and other respiratory symptoms in the school and surrounding areas), and (2) had a fever (symptomatic exposure to COVID-19 in the last 14 days preceding symptoms.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) having origins in COVID-19 infection; (3) the overall number of white blood cells is normal, low, or decreased at the onset of the outbreak.
Detection of confirmed case should be based on the suspected case with any pathological or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high degree of integrity to the known novel coronaviruses at the critical stage; (3) positive4-fold mutation of the virus to retrieve SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody to SARS-CoV-2 or positive for IgG antibody.
We can see that the real-time PCR test for the presence of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
In the fourth (27th January 2020) and fifth (8th February 2020) editions, the causative factors in blood samples have been included; after that, the germline evidence has been included in the seventh edition.
These changes, based on the researchers, continued the work of looking for an optimal nucleic acid detection device for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples taken from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported bringing a specific antibody positive result on confirmed criteria.
Besides, we have more and more evidence to be cautious with asymptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
"Therefore, we need to update the roadmap of Sue and others, who classify asymptomatic people as ""less dangerous""."
Further the score system in medical practice and studies needs to be checked.
In the end, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge, and we invite readers to give their opinions.
We recommend finding and complying with new guidelines issued in their home countries for diagnosing 'suspected cases' and 'confirmed cases'.
Our team will continue to provide guidance.
Bangladesh has recorded five new deaths due to COVID-19 in a single day, the highest number in a single day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the number of infections recorded by Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) stands at 114 cases and 33 recovered from the disease.
A total of 17 deaths have been reported.
At an online news conference, Dr Mirjadi Sabrina Flora, director of IETCR, said four men and one woman had died in the crash.
According to Dr. Meerjadi, two persons were above 60 years of age, two persons were between 51 to 60 years, and 41-50 years of age.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
Jalal Saipur Rahman, the director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission (BCC), who was being treated at the Kuwait Maitree hospital, was among the dead, a hospital official told local news agency Anadolu.
Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said in a video announcement on Saturday that public transport will remain suspended until Saturday, which is longer than originally planned.
The public transport shutdown was initially scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
Movement of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - is still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on March 8 were recorded for two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 1 million people worldwide.
The total number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections surpassed one million globally on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52 thousand deaths have been caused by COVID-19, the disease that causes the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection, i.e. its first coronavirus-related death in Zambia.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the few countries in the world to be free of the coronavirus.
By yesterday, the World Health Organization had recorded 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 new cases in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 a.m. on April 4. Central European Time (0800 UTC)
The US has reported more than 244 thousand coronavirus cases, which have been linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that more than 1,000 deaths were reported in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, announced that the city's closure will be extended until May 1.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will be paid without going to work until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the state of national emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against, and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews for a day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; previously, the curfew was in effect only from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand is planning to impose a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine has extended his stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia are reducing the amount of toilet paper for a transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles brought purchase control measures at all their stores nationally, at two and one-pack per transaction, respectively.
The definition of one pack per person was introduced by ALTI on Monday.
These limits were posted as news on the exit fronts and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers are known to be hoarding goods if people are self-isolating due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one parcel.
The changes follow a four-pack rate restriction for a previous transaction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
"In a March 8 media release, Coles called the four-pack restriction ""unprecedented"", calling the demand ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it ""unexpected""."
"A Woolworths spokesman said last week's sales had increased ""sharply""."
Costco's store in Canberra also restricted the amount allowed last week to two parcels.
To further quell the shortage, Coles not only issued orders for larger packages from suppliers but also increased delivery times. Woolworths shipped additional stocks, while ALDI prepared reserves for the special sale scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said the restrictions imposed by the local council on the delivery time of the goods are making it difficult for retailers to raise stock.
While suppliers are trying to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise as the critical raw materials required are less.
On Tuesday, the ALDI announced that some shops would not be able to operate the special Wednesday following the pre-release of stock consignments.
In a news.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail business expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up reserves every night.
He said that toilet paper is a bulky item which leads to less stock and then after everything is sold, the feeling of scarcity is further strengthened when it is found that the vast shelves are all empty.
'Coals and Woolworths are of the view that if there is a lot of material on the shelves, that [buyable] products such as toilet paper and cleaners can reduce the risk of fearlessness,' Russell Zimmerman said in an interview with ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper maker Who Gives a Grab said on Wednesday that they were running out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, the maker of Sorbent, say they work 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a news.com.au report.
Domain.com, the website for real estate auctions in Melbourne, reported that some property sellers offered to provide free toilet paper to first-time bidders.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included an eight-page plug-in that could be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia news report on March 3, the shops were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, and they said they had no plans to introduce any restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman said there is also a high demand for other items, including masks, disinfectants, dry goods, hand sanitizer and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday evening the virtual UK supermarket Ocado Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s limited the purchase of toilet paper to two 12-spoke packages.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday declared that COVID-19, a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a pandemic
"While the term ""pandemic"" refers to how widely a disease has spread, and not how dangerous specific diseases are, the World Health Organization (WHO) has noted the need for governments to take action: ""The first step is to prevent the spread of the disease."""
'All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
"Countries need to find, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their populations,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said."
'The spread and severity of the outbreak are alarmingly high, and the lack of action in this regard is alarming.'
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, director of the former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was 'unprecedented.'
"In a commentary published in CNN in February, he said, ""except for the flu, no other respiratory pathogens have been observed since the emergence of the virus and the subsequent international outbreak."""
"Gebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, ""We have never seen a pandemic triggered by a coronavirus before."""
"He said, ""We've never seen a pandemic that could be contained at the same time as the spread."""
In January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern and granted it a new status as a pandemic.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the spread, ""Mainly, it's going to get worse."""
As of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide stood at 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths, according to the Associated Press.
The 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 coronavirus pandemic is a 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that currently infects humans.
The outbreak was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. It was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, there have been about 1.61 million reported cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 34,000 people have recovered.
While China has a fatality rate of 4%, globally it is in the range of 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth while coughing, maintaining distance from others, surveillance and self-isolation from persons suspected to have been infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, enforcing lockdowns, workplace risk control, and workplace closures.
The pandemic has led to severe international socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages in the supply of panic-stricken goods.
Schools and universities have been closed nationwide or locally in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been instances of fear and discrimination against Chinese people, people from East and Southeast Asia and people with similar origins and other regions where the virus has a significant presence.
Air pollution and carbon emissions have been reduced as travel has been reduced and heavy industries have been closed.
Health officials in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, said that on December 31, 2019, a large number of people suffered from bronchitis without knowing what caused it, and an investigation began in early January 2020.
These patients often had contacts with the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus responsible for the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, which is a newly identified virus closely related to bat CoV, pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV. It is also known that the first person who is known to have symptoms has no known association with the virus.
In the early-stage cluster of victims in December 2019, it was found that two-thirds were in contact with the market.
An unconfirmed report by the South China Morning Post announced on 13-March 2020 that a 55-year-old patient from Hubei Province may have been the first patient and that this may have occurred on November 17, 2019. Although the number of new patients in China has declined, with sudden increases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on February-26, 2020 that the number of new patients coming to treatment outside China exceeded the number coming to China for the first time.
The incidence of infections among people with mild symptoms may have been significantly lower.
As of 26 February, relatively few young cases had been reported, with only 2.4% of patients aged 19 and under worldwide. England’s chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the UK population would have to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
These represent the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and those tests have been confirmed according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have official policies against testing people with moderate symptoms.
A study published on March 16 found that 86% of COVID-19 infections in China as of January 23 were undetected, and that these undetected infections infected 79% of confirmed cases.
The statistical analysis, published on March 30, estimated that there could be significantly more infections than were explicitly reported in Italy.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put the number at 5.7.
Many Covid-19 patients are recovering.
For those who do not take it, the time period from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths have occurred due to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, 80% of those who died were over the age of 60 and 75% of these patients had pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official protocols state that only those who tested positive for the coronavirus and died are generally counted in the official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.
The actual number of deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include those who die without testing - e.g. at home, care homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official coronavirus disease death toll by a factor of 4-5x.
"A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted that ""we are aware that [the death toll] has been underestimated""."
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, while the first death outside Asia took place in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths each had occurred outside mainland China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica, using a variety of different measurement methods.
The number varies over time depending on the region, and they vary by the amount of testing done, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the current period from the onset of the disease, demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health. The patient count and mortality rate are derived by dividing the number of deaths by the number of patients diagnosed at a given time interval.
As on 10th April 2020, the global Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as per Johns Hopkins University data.
The number varies by region.
In China, the ratio between cases and deaths dropped from 17.3% (asymptomatic persons as on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (asymptomatic persons as on 1 February 2020). Among other measures, the mortality rate (CFR-CFR) reflects the percentage of patients who have confirmed cases of a disease, and the mortality rate (CFR-CFR) reflects the percentage of those who have died of an infection (both diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These figures are undetermined and follow a specific group of people who have been infected by the pathogen.
Many educational institutions have tried to calculate this figure for a particular population.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford has estimated that during the pandemic, the fatality rate would be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The maximum estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized trial for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analysing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
"Maggie Bonnie of Penn State University said, ""Unchecked, once the infection usually reaches an unchangeable peak, then the disease-causing host begins to decline."
"But it's almost impossible to draw up any sensible plan at the moment about when that will be."""
Zhang Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, insisted that if all countries could mobilize to follow the World Health Organization's (WHO) advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus, it would be 'completed by June.'
"On March 17, Adam Kucharsky, of London's School of Health and Tropical Medicine, said that SARS-CoV-2 was ""going to be in circulation for sure, it will last for a year or two."""
According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine is available (which could take 18 months or more).
"William Schaffner, of Vanderbilt University, said: ""I don't think the coronavirus is going to disappear completely because it's so readily spread,"" but it could ""be a seasonal disease and come back every year."""
The severity of the reinfection depends on the immunity of the population and the size of the viral genome.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are not relatively defined and infected people may not be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory syncytial syndrome (RSS), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemorrhage, diarrhea, or blistering.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty getting up, and blueness of the face or lips as symptoms of an emergency. It is advised to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.
As some of the infected people are asymptomatic and asymptomatic, but have tested positive, the researchers have advised that those in close contact with confirmed cases should be closely monitored and tested to remain free of the infection.
The Chinese have estimated that the asymptomatic rate ranged from small to 44%.
The typical incubation period (period of onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this is typically five days. An example of uncertainty is that in people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell, the initial estimate was 30%, and then reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that the disease spreads primarily through close contact and through small droplets generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking, of which close contact is a distance of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that when left unattended, droplets can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to up to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that small droplets that can exit during speech stay in the air for long periods of time so that the virus can spread through it. Although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air, respiratory droplets can also exit during speaking, including when the air is exhaled.
The fluid droplets may go into the mouth or nose of nearby people or may be inhaled into the lungs.
The bronchial glands can be sprayed through certain medical procedures such as duct passage and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as a result of which the virus can spread in the air.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns that it may spread through feces on the one hand, it is believed that the likelihood of such a risk is low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 transmission from feces to the mouth, saying the virus is highly contagious in the first three days of symptoms, but there is a possibility of transmission before and after the onset of symptoms.
Some people are diagnosed three days before the onset of symptoms, so it is possible to spread the infection even before the onset of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic infections confirmed by the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified during contact tracing investigations by some countries.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while there is no clear information about the way the disease spreads, we do know that one person can usually transmit the virus to two to three others.
Specifically, the virus has been found to survive up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 grade steel, one day on cardboard, and up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies in terms of humidity and temperature and COVID-19 has been confirmed in pets and other animals as well.
While there is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, British officials advise washing one's hands after contact with animals as if infected people may have touched them after contact with other surfaces.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus that was originally isolated from three individuals with pneumonia who were in contact with a group of patients with acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of novel SARS-CoV-2 occur naturally in the associated CoVs. The virus is killed by household soap as it dissolves its protective coverings outside of the human body. SARS-CoV-2 is the SARS-CoV-associated original SARS-CoV
It is thought to have first spread from animals to humans.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the SARS-CoV (Genotype B) in the inner general population is composed of two strands derived from bats within the genus Beta-CoV.
This corresponds to 96% of the total genome of other bat coronavirus samples (Vaval COVID-19 RTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one amino acid difference in specific areas of the genome sequence between pathogens taken from pangolins and those that have spread to humans.
The 92% similarity in genetic material shared between Ant-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is insufficient to prove pangolins as a intermediate host in a full-gene comparison to date.
A viral infection can be detected temporarily based on symptoms, but can only be confirmed by replication of the antibody by a polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in infected secretions or by CT normalization.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR with CT suggested that although many graphical aspects of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT can show effects with significantly greater clarity than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT not be used as a first-line test or screening test for the detection of COVID-19."""
The World Health Organization (WHO), has published multiple RNA-RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first protocol was issued on January 17.
Test-resistance copying uses polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in real-time.
Respiratory or blood samples may be tested.
Results are usually available within a few hours.
Although throat swabs can also be used, in general, the test is performed on the nose swab. Many laboratories and institutions are developing urological testing methods to detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been confirmed to be accurate enough to be approved for widespread use.
The test, developed by Cellex, has been approved by certified laboratories in the United States for emergency use only.
Characteristic graphical features of radiographs and radiographs (CT) on people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral mirror opacities and non-pleural fluids.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international Internet database of random draft discoveries for confirmed cases.
In combination with other infections, such as adenoviruses, a normal draft is carried out without PCR confirmation and has a specific role in the identification of COVID-19.
A large-scale study carried out in China has demonstrated that although there is little chance of specific detection of infection by PCR, comparing CT results with PCR, the results can be quickly and accurately interpreted, suggesting that CT can be used as a diagnostic tool to assess the impact of the pandemic.
Artificial intelligence-based transitional neural networks have been developed to detect the draft characteristics of the virus with both radiographs and CT.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and performing acts such as coughing or sneezing into a tissue and placing the tissue directly in a garbage can.
Those already infected with the infection are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent the spread of the disease. Several governments have banned travel to and from countries and regions affected by the outbreak and against all non-essential travel.
However, the virus has reached the community transmission stage in much of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members may not know where or how they contracted the infection. Regular precautions, touch precautions and eye protection are recommended while caring for those who may have been infected.
The use of location data provided by mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised concerns over privacy violations, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations calling for a ban on the use of this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-neutral solutions, including recording a user's proximity using Bluetooth with other handsets.
Users will receive a text message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection are being spread; for example, nasal and mouthwashes are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19 yet, but several organizations are working on developing one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for a minimum of twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet, or while looking at their hands, even if they are contaminated; before eating; and after rinsing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the pathogen is killed by household soap, breaking down its protective bubble.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol in the absence of soap and water.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be purified by a number of solutions (within a minute of disinfecting the steel surface), including 62<0xE2><0x80><0x93>71% ethanol, 50<0xE2><0x80><0x93>100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solvents, such as benzalkonium chloride and chromhexidine gluconate, are less efficient.
The C.D.C. recommends that the office, toilets, common areas used by the sick person should be sanitized, including laptops, touch screens, keyboards, remote drives, electronic devices, etc., shared by all, in places where COVID infection is suspected, or where there are confirmed cases, or where there are day care centers.
Health agencies recommend that people should either bend their elbow during coughing or sneezing or cover their mouth and nose with tissue and dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those infected by the pandemic, as wearing a mask will limit the amount of droplets emitted during inhalation and travel distance that are dispersed when speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, 'The lack of proper hand hygiene is the main reason for the spread of the infection, and wearing a mask will reduce the urge for people to touch their faces.'
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also agree that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of masks by the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing a face mask that is not used in medical use made of cloth. China has also recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when using public transport or in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make homemade face masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam issued a request for people to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a grocery store to wear a mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million face masks a day since March, ordered passengers to wear masks on trains and city buses from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever going outside, while recommending making a mask at home for those who can't afford a mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control measures that delay the spread of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The measures include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or commercial centres.
Individuals can use social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using touchless greetings, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are mandating or recommending the practice of social distancing in infected regions.
The maximum limit for one-on-one gatherings, recommended by US government agencies and health authorities, was reduced from 250 people (if one locality is known to have no COVID-19 outbreak) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned the gathering of more than two people in public places, and the CDC advised people in areas with community transmission to ""stay away from people with chronic health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, high blood pressure and immunodeficiency"" and ""exercise as much as possible"" to reduce the risk of serious health problems and complications, and urged people in the community to stay at home as much as possible."
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has led people to assume that they should be completely isolated from society rather than encouraged to be in contact with each other in alternate ways. some officials have even issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic."
It is also recommended that you only have sex with a person who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those infected with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation and many governments have made or recommended self-isolation for the entire population living in the affected areas.
Strong self-isolation instructions have been issued to groups at high risk of transmission.
Those who may have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and have recently traveled to a country or region where the disease has spread widely are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the date of last exposure.
Control or suppression and mitigation are strategies to control the impact of the disease.
In the early stages of the outbreak, measures are being taken to control the spread, the aim being to identify and isolate the infected, and to introduce other measures to control the disease and to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts then move to mitigation: measures are taken to reduce the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society
Both prevention and mitigation measures can be carried out simultaneously.
More intensive measures are needed to suppress the pandemic by reducing the baseline number to less than 1. This is an attempt to reduce the epidemic peak as part of managing the spread of the pandemic, known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk to a large extent that health services cannot cope with and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be prepared.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the spread include individual preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing a mask and self-isolation; social activities aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling events where people gather together; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning. Slightly isolating entire cities and imposing severe travel bans, such as those known to control the spread in China.
Other countries have also taken various measures to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and localized quarantines, and issued warnings about the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore has offered financial assistance to those who have been infected and quarantined themselves and imposed major fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has also increased mask production and imposed fines on hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show major challenges are mitigation (preventing but not stopping the spread of the disease) and suppression (modifying the development of the pandemic).
Better preventive policies could reduce peak health care needs by two-thirds and mortality by half, but would result in tens of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.
Suppression of measures can be prioritized, but it must be protected as long as the virus continues to spread in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, whichever comes first) because the measures are relaxed and the spread can happen again more quickly.
The long-term disruption of the pandemic poses social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug against COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including testing existing drugs.
Taking medications for colds, drinking fluids, and taking a break available in pharmacies may help to limit symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be needed.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the effects.
Several compounds that were previously approved to treat other viral diseases are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) also noted that a few ""traditional and home remedies"" provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19."
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a fundamental response to the pandemic.
The European Regional Office of the ECDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at multiple levels, including centralizing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, revoking as many non-mandatory procedures as possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients and increasing intensive care capabilities by training staff and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first person to be infected (called a patient zero) was first infected.
The first case of novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei gradually increased.
These were often linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold living animals. And one theory is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, an animal-borne origin. A cluster of pneumonia caused by an unknown cause was detected on December 26 and given information by Zhang Jixian, a doctor at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, where he was treated by Zhang Jixian (DC).
"On December 30, a team of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital had warned their colleagues of a ""sars-like coronavirus""."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false rumors, and Ai Fen, another doctor, was reprimanded by his superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notification on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization (WHO).
In early January, health officials in Wuhan were informed of cases of inadequately diagnosed pneumonia, which was enough to initiate an investigation, and in the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases nearly doubled to seven and a half days.
In the beginning and middle of January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, with the help of displacement and the presence of Wuhan as the center and main transit point during the Chinese New Year.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy as the world’s highest number of confirmed infections. As of 9 April 2020, 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths, and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
More than 200 countries and territories have reported at least one case of the disease.
Due to the pandemic's large spread in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement between them and set up border controls.
National reactions include quarantines (called stay-at-home orders, stay-at-home orders or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90%, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, with more than 50 million people in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and a further 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, a rise from 2.6 billion two days later - a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another unconfirmed report, the first case was reported on November 17.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian identified a cluster of patients with pneumonia with an unknown cause. The hospital where he worked was informed by the Wuhan Jiangan CDC (CDC) on December 27.
Initial genetic testing of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of SARS-like CoV.
A public announcement was made by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
It was reported to the World Health Organization the same day.
After the announcement, police warned doctors in Wuhan of 'spreading rumours' about the outbreak.
"China's National Health Commission initially stressed that there was ""no clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission."
"In late January, the Chinese government launched an aggressive campaign, which Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China, described as a ""people's war"" to curb the spread of the virus."
"Described as the ""largest quarantine in human history"", a sanitation curfew was announced on January 23 to halt travel in and out of Wuhan, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people."
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) has been canceled in many places.
A temporary hospital, Huoshanshan Hospital, was built in 10 days and completed, officials said.
Another hospital, Leisure Hospital, was built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan into temporary hospitals, such as conference centers and sports stadiums. On January 26, the government took additional measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, including issuing health notices to passengers and extending the spring festival holiday.

Remote work activities have been established in many Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were implemented both inside and outside Hubei.
Public transport has been rerouted and museums across China are temporarily closed.
After public movement restrictions were imposed in several cities, an estimated 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of external restrictions. after the outbreak entered its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took drastic measures to prevent the virus from 'importing' from other countries.
For example, the Beijing administration had implemented a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city on March 23, five days before that, in the Chinese mainland, there was only one domestic case, that was a passenger who had returned from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that the outbreak had been largely contained domestically and that the outbreak was under control in China.
Travel restrictions were eased on the same day in Hubei, with the exception of Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on March-26, 2020 that entry permits for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28.
Those wishing to enter China will need to apply for a visa at the Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen, and offered cash incentives to those companies.

The central government asked families to pay tribute online to maintain physical distancing to avoid the re-emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The country's health agency said the number of confirmed cases had risen significantly on February 20, due to a gathering in Daegu on behalf of a new religious movement called Shincheonji Jesus Church.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of February 22, of the 9,336 individuals following that church, 1,261 or 13 percent had been diagnosed with symptoms. South Korea issued a high-level warning on February 23<0xE2><0x80><0x93>2020.

South Korea introduced what is considered to be the world's largest and best-arranged program to detect the spread of the virus among the general public, isolate those who are infected, and track and isolate those who have come in contact with them.
The diagnostic methods include mandatory self-declaration of new international travelers symptoms through a mobile app, a drive-thru test for testing for viral impact depending on the results available the next day, and an increase in testing capacity to test up to 20,000 people each day.
While not isolating entire cities, South Korea's plan is considered to have been successful in containing the spread. There were initially two divergent views in South Korean society regarding President Moon Jae-in's actions in dealing with the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's resignation because of the government's mishandling of the pandemic.

The impact of the coronavirus pandemic has been attributed to a number of factors, including a lack of supplies, increased use of equipment globally to fight the epidemic, increased purchases of goods over demand due to fear of non- causalities and disruption of industrial and logistical operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and supply disruptions.
The panic buying in many localities has led to a shortage of food, toilet paper and essential grocery items such as bottled water.
The tech industry had specifically warned of delays in the export of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand has led to an increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has caused a delay of four to six months in the supply of medical supplies.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned of a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) that could endanger health care workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Tycoon merchants to sell Australian goods into China.
This activity was later banned by the Australian government as it caused a shortage of children's food in some supermarkets.The impact of COVID-19 was greater in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, where demand for food products was high, and both regions survived severe food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy against hoarding and illegal trade of critical products have been successful, avoiding the acute food shortages expected in Europe and North America.
In northern Italy, which has significant agricultural output, there has not been a major drop in production, but industry representatives are concerned that prices could rise.
Even in the city of Wuhan, where the food stalls were temporarily empty, Chinese government officials released pig stores and ensured that the public had enough food to eat.
There are also laws in Italy that require food producers to have reserves for such emergencies.
Damage to the global economy was felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, as a result of the government’s measures to contain the spread of the virus, China’s economy was hit the hardest in the first two months of 2020 and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
With China being the world's largest economic and manufacturing hub, the spread of the virus is seen as the biggest threat to the stability of the global economy.
The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has predicted that the markets will remain volatile until clarity on the potential consequences emerge.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the economic downturn due to the current pandemic would be greater than the one caused by the SARS pandemic during 2002-2004.
An expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis estimates that the world's $300 billion supply chain could be impacted for up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has been hit hard by a sharp fall in oil prices due to a fall in China's procurement demand.
Global stock markets collapsed on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 infections outside the Chinese mainland.
On February 27, various U.S. stock market indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 (S&P) index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell by 1,191 points for the first time since 2008, the biggest one-day fall since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indexes fell more than 10% over the weekend.
On 28 February, Scope Value Certification Company GmbH confirmed China's sovereign currency rating, but extended a negative outlook for the future.
Shares fell again based on fears of the coronavirus, the highest of which occurred on March 16.
Many people think that there is an economic crisis.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the emergency measures taken by the central banks and the government in a timely manner.
Central banks are doing much better than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism sector remains one of the most affected sectors by travel bans, closure of public places including travel destinations, and governments' advice against any travel around the world.
As a result, a large number of airlines, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, have cancelled flights due to low demand, while the UK's regional airline, Flybe, has suffered a decline.
There has been an unprecedented impact on the cruise industry.
Several railway stations and ferries have been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Sunyun, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many events involving large gatherings, including annual New Year's Eve celebrations, have been cancelled by national and regional governments, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Various New Year's Eve events and tourist attractions were closed to avoid crowds, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple displays in Beijing.
Authorities in municipalities and localities in 24 of China's 31 provinces have extended the New Year holiday until February 10, advising most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong closed schools until March and canceled New Year's celebrations, raising infection response levels to the highest level and declaring a state of emergency. The retail sector has been hit globally due to reduced store hours or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a 50-60% decline.
This is a 33<0xE2><0x80><0x93>43 per cent drop in customer visits to sales centres in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world have taken additional measures, such as increased health measures, installing thermal scanners to test the temperature of shoppers and canceling events, according to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (UNECA) that the pandemic-induced slowdown is projected to subject between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America to extreme poverty, compared to a situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, when Wuhan was at the peak of the pandemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
China's nearly 300 million suburban migrant workers are stranded at home in the inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could cause 47 million job losses in the United States and an unemployment rate of 32%. The lockdown in India has left several million Indian migrant workers (daily wage earners) unemployed. An Angus Reid survey found that nearly 94% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment since March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for Universal Credit, and nearly half a million companies in Germany sent their employees to work under the state-subsidized short-term work program known as the Cuzabayt.
France and the United Kingdom are following Germany's short-term work compensation scheme.
The fields of performing arts and cultural heritage have been hit hard by the pandemic, affecting the operations of companies and individuals - those with permanent jobs and independent staff - globally.
The arts and culture sector organizations sought to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to society, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists as much as possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions around the world and to varying degrees, have indefinitely cancelled or postponed or closed their exhibitions, events and performances.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through computer platforms, including religious services, important sporting events, and the cancellation of music festivals and other social events such as concerts, technical conferences and costume shows.
The film industry has also suffered disruptions, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week observances in Rome during the last week of Lent's Christian Lenten season.
Several dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday prayer meetings; some churches offer church services via radio, live broadcast or television, and some offer services for worship in a drive-in mode.
The Roman Catholic Diocese closed its churches and other religious organizations such as churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras following the expulsion of Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square have also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas, after which shrines were also closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its own citizens to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused significant disruption to the holding of sporting events on a global scale since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 UEFA Champions League, 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 Major League Soccer, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 NBA season and the 2019<0xE2><0x80><0x93>20 NHL season.
"The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would ""be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020, but not later in the summer of 2021""."
This has led many gamblers to move to the internet. Many online gambling sites have significantly raised the fees for new entrants. The entertainment industry has also been affected. In this, various music groups have postponed or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, have stopped all shows.
"Some artists have found new ways to produce and share content online, such as creating web-based ""festival"" events for live concerts or artists to perform, distribute and promote their work, as an alternative to traditional live performance."
Online, a large number of coronavirus-themed internet memes have led to a shift of humor and attention for many amidst the instability.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, people of Chinese and East Asian heritage have been subjected to discrimination, fear and xenophobia against people of Europe, the United States and other countries where the impact of the pandemic has been the highest.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (where most of the impact was only in China) documented racist sentiments expressed against various groups of Chinese people around the world, as if you deserved the virus, or that it was a fair punishment.
Anti-China sentiment has also increased in some African countries.
Many of the residents of Wuhan and Hubei have complained of discrimination based on their regional origins.
The aid came both online and in-person from China in areas affected by the virus.
Italy, the first country in Europe where COVID-19 spread intensively, is also likely to be subject to suspicion and racism as the spread continues to intensify to new hotspot countries. Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries in a bid to curb the disease.
The hashtag <0x23>ChineseDontComeToJapan is very popular in Japan.
Chinese people in the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as other Asian countries, have reported an increase in racist insults and attacks against them.
"US President Donald Trump has been criticised by critics for referring to the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"" and calling it a ""racist and anti-Chinese phenomenon""."
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign nationals from Wuhan to Novi Sanshari.
Students from India's north-eastern states, which share a border with China and are based in other major cities of India, are at risk of being swept away in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
"West Bengal BJP state unit chief Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese destroyed nature and that is why ""God took revenge"" against them."
"The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Kolkata as ""misleading""."
Several newspapers have removed the option of displaying e-mails only to subscribers on their website so that news related to the coronavirus can be read in part or in full.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers available to anyone who wants to read them.
Some scientists have chosen to quickly share their results on pre-print servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 include methods of detecting the presence of the virus and the antibodies produced in response to the pandemic.
The RT-PCR method of detecting RNA-RNA of coronavirus has confirmed the presence of the virus in samples.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA (RNA) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the most recent or active infections.
The antibody detection method can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people had the infection, including those with low levels of symptoms or asymptomatic.
The exact mortality rate and herd immunity caused by the disease in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on viral incidence in their total population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had carried out tests on more than 3% of its population, and there is a huge variation in the number of people tested depending on countries.
This variant may significantly affect reported mortality rates, with some countries likely to be significantly higher.
Real-time reverse transcription can be performed using polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal palpation or coagulated sampling.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR test taken from the throat using a swab will give a reliable result only in the first week of the infection.
The virus then hides in the throat, but the lung continues to grow.
During the second week of testing in the patients, alternative samples can be used either through the suction catheter from the inside of the respiratory tract or through a cough syrup.
One of the earliest PCR tests was developed using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) at Charite in Berlin in January 2020, and formed the basis of 250,000 kits to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 23, 2020, the UK had also developed its own diagnostics system, based on the CogenBiotech PCR-based clinical standard of SARS-CoV-2 (PowerSek Corona Virus) on January 28, 2020.
"It targets the ""E"" gene shared by all beta CoVs, and the SARS-CoV-2 RTP gene specific to SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the World Health Organization (WHO)."[citation needed] In China, the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 virus is one of the most common strains of the 2019 pandemic. in the United States, the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 is the first clinical application of SARS-CoV-2."
One of the three previous versions of the test kits had given vague results due to faulty test kits, resulting in less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day on average throughout February 2020.
As of February 28, 2020, tests using two components have not been determined to be reliable, and state and local laboratories have not been allowed to carry out tests until then.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under an emergency use authorization, and commercial labs in the US began testing it in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, Labcorp announced that COVID-19 testing methods based on RT-PCR are available across the country.
As on 9th March 2020, Quest Diagnostics has enabled nationwide testing for COVID-19
No quantity limits have been notified; sample collection and processing has to be carried out in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 testing system was developed and manufactured by Vector, the state research center for virology and biotechnology.
The trial was recorded on February 11, 2020 by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Health Care. It was announced on March 12, 2020 that Mayo Clinic has developed a test system to detect COVID-19 infection. The highest testing within 3.5 hours, i.e., a single machine was acquired by Roche Diagnostics Food and Drug Corporation (DFDC) on March 13, 2020 for the optimal testing method to perform about 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test Abbott's M2000 system; similar authorization has been granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to Hollogic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Sebeit received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an experimental method that takes 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved the test that uses co - thermal incineration technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require alternating temperature cycles, the method can deliver confirmatory results in as little as five minutes and negative results in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 machines in the United States, with Abbott looking to ramp up production to as much as 50,000 tests per day. An experimental system using a monoclonal antibody that binds to the ovarian protein (my protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan. If successful, there is hope that it could deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the Rapid Flu test.
"A March 2020 article study suggested that ""in the early stages, chest x-rays are less likely to be detected, whereas CT [computed tomography] results may even show signs of pre-symptom onset."""
Common features in CT include a two-sided multilayer floor-glass opacity with external, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, it can lead to subpleural dysplasia, slurred breathing, and hardening.
At the point when the current pandemic began in Wuhan, a study comparing PCR with CT suggested that although many of the graphical features of CT overlap with other pneumonias and disease processes, CT was significantly more accurate than PCR.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT not be used as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19 or for a first-line test"". as of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of PCR for initial testing."
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals who have 7 or more days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity, and also in people’s surveillance. They can be evaluated at Central Laboratories (CLT) or at Care Testing Points (PoCT-BOCT).
These assessments can be carried out by high-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories, but their availability depends on the rate of production of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to follow the immune response.
For POCT test, a sample of blood is usually obtained by making a small incision in the skin.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 26, 2020 released the names of 29 companies who have been certified to distribute their antibody tests as they provide information to the company as required.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization. Euroimmunomedical laboratory diagnostics approved by the European Institutes for Diagnostic Diagnostics and Epidemiology for the preparation of IgG (IgG) and IgA (IgA) antibodies that serve against the virus from blood samples.
Being capable of testing several hundred samples within a few hours, the pathogen will deliver results much faster than the usual PCR (PCR) assessment of RNA - RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection, and they found in early April that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the UK were suitable for use.
"Hong Kong has set up a plan to allow suspected patients to stay at home and get a test result a short time after they are sent back by ""a sample tube delivered to a patient by the emergency department""."
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea conduct much faster, more comprehensive tests than any other country. The National Association of Legal Insurance Physicians of Germany said on March 2 that South Korea has the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day through the mobile system and 10,700 tests were carried out in the past week.
When a doctor orders a test, the cost is borne by the health insurance company.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a cumulative capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, the tests were given in-vehicle in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany is unknown as Germany only reports the number of confirmed test results.
"In the first laboratory study, 33,491 samples (or 6.9%) of 483,295 samples tested, including week 12/2020, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China. ""Scientists were able to screen for SARS-CoV-2 on day one"" in English: ""SARS-CoV-2 was tested for SARS-CoV-2 on day 5"". 2000 samples were collected and analyzed in hospital.
Modelling methods show that the number of patients in Hubei would have risen by 47% if the five-day trial, developed under the direct supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian, had not been implemented, and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled.
Hu-Yan labs in a total of 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, have been following the Wuhan lab's operations closely.
By March 4, 2020, the daily efficacy was a total of 50,000 tests per day. Open source, multiplex designs published by Origami Assays have been released, which can test 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 assays. These uniform designs can be operated in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
By March, shortages of testing material and a lack of adequate stock had become a barrier to mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US.
This led some creators to examine the 5-minute warm-up protocol for samples requiring release of RNA genomes for further testing. The UAE announced on March 31 that it was testing large numbers of its population compared to other countries and was on track to increase the size of its population.
"This is carried out by purchasing drive-thru facility and a high-performance laboratory (based on Hu-Yan Emergency Diagnostic Laboratories in China) depending on population from Group 42 and BGI."
Constructed in 14 days, the lab is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind outside China with such capacity globally.
Different test procedures targeting different parts of the CoV genome profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted the German process for manufacturing equipment for low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own tools.
The German follow-up process was released on 17-January 2020; testing in the United States was delayed until January-28 because the protocol developed by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States was not available.
On the contrary, experts say that South Korea's large-scale testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capacity, mostly in private sector labs, was built by the South Korean government over the years.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advised on March 16 that expediting testing plans is the best way to slow the pace of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of tests were pending in private U.S. laboratories due to the need to conduct high-level testing due to the increasing spread of the virus, and availability of fentanyl and chemicals was difficult.
In March 2020, China announced that there were problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
In the United States, there were 'deficiencies' in the test kits developed by the CDC; the government then lifted the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co., but the results were found to be incorrect.
The company explained that the incorrect results may have been the result of mistakes in the collection of samples or in the proper use of tools.
Spain's ministry said it would withdraw the kits that gave false results and instead offer a different test kit provided by Shenzhen BioEC. 80% of the test kits purchased from the Czech Republic gave false results, and 1.2 million test kits purchased from Slovakia from China were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Madovic suggested throwing them into the Danube. Turkish Health Ministry Atte Kara said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a 'high error rate' and 'could not be put to use.' The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unfit for use.
The process of testing and tracing of people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and those who have come in contact with them has yielded positive results
Researchers in the Italian city of Voith, where the first COVID-19 death occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests over the space of about ten days at a population of about 3,400.
Half of the confirmed cases have no symptoms and all the confirmed cases have been isolated.
As travel to the municipal council was banned, it completely eliminated the new infections.
Despite the absence of severe restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and retail establishments, the outbreak of the 2020 coronavirus in Singapore has spread at a much slower rate than other developed countries due to the intensity of contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
Many events have been cancelled and Singapore began advising its residents to stay at home on March 28, but schools reopened in a timely manner after a holiday break on March 23.
Several countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have followed a low-intensity lockdown, while managing the spread of the infection through intensive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing and quarantine.
One statistical study found that compared to the death toll, the countries with the highest testing had the lowest death rates, as these countries were able to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing facilities and national laboratories that do not have much experience with COVID-19 should send their first five confirmed samples to one of the 16 WHO-prescribed laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Among the 16 recommended labs are 7 labs in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"In the following chart, the column ""Test Confirmed %"" is affected by a country's policy on testing."
While others are equal, the country's testing-dependent confirmed cases will only test those admitted to hospitals, compared to a country that tests all citizens, regardless of whether or not they have symptoms.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the removal of soil, oilseeds, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from a person's hands.
"Continuous handwashing with soap at certain ""important moments"" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhea and cholera. they are transmitted through the feces and oral."
People can also be exposed to respiratory diseases, such as the common cold or the flu. For example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., cetaceans), they can become infected.
The five most important moments to wash hands with soap in a day are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s bottom or changing nappies, before feeding the baby, before and after meals, and before and after preparing food or handling uncooked meat, fish, or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, you can clean your hands with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
Before cooking, after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who has used the toilet.
Wash your face after coughing or sneezing.
After touching the waste of animal, animal feed or animal feed.
Medical hand hygiene refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Hand-washing can prevent or reduce the spread of disease before providing medication or medical care.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people dealing with or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing child mortality rates.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing habits among children under the age of five may help increase height in small doses.
In developing countries, childhood mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce the incidence of diarrhea by one-third, compared to the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap is the most effective and cheapest way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as is the case in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia is the leading cause of acute respiratory infections and the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, nearly half the deaths from diarrhea, and nearly a quarter of the deaths from acute respiratory infections.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other health initiatives as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) programmes.
Hand washing protects against the evils that are spread through direct physical contact.
A minor detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Denmark study found that excessive hand washing can lead to a eroding, uneven skin condition known as eczema or dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a sign of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times to wash hands with soap to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after using the bathroom (kidnapping, defecating), after cleaning the bottom of a child (changing clothes), before feeding the child, before and after preparing food and/or handling uncooked meat, fish or domesticated meat.
Before and after treatment of cut or injury while adopting proper hand washing technique to prevent the spread of disease; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries revealed that 38.7% of households use soap. In 2014, Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of washing hands with soap at 97%; the United States had the highest rate of washing hands with soap; China had the lowest rate of washing hands with soap at 77%; and China had the lowest rate of washing hands with soap at 23%.
The "Essential Health Plan" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example measure to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, in addition to hand washing daily with soap and flossing daily with fluoride are the focus areas of the National Programme.
It has also been used successfully in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main function of soaps and washing powders is to reduce the barriers of solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because the fats and proteins that are components of organic soil are not readily soluble in water.
However, the cleaning is aided by an adequate stream of water.
Solid soap, due to its recyclable nature, may contain bacteria derived from previous applications.
A small number of studies that have monitored the spread of infectious bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transmission is not possible as the bacteria are washed away by the foam.
The CDC still states that “liquid soap with hands-free controls is preferable”.
Anti-bacterial soaps have been greatly encouraged for the health-conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that antibiotics are selective in nature due to the use of recommended disinfectants or disinfectants.
However, anti-bacterial soaps contain typical anti-bacterial factors, such as triclosan, which has a comprehensive list of species-resistant strains.
Therefore, while antibacterial soaps have not been selected, they may not be as effective when marketed.
In addition to peripheral applications and a skin-protecting factor, sophisticated formulations include pH-regulated acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), benzoic acid that acts as an antibacterial agent, as well as an antibacterial agent, such as benzoic acid, which can also be removed from the liver, liver, green camphor, and vegetative extracts.
Hot water that is convenient for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
At body temperature (37 <0xC2><0xB0>C), bacteria grow very fast.
Warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water to remove the natural oil that retains dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies show that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the number of microorganisms in the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-based, hands-free hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and into the early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene factors (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to become popular.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening material such as a carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to form a gel or a moisturiser such as glycerin for simple use and to reduce the alcohol drying effect.
The addition of diluted hydrogen-peroxide further enhances the antimicrobial activity. Cleansers with at least 60 to 95% alcohol are efficient disinfectants.
Alcohol-containing cleaners kill bacteria, co-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE) tuberculosis and certain pathogens (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis), and fungi.
Alcohol rubbing cleansers with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 concentration reduction, equal to 35 decibels reduction) bacteria in the hands within 30 seconds of use and act 99.999% to 99.999% (lower concentration reduction from 4 to 5 concentrations) against some bacteria in 1 minute of use.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer fluids are completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) type viruses, a common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Rub enough hand antiseptic or alcohol and use both hands to wet or cover well.
The nodules and ends of both hands and all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries out.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends washing your hands with hand sanitizer, especially when your hands are dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their simplicity and rapid destruction measures against micro-organisms; however, they should not act as a substitute for proper hand washing if soap and water are not available
If you do not have a fire extinguisher and/or a fire extinguisher, you may be able to use a fire extinguisher to extinguish the fire.
The alcohol drying effect can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other decongestant drugs to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness rather than soaps or anti-microbial washing powder.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or excessive skin resistance to alcohol or hand itching that rarely occurs through additives in alcohol.
One attraction is the low incidence of annoying, touch-induced dermatitis compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water factors do not cleanse organic materials in the hands, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers, like soap and water, are not effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens because the pathogens still remain on the hands.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer performance is heavily dependent on its ingredients and formulation, and historically mainly alcohol and alcohol hand sanitizers have been less efficient.
More recently, perhaps because of progressive adverse skin reactions, unlike the alcohol that has been shown to decrease performance due to repeated use, composition schemes that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have continuous and overall anti-microbial activity after use.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and use ash or soil instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than using water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microbes, it could exacerbate the disease rather than reduce its spread.
Like soap, ash can act as a disinfecting agent because when it comes in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The World Health Organization recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap was not available.
The following steps are recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
Wash your hands in hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended, because standing water may be contaminated, while the temperature of the water does not make a difference.
Gently rub your hands with soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and the base of the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands better when using soap than when using water alone.
Press for at least 20 seconds.
Pressing rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and prolonged rubbing removes more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the vessel can be contaminated again.
Allow it to dry with a clean towel or dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are susceptible to infection. Usually the areas that are missed without proper cleaning are under the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and the fingernails.
Artificial nails and granulated nail polish can make room for microbes.
Moisturizing ointment is often recommended not to dry hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
A variety of low-cost options can be arranged for hand washing in areas without tap-water and/or soap. For example, pouring water from a hanging vase or cauldron through an appropriate drain and/or use of ash if developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are water-saving solutions.
"A dippie-tape is a simple technique of using a pitcher that is tilted by a rope, and containing a foot-operated lever and soapy duct to pour a small amount of water over the hands."
Hand washing is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about how to dry in public toilets.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London and sponsored by the Paper Towels Manufacturing Factory and the European Tissue Symposium, the study helped compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and modern jet air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in a hot-air dryer, the number of bacteria increases by 194% on the fingers and 254% on the palms.
Drying hands with an e-wind dryer increases the number of bacteria by 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palms.
The total number of bacteria in the finger area after hand washing and wiping with paper towels was reduced to an average of 76% and up to 77% in the palms.The scientists conducted a series of experiments to see if each type of drying method resulted in other users in the bathroom and whether the environment of the room was likely to cause cross-contamination.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out at a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h;400 mph), is capable of blowing micro-organisms from hands and instrumentation and is likely to contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads germs up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels do not show significant microbial spread, and a 2005 study by T<0xC3><0x9C>V Produkt und Umwelt evaluated different drying methods.
The following changes were observed in bacterial count after drying hands:
There are many hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared against drying by paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizers is an alternative in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers must contain at least 60% alcohol.
It was made mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the benefit of medical hand washing in preventing disease in the hospital environment (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff when they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Medical hand washing involves rubbing every part of the hands with soap and water or gel liberally for at least 15 seconds.
Hands should be clasped together.
If there are debris under the fingernails, a brush can be used in a bristle to remove it.
Since germs can be in the water on the hands, it is important to wash well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to stop the water (and, if necessary, open the exit door).
This avoids the re-contamination of the hands from those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health-care settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("worms") and prevent them from spreading.
The New England Journal of Medicine notes that in most medical environments, hand-washing is unacceptable, with a large number of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading germs.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures could reduce the rate of circulatory infections related to urinary tracts by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a study article demonstrating quality hand washing and hand rubbing in health care fields.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene have been put up on the organisation's website for comments from the public.
A relevant study was conducted by Witpy et al.
Commercial organizations can measure and assess the health of the hands if there is a need for an explanation of the degree of compliance with regulation.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five moments to wash your hands:
After exposure to blood / body fluids
prior to the onset of the disease, and
After patient care. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soap ("drug" or "antimicrobial" soaps) provides the ability to disinfect the hand-washing liquid.
Such a disinfection operation may be preferred before surgery or in settings where antibiotic-resistant organisms are most found. It is necessary for a surgery to have a water tube that can open and close, without touching, to <0xE2><0x80><0x98>stretch’ one’s hands. This is by hand, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, another of the mains for washing the underside of the nail, and a towel for washing.
You have to remove all the tags.
The procedure involves washing the hands and forearms up to the elbows, usually for 2<0xE2><0x80><0x93>6 minutes.
There is no need for long scrub times (10 minutes).
When washing, the water in the forearms should be stopped from flowing back into the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfectant cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or to use a hand toxin.
In order to control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the greatest benefit by hand sanitising came from the first 20% of washing, and the lowest added benefit when the hand sanitizing frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Washing with an anti-bacterial soap is more than three times the rate of bacterial infection transmitted through food. Hand washing with an alcohol-based solution for a period of 30 seconds is anti-bacterial. Hand-washing with an anti-bacterial soap is 26% more effective than hand-washing with an anti-bacterial soap.
H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium spores reduce the hardness of hands with soap and water better than alcohol-based hand washes. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings include advising staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand washing, and providing staff with written and verbal reminders.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions is most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for achieving good health, and good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand-washing facilities in people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes it challenging to achieve universal hand-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are fewer handwashing taps near private or public toilets despite cheaper possibilities to create handwashing spaces.
However, less frequent hand washing may be more common than soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand-washing with soap can affect policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand-washing and lead to a change in people's long-term behavior.
Monitoring and evaluation are essential for this to work well.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that increasing hand-washing in LMICs was effective, while social media-based campaigns were less effective. One example is UNICEF’s “three-star approach”, an action plan to promote hand-washing in schools, which encourages schools to take steps to ensure, among other health needs, that students wash their hands with soap, at no cost.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can eventually move from one to three-star status.
The creation of hand-washing stations is part of the hand-washing promotion campaigns carried out to reduce diseases and child deaths.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of the campaign to increase awareness of trying to achieve behavioural change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have suggested that the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in the developing countries associated with talismans has been avoided.
However, one study suggests that encouraging hand washing with soap is significantly less expensive than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for those in vulnerable conditions such as mothers who were born or injured soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English ""Founder of modern nursing""."
At that time, most people believed that the disease was caused by a bad smell called Myasmus.
After foodborne illness and health-related infections in the 1980s, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention actively promoted hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters on ""proper hand-washing techniques"" are hung near hand-washing tanks in public toilets, office buildings and toilets at airports in Germany."
"The meaning of the phrase ""to wash one's hands"" from something is to convey one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or to share composure with it."
It derives from the biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands frantically while trying to clean up a fictitious stain, which makes her feel guilty about the crimes she committed and the crimes that prompted her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or thinking of immoral acts, and respect hand washing tools more.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after such thinking are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Simbalik hand washing, using water, but no soap for washing hands, is part of ritual hand washing that is practiced in many religions, including the Baha'i faith in Judaism, Hinduism, Tevila and Netilat Yadayim, Lavabo in Christianity, and Vudu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam make it mandatory to wash hands after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam have all mandated washing of hands before and after every meal.
Work-related risks associated with COVID-19
Use of occupational safety and health measures for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) workplace risk controls related to COVID-19.
The formal workplace risk controls are based on the workplace and workplace, the sources of infection risk, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of individual workers who are likely to have been infected with COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure risk occupations have limited work-related interactions with the public and other colleagues. Basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, following appropriate respiratory protocols, and maintaining cleanliness and disinfection of the work environment.
Mid-level risk-affective tasks include frequent or close contact with people who are likely to be affected by the current community transmission, such as unknown or suspected COVID-19 patients or those who have travelled internationally.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, densely populated work environments, and some large-scale retail organizations.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk controls for this group include better ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneezing blockers, and personal protective equipment that can be worn in the event of meeting a person infected with COVID-19.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers the health and morgue workers at high risk of contracting COVID-19 from a known or suspected person, or at high risk of transmitting the virus to employees who are at high risk of developing the virus or of collecting or handling samples from a known or suspected person.
Risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as rooms with negative pressure ventilation, and appropriate personal protective equipment suitable for the workplace.
COVID-19 can have a number of effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be able to return to work due to health issues, the need to care for others, or the fear of contracting an infection.
The forms of business may change due to changes in the goods demanded and the means of obtaining the goods (such as going to purchase goods or getting them through supply or drive-thru services at times when there is not much crowd).
Finally, exports of goods from geographical areas that have been severely affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan may be used to guide safety measures.
Plans specify risk levels associated with various workplaces and work tasks, including sources of vulnerability, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors related to individual workers who are elderly or chronically ill.
They outline the restrictions necessary to avoid risks and plan for the foreseeable future for situations that may result from the outbreak.
Pandemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or advisory recommendations.
Targets for responding to the infection include reducing transmission among employees, protecting those at high risk for serious health complications, maintaining business operations and reducing the incidence of adverse effects on other companies in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects the responses received in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in the fields of occupational safety and health to group risk controls by performance.
Where COVID-19 risks are unavoidable, engineering-based controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally the use of personal protective equipment are the most effective control methods.
Engineering controls include isolating employees from work-related risks without relying solely on employee behavior, which is an easy-to-implement solution.
Administrative control refers to the change in procedures or policies that are required to take action by an employee or employer.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE-PPE) is considered to be less efficient than engineering and administrative controls, but these can help prevent certain risk insurability conditions.
PPEs (PPEs) should be selected based on the risk to the employees and should be appropriately fit (e.g., breathing apparatus), uniformly worn, periodically inspected, maintained and replaced if required, and should be properly removed, cleaned, stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have little professional contact with the public and other colleagues.
Frequent and systematic washing of hands, encouraging workers to stay at home if sick, respiratory regulations including covering their mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, installing tissue and dustbins, working remotely or managing break-in hours if necessary, recommending disinfection measures for all workplaces, cleaning and disinfecting tools and equipment, and routine work.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons at risk of infection in a workplace is an important step towards protecting workers, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with acute respiratory illness symptoms stay home as long as they have fever, flu symptoms, and no other symptoms after taking fever-reducing or other symptoms-modifying medications for at least 24 hours. Medical leave policies are flexible, allowing employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and staff to be informed of these policies.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), unknown or suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 due to the current community transmission around the business area are considered to be work-related risk, with COVID-19 patients or individuals who have recently traveled internationally to an area with a large COVID-19 outbreak within a distance of six feet (1.8 m) where frequent or close contact is required.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public in places such as schools, more populated work environments, and more people-oriented retail organizations, such as workplaces, workplaces where people are frequently exposed to COVID-19, workplaces where people need to be monitored, workplaces that need to be monitored, workplaces that need to be protected, workplaces that need to be protected, workplaces that need to be equipped with safety devices, workplaces that need to be set up for employees, workplaces, workplaces for employees, workplaces that are at risk, etc.
The staff in this high-risk group rarely require a respirator.
Proper restrictions to protect workers and other passengers, including, if a person becomes ill on the plane, separating the sick person from others by 6 feet, appointing a team member to serve the sick person, and providing a mask to the sick person or telling the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear single-use medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching surfaces where bodily fluids or potentially infected surfaces may be present. Additional personal protective equipment should also be worn if a sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other removable items should be stored and disposed of in a biological hazard bag, then the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected. Risk controls to be carried out on commercial vessels, including luxury ships and other passenger ships, if fever or other symptoms appear while on board, include postponing and self-isolation of travel if sick and immediately informing the medical center on board.
In general, a medical examination of an isolated person in a room should be conducted. In schools and child care facilities, regardless of the community transmission status, the CDC recommends that if an infected person was in a school building, the place be cleaned or disinfected for a short period of time.
In a stage of moderate or low community transmission, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as canceling field trips, gatherings and large gatherings such as physical education or singing group classes or dining in a restaurant, increasing the distance between tables, intermittent attendance and dissolution times, limiting unnecessary visitors and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
While there is considerable spread at the local community level, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school closures may be considered a strategy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers that for law enforcement personnel who perform daily routine activities, the level of immediate health risk is low.
Law enforcement officers who come into contact with people who have been confirmed or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 are also recommended to follow the same guidelines as are followed by emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during the seizure, the household used cleaning sprayer or wiper should be cleaned and disinfected before using the work cartridge and clothing, and follow the general procedure for reserving and removing personal protective equipment (PPE) used, reserving clothes and washing.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) classifies certain health and funeral workers as high or very high risk.
Health care, support, laboratory service providers and medical transport workers are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 in known or suspected cases.
It is considered to be highly contagious if staff members perform tasks such as collecting or handling samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The possible stages of sputum formation include ducting into the bronchi, coughing triggering procedures, pulmonary resuscitation, some dental procedures, and sample collection through investigations or perforation.
In high-exposure risk mortuary jobs, including workers involved in preparing the bodies of persons known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; these become very high exposure risk if an autopsy is performed. Additional engineering restrictions for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol-forming procedures are performed.
The provision of special negative pressure ventilation in some health and mortuary settings may be optimal.
Models should be handled following Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be kept in isolation waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 patients. For those who are known patients or suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2, wear a PPE (Phase Immunodeficiency Virus) that is less than 6 feet apart from other PPEs (Phase Immunodeficiation Equipment).
In the United States, NOIH-approved N95 filtration facepiece respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes eligibility-testing, training, and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators may provide more protection and may be more comfortable for staff to wear. WHO does not recommend full-wear as COVID-19 is not a respiratory disease but can be transmitted through bodily fluids.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that only personnel serving at the entry or exit point be provided with a face mask during surgery.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, gown and gloves for those who are collecting, caring for, or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without aerosol generating procedures.
In the case of sputum formation, N95 (N95) or FFP2 respirators are used instead of surgical masks.
Due to the inadequate global supply of personal protective equipment, physical barriers such as telemedicine, clear windows, allowing only those who engage in direct care to enter the room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the personal protective equipment required for that specific task, while maintaining multiple patients with the same diagnosis, continuing to use the same respirator without removing the personal protective equipment, monitoring the supply chain of personal protective equipment, and using a non-essential PPE.

We are in a unique situation this year.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the interconnectedness of the human race on a global scale and the responsibilities we have to discharge to each other.
We don't have a model for these challenges, but we know that the best response is to work at the heart of this organization for global empathy, cooperation and social infrastructure.
The friendliness and care we've seen among all of our co-workers through email, calls, and chats is a remarkable testimony to the fact that we've been fortunate to work with amazing people.
I can't be more grateful and proud to have you as my friend.
Last week, someone shared with me a tribute to our work.
I was reminded of how important it is that the world is now turning to Wikipedia for information, and that maintaining these important resources online is a powerful sign.
Whether it's keeping the sites up-to-date or giving money to our colleagues or helping our communities stay safe, it's your work that makes this possible.
Today's technology is more important to the world than ever before.
It's not just how we act, it's how we do it that makes a meaningful impact on the world.
Considering the importance of this work and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes in the way we work together from this week onwards.
Changes in our work and projects
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our approach and plans for the days and months to come.
In that conversation we discussed what we consider to be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to keep the company grounded at the moment.
We wanted to get rid of the stress and support our work for the long term.
If you want to reduce its intensity, do it well.
For all employees, contractors and contract labourers:
Our daily work is expected to be 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week.
We're not declaring a holiday - if you want to work longer than usual, this task will use you to the fullest.
However, right now the world is in an unpredictable state, you may want to be supportive of loved ones, want to go shopping for groceries or want to go to the doctor, but your well-being is our priority.
We don't control your time.
If you're sick, don't go to work.
We have to say it, but we have to say it.
No medical leave or PTO required <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Help your team edit calendars and action plans to ensure that key parts of the work are focused and report to your manager.
(If you are confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, please let Brian on T&C Ops know that T&C will provide you with the support you need and help ensure your status gets the proper attention of management).
Full payment will be made to the hourly employees.
As we have said before, we re-affirm to fulfill our promise to our contractors and large-scale employees to pay according to working hours.
All employees will be paid on the basis of normal working hours.
This means that you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use it as a way to cope with the stress of the world around us.
The work we do, especially in times like these, can bring unexpected results.
Again, it's about your own safety.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager so that we know what to expect and then be able to adjust accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
We have some work to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising Committees (among others) perform critical functions that require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to evaluate current objectives and shift our focus on supporting those that are essential to our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we are all focused on the most essential projects right now.
If it is delayed, the effect will be less.
"We do not plan to serve as a ""double time to catch the lost"" once the pandemic period is over."
There is no need to work extra hours to meet deadlines.
We accept that the environment has changed and will work to set new goals and timelines where appropriate.
What is APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to the new regime and the daily working hours, it is proposed to revise the timelines for the execution of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
"Our aim is to propose an expansion of the 2019-2020 programme, which, while accommodating those who need or want a reduced timetable, gives more time over the next few weeks to plan for prioritizing important work, self-care and caring for loved ones to employees," the statement said.
This extension of time greatly reduces the current planning workload and stress on the entire organization.
We will introduce our plan to the Executive Committee next week, and update on the next steps with representatives and committees as soon as confirmation is received.
Thank you to the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office Position, Possibilities for Infection and Cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our-colleagues from San Francisco had been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we cleaned up all surfaces in the San Francisco office with an anti-microbial sanitiser team to disinfect.
They used a hospital-grade virus-resistant compound to disinfect surfaces, the home room and elevators that access our site, etc.
The building maintains a moral or legal obligation to use products that ensure the safety of its residents.
When we decide to return to work, we are relieved to know that the office will be ready for us.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork and they have shared their COVID-19 related protocols with us and all DC related staff.
As of last week, our DC office was fully transitioned to a remote system in accordance with the shared guidance with San Francisco.
We are also discussing leasing a space in Brooklyn, as some of our New York City-based colleagues know.
These discussions are ongoing, but may be undertaken late.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-distance colleagues knew this was a fix and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to a maximum of one or two hour increments.
If necessary, they can be divided into sessions of several days.
Clearly define the need for the meeting, create an action plan, and forward the topics that need to be studied in advance.
Use tools like Google Docs and Zoom to make it easier to connect and connect with people.
One person to organize the meetings properly, one person to track the questions that arise during the chat and one person to track down the list of speakers and one person to help take notes (or take notes collectively).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need help.
Use the money to pay for the health care you receive.
Join the <0x23>Remotties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations Team is taking steps to undertake a webinar based ergonomics guidance to support the increased level of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we called on all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events such as editathons until the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the pandemic over.
We made them aware that depending on our request for cancellations and other restrictions it was impossible for them to complete the subsidy measures they had accepted and that no one would be penalized for any delay or alteration in reaching those goals.
We'll be following up with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and themed social conferences this week.
For the global community, the disruption has generally created distress rather than help clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, the Wikimedia Foundation and others.
CRT is in the process of setting up a page on Meta-Wiki for the community to help us keep track of the impact, take into account the future, and follow our communications.
Keeping abreast of COVID-19 related issues
On the following Thursday, at 14:00 UTC / 07:00 PT, we will send out an invitation to your calendars to participate in a special staff meeting.
You can use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time with each other.
We are here to help you, and we will do everything we can to help you.
In the meantime, you can get some information from this email and find all the essential COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT will update these pages from time to time to process all the information available in one place.
We also maintain regular communication with employees in countries that are currently experiencing significant outbreaks.
If you have questions about travel, events, a major workgroup or an insurance related challenge or need assistance, please do not hesitate to inform CRT and work together.
We are here to provide support and assistance.
If you have confidential or sensitive information, please email HR International Global Operations Director Brian Judon.
None of these changes should be seen as an act of abdication of our duty and responsibility.
On the contrary, they are a recognition that, at this moment, our mission and obligations will have to be altered in a way that has never been done before.
We believe that these steps are necessary to support each other as we continue to work, provide the support needed for our movement, and provide them with the service that the world looks forward to.
The work we have planned will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to be supportive of each other and for important work to come in a few weeks or possibly months.

B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines (in cell membranes).
ACE-2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the levels of angiotensin-II and increasing ang (1-7) making it a promising target drug for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE-2 acts as an entry point in cells for some CoVs.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as HACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an enzyme composed of zinc metal that is located on the surface of the invertebrate and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptides M2 site and the C-terminal collector's renal amino acid conduction site.
ACE2 is the first type of membrane protein to pass through once. The part of its enzyme-dependent performance is exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The peripheral domain of ACE2 is broken down from the ovary by another enzyme called shetase, resulting in the soluble protein being absorbed into the bloodstream and eventually excreted by urine.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme - 2 is present in most organs: Angiotensin-converting enzyme - 2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of the second type of pulmonary alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, endothelial cells of the artery and venous and soft muscle cells of the artery in most organs.
ACE2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression is found in the cerebral cortex, the stratum corneum, the spinal cord, and the brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE breaks down the angiotensin I hormone in vasoconstrict angiotensin II.
ACE2 breaks down carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and makes it in the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Arp-HrPal-Val-Val-Phe).
[Des-ARG9]-Bratkinin, ablin, neurotensin, dinorphine A and ghrelin among many other peptides may cause ACE2 rupture.
ACE2 also regulates the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6.A19, which ensures the distribution of proteins and large molecules in cells. This has been confirmed in heart disease, a disease that alters the development of the rare type of amino acid.
As a membrane protein, ACE2 acts as a key pathogen for certain pathogens, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (the pathogen that causes SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein to the enzyme domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells displaces both endocytosis and the virus and enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry step necessitates the enlarging of S protein by DMPRSS2, the serine protein decomposition of the server. A study is currently underway to determine whether the suppression can be therapeutic. This has led to the hypothesis that reduction of ACE2 in cells may help in fighting the disease.
However, several professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE suppressor and ARP treatment.
"A systematic review and mutation-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors is associated with a significant 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls""."
It also reduced the risk of pneumonia among high-risk patients, especially those at risk of stroke and heart failure, through treatment with ACE inhibitors.
"The use of ACE inhibitors reduces pneumonia-related mortality, although the results are weaker than the overall risk of pneumonia."""
Recombination Human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel treatment for acute lung injury, and appeared to improve lung blood concentration and oxygen saturation in pigs with acute respiratory tract syndrome induced by the cholesterol compound.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the effect lasts for an additional 24 hours (period) with 30 minutes of start-up time.
A number of findings suggest that RHACE2 may be a promising drug for classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) in people who have no tolerance to or angiotensin II-enhancing diseases. RHACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory tract syndrome.
"B'COVID-19 apps are a mobile phone software application designed to help detect contacts during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e., the process of identifying people (""contacts"") who may have been in contact with an infected individual."
A large number of apps have been developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for creating contact tracing apps have been improved.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, about systems based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Less invasive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will be integrating these Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 victims.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The app has been developed by the local IT community and will be released free of cost and handed over to the government.West Macedonia launched the Bluetooth-based app ""Stop Corona!"" which will track the exposure of infected persons and provide quick information to the health authorities."
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government said that the contact tracing app is in an advanced stage of development and will be rolled out within a few weeks and a similar app is planned in Ireland and France (""STOPCOVID"")."
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceGetter app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to launch the geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow, designed to keep infected people from leaving home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems in app-based systems, including false positives and its efficacy being low if the use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
"To address concerns about the spread of false or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its app store, allowing only ""official"" or reputable companies."
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Campaigners for individual rights expressed concern over the impact of mass surveillance using the CoronaVirus app, particularly on the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the pandemic and whether the disease threat will be removed once it is under control.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
The companies announced eight conditions in the government schemes:
(a) to ensure that there is a fair, adequate, and reasonable rate of return;
Extensions of surveillance and monitoring should have sunset provisions;
The use of the data is solely for purposes of COVID-19;
Data protection and anonymity must be protected and based on evidence;
The increase in discrimination and marginalization should be avoided through digital surveillance;
the right to share data with third parties;
Citizens should have the right to defend themselves against ostracism and to face ostracism;
"A meaningful participation of all ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health professionals and marginalized groups will be required. The German Gays Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter One Grensen) (RSF) also published checklists."
Google/Apple wants to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism from their device operating systems if the tracking mechanism is not continuously required in the proposed Google/Apple project.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to bypass monitoring.
In Israel, network-based monitoring is approved.
There are significant possibilities that network-based solutions that access source location data may have privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location information; many privacy-protecting systems have been developed that only use central servers for contacts (see the section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to identify people who might have come into contact with an infected person.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and aggregates this information and sends it through SMS to vulnerable individuals.
This information is used to alert potential contacts and the government has made location information available to the public, which has been made possible by the vast changes in privacy laws in that country since MERS began to spread.
This information is made available to the public via multiple apps and websites. Countries including Germany are considered to be using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is a well-established concept that has been in the research literature since about 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on friendly-privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to send user proximity statuses to other handsets.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that consists of centralized and decentralized approaches, not a protocol. Decentralized protocols include TCP-PPT/DB-3D to detect possible contacts in the vicinity of the decentralized privacy-protection protocol, temporary contact numbers (TCN, FKA contact event numbers, and CEN algorithms for detecting mobile, FKA contact event numbers, and CEN protocols.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data, never leaves the device, and all matches take place on the device itself.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy-protecting techniques, when collecting and using location or route media information to track the spread of COVID-19.
"This is based on research published in March 2020 by White Paper ""Research by Apps Khan Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic""."
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and authorities, without compromising the privacy of that information.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN-Coalition was established by cohesive groups with a single approach and often overlapping protocols, with the aim of narrowing the scope slightly, enabling the global platform to detect and alert applications, as a key to achieving widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government made public its official BlueTrace protocol, which is used by the government of Singapore.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an effort to identify the contact person based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also released the specifications of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system will be rolled out in three stages:
Tools have been developed to help governments develop an app that detects potential contacts in order to protect against the official secret-coronavirus
In order to integrate this functionality directly with iOS, Android, Google, and Apple, it is planned to first take over the system by distributing operating system updates and solve persistent monitoring problems, and then remove it in the same way if the threat passes.
B' drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-employment, or therapeutic switching) is the repurposing of an approved drug to treat a different disease or medical condition than was originally developed.
It is part of scientific research and is currently being used to continuously develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research methods include the discovery of a COVID-19 vaccine and lymphatic exchange to relieve the disease. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug proteins, each with multiple muscular binding bases.
Inspecting those binding sites provides a reasonable plan for developing an effective viral vaccine against the COVID-19 protein.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include Papen-like proteases, RNA-based ribosomes (RNA-RNA) polymerases, helicases, S protein and ATP ribophosphates.
Husain AA, et al. studied a number of study compounds and then optimized their basic similarity with the highest level of approval with approved drugs. This was undertaken to accelerate the development of a powerful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in his preclinical study to be prescribed in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, is also used against certain diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of a unified clinical trial.
New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin in New York State on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved under the European Union (EUA) to be carried out as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
"The CDC has said that the ""use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection"" has not yet been established."
"""There is no other way,"" the doctors said, adding that they were using the drug."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen showed that Favipiravir showed ""clear benefit""."
In Shenzhen, 35 patients were diagnosed with no symptoms for an average of 4 days, while 45 patients had symptoms for 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan, half of 240 patients with pneumonia were given favipiravir and half received emifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical company reminded people that the current evidence to support the drug is scanty and prima facie insufficient.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its presence and use the military to supply those drugs to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has told the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug.
It is not safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
"A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) concluded that a combination of antivirals such as lopinavir and ritonavir ""does not yield any benefit""."
These drugs are designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to change drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. Criticisms exist within the scientific community about directing resources to reuse drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has included lopinavir/ritonavir in its International Solidarity Trial.
Remdesivir was developed and improved by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in a number of filo-, pneumo-, paramexo- and objectively against coronaviruses.
The problem with antiviral therapy is the formation of resistance through mutations, which can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early preclinical studies suggest that Remdesivir may have a higher genetic barrier to drug resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two clinical trials being conducted by Cleveland University hospitals; one for those with mild disease and the other for those with severe disease.
Three clinical trials of vitamin C, which is injected into people severely ill with COVID-19 who are hospitalized and intravenously, are being conducted; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one non-controlled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for the inhaled corticosteroid degenin alvesco (cyclezoneide) for asthma, which could be used to treat pre-symptomatic patients infected with novel coronavirus.
A Phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria to select 200 patients from patients with severe cases of hospitalization to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, titled "COLCORONA," looked at 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms without hospitalisation.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraceptive method are ineligible.
Several blood clotting inhibitors are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, due to which the Italian Medicines Agency has issued guidelines on its use.
A multidisciplinary study on 300 patients studied using Enoxaber's sodium in doses needed for prophylaxis and treatment was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen, there has been much scientific focus on repurposing approved anti-viral drugs developed for earlier unforeseen diseases such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to China’s 7th study
Umifenovir: Umifenovir recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to China’s 7th study
Some of the antibiotics identified as repurposed for COVID-19 treatment are:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Tests also in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab<0x23>COVID-19.
The Beta A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was not expected to be available within 18 months.
In the first phase of safety studies in April, there were five experimental vaccines.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A severe outbreak of the disease occurred around the world in 2020, leading to substantial investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Several companies are already using published genes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, CEPI noted that speed, productivity, large-scale implementation and global access are imperative for vaccine development initiatives.
In April, scientists at the CEPI said that there were 10 different technology research platforms and there was progress on that in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main basic objectives advanced in Phase I safety studies are as follows:
Carbohydrates (DNA and RNA) (First Phase Development and Vaccine Research: Moderna, messenger RNA - mRNA-1273)
Microbial carrier (Phase I developer and immunizer: Cansino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 carrier)
As announced by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 active projects confirmed (79 according to data from the Milken Institute), and 37 others have made announcements, but public information is available only in small quantities (think planning or designing).
The Phase I-II trial will conduct randomized, non-drug controlled, and multi-stage preliminary safety and immunogenicity trials, which will determine the most accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and include monitoring of the trial effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent disease, as well as the adverse effects caused by doses of the drug given at optimal doses.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as early as April 2020), 74 were still not involved in the human evaluation study (still under ""preclinical"" research)."
In Australia, the University of Queensland announced on 24 January 2020 that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to trigger an immune response.

development and production of vaccines.
The partners have also announced plans to begin pre-pharmacy trials and phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, India's Health Ministry announced that 11 dedicated efforts are underway to develop a vaccine and that it could take one-and-a-half to two years to develop a vaccine, even if it is done at a rapid pace.
On 12 March 2020, Medicaco, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, announced that it would partially fund Canadian institutions for health research for particle development, such as the coronavirus.
The vaccine is in laboratory research and human trials are scheduled to take place in July or August 2020.
"Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had paid ""a large sum of money"" for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine to Curvec, to which the German government objected."

On 17 March 2020, the company announced that it would be giving the results of their clinical trials in April 2020, and they could start testing on humans with the vaccine.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) comprising Pasteur University, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium.
Other investment partners of CEPI include: Moderna, Keurweg, Innovaio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had begun animal trials of six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-enhancing RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of contact with China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including vaccine discovery efforts at Canadian institutions and universities, including the University of Medico and Saskatchewan.
"Approximately at the same time, the Canadian government announced 192 million Canadian dollars for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, which it plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" comprising several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus impact."
"On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine said they had tested a potential COVID-19 vaccine called BitCovac on mice, and that ""the SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine, provided by MNA, begins to show clear antiviral effects [in mice] after two weeks of exposure to potent specific antigens."
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy in Canada announced that it was designing a DNA-based vaccine nasal spray.
Using antibiotics, this DNA is designed to form harmless pathogen-like particles inside human bacteria that may trigger the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources from IBM to access supercomputers, along with the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have side effects that are also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit from prevention.
More random testing in Australia is trying to recruit 4,170 health care workers.
Vaccines are unlikely to be safe or effective.
Preliminary research to assess vaccine efficacy using coronavirus COVID-19-specific animal models, such as mutant rats, other laboratory animals and non-human animals, indicates the need for biosafety level 3 control measures and international coordination to deal with live pathogens to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or safety vaccine for SARS that has been proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research articles published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
While MERS was widely prevalent, it is believed that existing SARS research may provide an effective template for developing vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and there are three ongoing trials, all of which involve virus-borne vaccines, two adenovirus-borne vaccines (ChAdOx1-Mers, PVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-CoV-Me.
Social media posts promote conspiracy theories that state that the virus behind COVID-19 has been detected and that a vaccine for it already exists.
Patents cited by various social media posts refer to patents for genetic sequencing and vaccines for other strains of the coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV.
B'Corona disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
It usually takes five days for the first symptom to appear from the onset of the infection, but it can range from two days to fourteen days.
While most infections cause mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and polycystic ovary syndrome.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly through close contact between humans, usually through small droplets emitted by coughing, sneezing, or talking.
These flaps are formed when the air is exhaled, and they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than being infected over long distances.
People can be infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching the infected surface.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although it is possible to spread before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease. The standard method for diagnosis is a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal puncture.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by the general public vary, with some officials recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most of the six regions of the WHO.
People infected with this virus may have no symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty getting up, and a blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Rarely, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been seen in varying percentages.
Some cases in China were initially only associated with chest tightness and palpitations.
In some patients, the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ dysfunction, and even death.
This is called the incubation period (the time between symptoms of the disease).
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of those who develop symptoms develop the disease within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission is not yet fully understood, and preliminary evidence suggests they may also contribute to disease transmission.
The proportion of people who remain asymptomatic despite infection is currently unknown and is under study, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of those infected had no symptoms at the time of admission to hospital.
China's National Health Commission began adding asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both the flu and the flu carry a large number of viruses.
The sound of the voice is louder than normal.
Studies have found that even when left unattended, drops can travel as far as 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bio-aerosol transmission may be possible, although the virus is not commonly learned and transmitted, and air collectors stationed in the hall outside people's rooms provided samples favorable to viral RNA.
The bronchial glands can be sprayed through certain medical procedures, such as pulmonary infusion and cardiopulmonary respirators (CPR), resulting in the spread of the virus into the air.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, this risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; the risk is low even though transmission is possible before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three others, with the virus surviving on surfaces for hours to several days.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive for one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AIS 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this will vary depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and washing powder are also effective if used correctly; soap products break down the fat protective layer of the pathogen, inactivate it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken an average of two days after hospitalization.
For five of the six patients, the first sample showed more viruses, and the sixth patient showed more viruses on the second day after being tested.
The most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel most severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated in Wuhan in three individuals with pneumonia associated with acute respiratory cluster disease.
All aspects of CoVs in nature occur in the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus as well.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which explodes its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The organs most affected by COVID-19 are the lungs, as the virus accesses host cells via an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a unique exogenous glycoprotein called "peplomer" to interact with ACE2 and enter another cell.
In Wuhan, China, 12% of hospitalized victims were diagnosed with severe heart disease, and it is frequently seen in severe illnesses.
Rates of cardiac symptoms are higher during disease progression due to organ anti-inflammatory activity and immune system disorders, but severe heart attack may also be related to the ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are more expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
In the intensive care unit (ICU) patients with COVID-19 infection, an increased incidence of vascular thrombosis (thrombosis 31%) and venous thrombolysis (venous thrombolysis 25%) has been observed, and may be associated with a worsening prognosis.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has an induction relativism to ACE2-expressed epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have organoprophylaxis symptoms.
In particular, GM-CSF, which secretes T-cells and causes disease, has been shown to be associated with the occurrence of single cell secretion IL-6 inflammation and acute lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Intrusions into lymphatic cells have been reported in the post-mortem.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has published a number of diagnostic criteria for the disease.
The standard method for testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR).
Typically, the test is performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nesopharyngeal swab; however, a nasal swab or swab sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and release the genome sequence so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which may detect existing infections and find out if a person has had an infection in the past) were in progress but are not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience shows that the accuracy is only 60% to 70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first point-of-care test for use at the end of that month on 21 March 2020. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan University, suggested mechanisms for detecting infections based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multiple floor-glass opacity with external, asymmetric and posterior distribution is common in early infection.
There may be dominance of pleural effusion, slurry breathing (thickening of the fascia wall with varying tubule fillers), and strengthening during disease progression.
There is some information available about microscopic lesions and the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of autopsy are:
Physiological examination: Pulmonary mucosa, Pulmonary Inflammation, Pulmonary hardening and Pulmonary Inflammation
Four types of acute viral pneumonia can be observed:
Mild Pneumonia: Lung inflammation, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large variety of pneumocytes, medial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration, and multinuclear giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAT) with diffuse alveolar leaks.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe blood loss (DAD) are caused by DAD.
Cure Pneumonia: Structure of alveolar pits and leaks in pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: Widespread blood coagulation (DIC); white blood cell increase reaction
The preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, frequent washing of hands with soap and water and washing of hands for at least 20 seconds, adhering to good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a dish when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the interior of the elbow if no dish is available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
In order to control the spread by asymptomatic persons, the CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places.The social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing contact of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include that people should stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No drug has been shown to be effective in preventing COVID-19. The key component in managing COVID-19 is slowing down the peak of the pandemic as a vaccine is not expected until 2021 as soon as possible.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are dirty, before eating and after rinsing one’s nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the World Health Organization offers two formulas for local production.
In these formulations, the anti-microbial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is ""not an active substance for hand antiseptics""."
Glycerol is added as a moisturiser.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygenation, and supportive of other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxidation (ECMO), was used to solve the problem of breathing disorder, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supplemental therapies can be effective in people with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection.The World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China have issued recommendations for taking care of those hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care specialists and pulmonologists in the United States have compiled treatment recommendations from various institutions in a free resource called the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the spread of the virus, especially during procedures where health systems can release droplets, such as pipe fittings or the use of a hand-operated breathing apparatus.
In addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne transmission precautions for healthcare professionals caring for those with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing a person in an airborne-borne infection isolation room (AIIR) in order to provide guidance for the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Suggested tools: PPE coveralls, respirators or masks, eye protections, and medical gloves. respirators (instead of a mask) are recommended if available.
N95 respirators have been approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but are not guaranteed about efficacy against the specific biological agent as an unauthorized use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using masks or, last but not least, using homemade masks.
Most COVID-19 patients do not have a serious condition that requires artificial respiration or alternatives, but a certain percentage do.
The type of respiratory support for people with COVID-19-related breathing disorders is being actively studied with some evidence that people in hospital may avoid inhalation with high flow nasal cannula or two-stage positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether these two drugs provide similar benefits to those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer invasive mechanical ventilation when available, as this technology limits the spread of erythrocyte particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Severe infection is most commonly seen in the elderly (people over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the capacity of health systems to handle rapidly rising numbers of COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required ventilation mechanical assistance, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Artificial respirators with pressure control systems and high PEEP capability are required to reduce the risk of ventilation-related lung injury and pneumothorax and increase oxygen supply.
High B.E.E.P. may go without on old ventilators
The study of potential treatments began in January 2020, and various antiviral drugs are in clinical trial.
Remdesivir seems to be very reliable.
While it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tried in severe patients.
Volunteers who are recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) participate in performance and safety tests of potential treatment. The FDA has granted provisional authorisation to sterilized feces as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the spread of the disease
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app uses surveillance data to detect the presence of close contact and thereby detect the possibility of infection.
Each user can also check the status of the other three users.
The app not only recommends self-isolation but also alerts local health authorities if potential risk is detected.Mobile data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location detection and artificial intelligence can help detect infected humans and track their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government helped security agencies keep track of mobile phone data of people who are said to have the coronavirus.
The move was taken to implement quarantine and protect those who could come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared unified phone location data with the German central government agency Robert Koch Institute to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia is using facial recognition technology to identify violators of quarantine.
"Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said he had been told by phone service providers that ""40 percent of the population is constantly moving around""."
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Gersty Kalijhulaid, has called for a solution from around the world to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience pain from isolation, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of infection.
The BBC's Rory O'Connor noted that "increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic fallout are the perfect storm to harm people's mental and physical health."
The disease may take a moderate course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as common cold.
Mild cases usually heal within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illnesses may take three to six weeks to heal.
The risk of severe infection of COVID-19 in pregnant women is likely to be higher based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is limited. In some individuals, COVID-19 can infect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
COVID-19 can rapidly progress to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (ARDS) in those with severe infection, causing respiratory failure, conjunctivitis trauma, or multi-organ failure.
Issues associated with COVID-19 include blood poisoning, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Unusual clots, particularly an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function has been seen in 4% of these patients.
About 20-30% of those who come in with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the appearance of symptoms and death is ten days, including five days spent in hospital.
However, there is an average of seven days between hospitalization and death for patients transferred to the ICU.
In the initial case study, the average duration from showing early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men is 2.8% and that of women is 1.7%.
Post-mortem histopathological examinations of the lung samples show multiple lesions that can spread with cellular fibromyxoid leakage in both lungs.
There have been changes in the immune system caused by viruses.
The picture of the lungs resembled that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
According to a report by China's National Health Commission, 11.8% of the deaths saw an increase in troponin levels and cardiovascular disease, including heart attack.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing illnesses, and the availability of medical resources and the socioeconomic condition of a region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary from this position due to those regional differences, but also due to systemic complications.
Not taking into account the mild cases would result in an overabundance of mortality.
However, the fact that there have been deaths as a result of morbidity in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about the long-term continuation of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found that some people who have recovered from the disease have had their lung capacity reduced by 20% to 30%, and lung x-rays suggested organ damage.
This can lead to post-intensity post-treatment syndrome following recovery.
As of March 2020, it is not known whether the vaccine provides effective and long-term immunity to people who recover from past infections.
Immunization has been seen to be possible based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but it has been reported that people who have recovered from COVID-19 have received positive tests for the coronavirus at a later date.
It is believed that these patients are more likely to have a worsening of the chronic infection than are those who are re-infected.
The virus is considered to be natural and originated from an animal through direct infection.
The true origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely human-to-human.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020, the initial date of onset of symptoms was revealed to be 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the World Health Organization (WHO) reported early symptoms on 8 December 2019.
A variety of methods are used to estimate mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time period, and are influenced by demographic characteristics such as test size, quality of health system, treatment choices, time from initial infection to onset, and age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 codes U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from COVID-19 detected clinically or epidemiologically without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proportion of deaths and disease outbreaks detected at a given interval was
According to Johns Hopkins University data, the global case fatality rate stood at 6.9% (1,53,822/2,24,0191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include Case Fatality Rate (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons dying from a disease and Infection Mortality Rate (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected persons (detected and undetected) who die from the disease.
These figures are undetermined and follow a specific group of people who have been infected by the pathogen.
While not all affected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
At least 4,60,080 (1.7%) people have already died in the small village of Castigli<0xC3><0xB3>n de Ada, at the centre of Italy's outbreak.
In Kenglet, the disease was spread by carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths were formally classified.
The healthcare system in Germany is not very good.
In the Netherlands, an estimated 3% of people who donate blood may have antibodies.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The incidence and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown a higher mortality rate in men.
For men, the risk is higher when they are in their 50s, while the gap between men and women is closer to the 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact reasons for this gender-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immune differences, less smoking in women, and the development of morbid conditions such as high blood pressure at a younger age in men than in women may account for the higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected people are men and 72% of those who have died with COVID-19 are men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not track sexual-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a high risk of contracting the virus.
"The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease was ""COVID-19""."
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for coronavirus, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease, and 19 stands for 31 December 2019, when the outbreak was first identified.
The name is named in accordance with the international recommendation to prevent the naming of a specific territory (e.g. China), animal, or group of people, with the intention of causing stigma. The COVID-19-causing virus has been named SARS-CoV-2, the most severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO additionally uses ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""virus responsible for COVID-19"" in public communications."
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as the "coronavirus."
The virus and the disease were both commonly referred to as the "coronavirus" and the "Wuhan coronavirus" during the early outbreak in Wuhan, China.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the names 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV Severe Acute Respiratory Illness as interim names for the virus and disease, according to a 2015 guideline against using place names for disease and pathogens.
The official names, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2, were released on February 11, 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in common supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health products such as nasal swabs and artificial respirators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve but the provider was unable to provide the required amount of time, a local start-up company re-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and distorted information about the origin, magnitude, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the internet.
Humans seem to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals as well.
The study failed to find evidence of viral transmissibility in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicine or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of this disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being carried out by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a ""solidity trial"" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four well-acting antiviral compounds based on their current efficacy."
There are currently no vaccines, but several companies are actively developing vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV has been used, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use an ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete viral vaccine.
The use of such a pathogen, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to elicit the human body's immune response against the new infection of COVID-19.
The second strategy, sub-stage vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain subgroups of the virus.
For SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (deoxyribonucleic (DNA) or RNA vaccines, a modern technique for making vaccines).
The experimental vaccines from which these strategies are derived should be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing pathogen. Immunogenic material enhancement is recommended as a potential challenge in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2, but this is debatable.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials underway.
Seven trials are evaluating treatments for already approved malaria, including four trials on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Chinese studies have largely focused on antiviral drugs, with the results of nine Phase III trials on Remdesivir expected by the end of April.
The dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug contributors was in force till April 2020. Existing viral vaccines are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ridonavir and Ritonavir combined with Lopinavir/Interferon Beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir.
Clinical progress was seen in patients who had not yet been approved for remdesivir treatment.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for a collaborative re-evaluation of the research.
Korean and Chinese health officials recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that it is twice as dangerous and potentially life-threatening.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. China's 7th edition guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or Umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Initial data suggest that high levels of ribavirin are necessary to objectively prevent SARS-CoV-2.
Further nitazoxanide has been recommended in the vivo study after having demonstrated low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have demonstrated that initial spike protein priming, by transmembrane protease serine 2 (DMPRSS2), is necessary for entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interacting with an ACE2 receptor.
Studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, with or without azithromycin, are highly limited and prevent the medical world from accepting them without further studies. Oseltamivir does not objectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab is included in China's National Health Commission's treatment guidelines based on a small study result.
After showing positive results in those with severe disease, it has undergone a 2-stage non-spontaneous trial at the national level in Italy.
Together with Serum Ferritin's blood test to identify cytokine stormes, it is to deal with some such breakthroughs that are considered to be responsible for the death of some infected people.
In 2017, the FDA approved interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on post-infection studies on the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome, another cause-induced steroidally induced cytokine release syndrome called CART cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified and enriched antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccinated method of alternative immunization.
This strategy was tried out for Sars with inconclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive anti-protein therapy can mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms such as counter-protein-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis are possible.
Other forms of passive antiretroviral therapy, such as the use of prepared ornithological antibodies, are in progress.
The production of convalescent fecal water containing the fluid portion of the blood taken from recovered patients and the specific immunosuppressant for this virus can be increased for rapid application.
Coronary diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan's central hospital, died of Covid-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
