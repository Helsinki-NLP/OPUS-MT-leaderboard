Welsh AMs worried about 'what looks like Muppets'
Some AMs were shocked at the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is that the Parliament has become the House of Commons.
All the political parties are worried that this will lead to ridicule.
“It’s like Twp and Pwp,” said one labor AM.
For readers outside of Wales: twp in Welsh means low intellect and pwp means feces.
A Plaid AM said that the whole of our class was “not happy” and they suggested some alternatives.
We are "positive" about the name change, but one Welsh Conservative says that MWP is an indicator for Muppet.
In this case, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting the name change law, said: "The final decision on how to summon members of the Assembly is in the hands of the members."
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of its poll, according to which a majority of the population supported the name Welsh Parliament for the Assembly.
The Commission on A.M.'s title favours Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the majority of the public support MWP.
AMs suggested alternative names, but it became a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who was required to submit draft legislation for changes within a few weeks, to reach a consensus from everyone.
The Reforms Act also included disqualification of AMs and other changes relating to the functioning of the Assembly along with the Committee System Design Rules.
They have the right to ultimately vote on how the AMs should be called when there is a discussion on the Act.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
The vote is aimed at finding a solution to a decades-long conflict with Macedonia, which is located in neighboring Greece.
Athens has long been concerned that its neighbor to the north is attempting to occupy an area of their country based on their name, for which reason it is being blocked from becoming a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georg Ivanov, who is opposed to the name change referendum, said he would not consider the vote.
However, those supporting the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Jeev, say the name change will allow them to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells go silent as churches in Harlem are struggling
"The elders who spoke to me told me that, according to history, at every turn, there was a bar and a church," Adams said.
But today, they're not."
He said he understands the pitfalls.
He said: "People's lives have changed.
"People don't often go to bars these days."
When it comes to churches, leaders can't spend as much time with the money that comes from selling off assets as they think, "Very soon things will come back to the top," he said.
Because of the demolition of churches and the construction of large buildings, people who enter its apartments may overlook the sacred sites that surround them.
"The apartments in these buildings are mostly bought by white people," he said, "and since most of those who come into these apartments are not members of churches, the day is near when all these churches will be closed."
The two churches were built by whites before Harlem became a black metropolis <0xE2><0x80><0x93> a decade after St. Martin became a metropolitan community in 1870.
In the 1930s, the original white Methodist group moved out.
The black people who were praying in the temple were also buried there.
Under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, the Blacks took control of St. Martin and began a campaign on Main Street, 125th Street in Harlem to ban retailers who refused to recruit Blacks or hold high positions.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, so Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carillon to be rebuilt.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson, heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert who rang the carillon in July added: "Cultural wealth" and "unparalleled historical instrument."
According to Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, this was the first carillon played by a black musician, named Diana A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Meriwether said no one else was appointed in his place at St. Martin's Church.
For the past few months, St. Martin has been hearing only the voices of architects and contractors, some of whom were brought in by lay leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Vestry, the parish oversight body that met with le leaders about the diocese, wrote in July of their concerns, saying that the diocese was trying to "recover costs" from them despite their lack of involvement in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some people have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy has been injured by a shark while hunting lobsters in California
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark when he went to catch lobsters on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Beacons Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel, who spoke to KSWB-TV, said he heard someone screaming for help in San Diego on Saturday morning after swimming with friends for about half an hour, and then went out with the group to rescue the boy from the water.
Hamel said, "At first we thought they were shouting in the joy of holding the lobster, but then we realized they were shouting, 'Burn me!,'"
I'm done with you!'
When I got to him, he was gone, and he was gone, and he was gone."
"Everyone come out of the water," said Hamel, "and I shouted: 'There's a shark in the water!'
The boy was airlifted to Reedy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where doctors said his condition was critical.
It is not known which nation the attack belonged to.
Life Guard Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but that it was harmless and did not breed.
The boy had survived the severe injuries sustained in the upper part of the torso, said Giles.
Authorities shut down the Panto beach in Casablanca for 48 hours, preventing the Swamis from entering the Encinitas for interrogation and security purposes.
There are about 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are harmless, Giles said.
The company plans to enter the UK market
Sainsbury wants to set up department store-like beauty salons in Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams that have specialized assistants.
Fashion and homeware sales are falling in the UK beauty market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, so the company plans to open a massive beauty store in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, in more stores next year.
Supermarkets want to invest in things like TVs, microwaves and homewares.
Sainsbury said that for the first time, it is doubling its beauty services with nearly 3000 products from brands such as Revlon, SC, Tweezer Man and Dr. Papa.
Brands like Boots, L'Or<0xC3><0xA9>al, Maybeline and Burt's Bees will also get more space.
The supermarket also wants to re-launch its boutique makeup services so that more and more young people can have as much of the vegan products offered to them as they want.
Similarly, Fragrances, a retailer selling perfume, wants to offer discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second will open in Celly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Supermarkets have to put in a lot of efforts to keep customers going due to low volume of food purchases in online shopping and convenience stores on a daily basis.
The outlets will grow like department stores as part of efforts to chain supermarkets to deal with those selling more services and non-food products at reduced prices, said Mike Kopp, chief executive of Sainsburys.
Sainsbury's is setting up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as introducing several Hobbits, as the two chains were purchased two years ago, strengthening Grocery sales and helping make purchases more profitable.
An earlier attempt by the supermarket to revive its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury and Boots started a joint venture, but the relationship ended due to problems with sharing proceeds from the chemists in his supermarkets.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's launched a new strategy after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Celicio, owner of the Liad's Pharmacy chain, for a price of <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
Liads will also participate in the plan by offering four stores, including La Roch-Poche and Vichy, as well as expensive skincare brands.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely transformed the look and feel of our beauty salons to provide a new environment for our customers.
We have specially trained and invested for co-workers, who provide advice.
"We are now offering a brand new beauty service, challenging the old way of shopping by setting up our brands in a way that meets all needs and is available in beautiful and comfortable locations."
Peter Jones has been 'overwhelming' after Holly Willoughby walked out of the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Willaby, a TV presenter, has pulled out of an <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Dragons' Den star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on Marks and Spencer and the new contracts he has forged with ITV, leaving Peter "angry."
There's no time at Villaby for Trulli, the brand of their homeware and accessories.
There is a similarity between the couple's business to Gineth Paltro's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old announced his departure on Instagram.
To focus on Marx and Spencer and the new contracts he had with ITV, Holly Willabie pulled him out of a lucrative deal with Dragon's Den star Peter Jones' lifestyle brand business.
According to reliable sources, he was "angry" at Tuesday's key meeting at the Marlowe Jones business empire's headquarters in Buckinghamshire when Willabi, a golden girl on TV, was told he would not be able to devote time to Trully, his homeware and accessory brand, due to his new deals worth nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The business is similar to Gineth Paltrow's Goop brand and is estimated to be more than double Willaby's nearly <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Willaby, 37, announced his departure on Instagram while Jones traveled to one of his favorite holiday destinations, Britain.
According to sources, "True love is the most important of Holi's priorities.
This will have a long-term impact over the next two years.
Everyone was surprised to hear of her death.
No one could have predicted the magnitude of Tuesday's events, as it was about to be released very soon.
The warehouse at Marlowe headquarters is full of items that are ready for sale."
According to experts, due to the departure of this morning presenter, which is the most popular star in Britain, the company that has invested heavily in all products from cushions, candles to clothing and homeware, could suffer losses in the millions and the release could also be further delayed.
It can also lead to a long-lasting friendship.
Willabee, a mother of three children, and her husband, Don Baldwin, and Jones, his wife, Tara Cap, have been close friends for over ten years.
Willaby, along with Cap, founded Truele in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the board as chairman in March.
The couple spent the holidays together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willaby will now be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant MacPartlin as host on I'm the Celebrity on ITV.
"We don't comment on his business dealings," those who were close to Jones said last night.
Wesley whispered, "We're in love."
Trump has joked about the criticism he may receive from news outlets, as many consider his very positive remarks about the North Korean president to be "not appropriate for the president."
Why is President Trump so irresponsible?
He was talking to the "Yankees."
"I didn't get anything."
Trump said Kim was "extremely interested" in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, and that it was a "very good step" toward reducing nuclear weapons in North Korea.
The nuclear talks have stalled.
Nearly three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea has not received a "fair response" about the first denuclearization actions by the U.N., the leading envoy to the U.N. General Assembly said.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions to increase pressure on them.
Trump doesn't speak very loudly.
"We're doing very well on North Korea," he said.
"We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of lives were lost.
We have a good relationship now."
"My efforts to establish a positive relationship with Kim have paid off, as a result of which, rocket tests have been stopped, aid in the release of hostages and the last vestiges of American soldiers are about to be repatriated," he said.
He has made remarkable progress in his relationship with Kim.
"It's easier to send 10,000 people to small areas like normal presidents, but now we've got 200," Trump said.
Indonesia earthquake, tsunami: Death toll rises to 10, hundreds injured
For example, according to the developments in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, they claimed that they did not need the help of foreign charities.
About 10 percent of Lombok's population has become homeless, although it has not been declared a national disaster, but international aid is essential.
"Unfortunately, in most cases, they make it clear that they don't need their international help," Sambung said.
Seve the Children is preparing a team for their move to Palu, but it's not yet certain whether the aliens will be able to go there.
Indonesian authorities are assessing the local situation to determine whether or not to allow international aid into Palu, a spokesman for the national disaster agency said.
Earthquakes occur frequently in Indonesia, but there are no adequate measures to cope with natural disasters.
ASELO Tsunami Rehabilitation Centers were built, but nothing similar is seen in other coastal areas.
There was no tsunami warning siren in Palu even at the time of issuance of warnings, due to which also loss of life was caused.
Travelling to many of the islands in Indonesia is a big challenge even when all is well.
Transportation becomes more difficult due to natural disasters.
The hospital ship, which was set up in Lombok to treat earthquake victims, is now leaving for Palu to treat victims in the new disaster area, but it will take at least three days to reach there.
President Joko Widodo, in his so-called dream campaign, promised to fix Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But due to a lack of funds, Joko's administration was in crisis, and he subsequently ran for re-election the following year.
Joko is under pressure from religious fanatics based on the religious superstitious beliefs of the vast majority of Muslims in Indonesia.
Over 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were left homeless as Christians and Muslims waged street battles in heavy swords, darts and other deadly weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge ruled out of Chelsea's match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute of the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
When Sturridge was trailing 1-0, 30 yards away from Chelsea goal, he received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri.
He once tapped the ball to the left before kicking the ball into the post at a distance.
This resulted in the ball tilting to the top right corner of the net.
The cat finally got over the fence and went into the house.
“It’s important to get into that position, and then players like Shock deliver the ball to the forward as much as possible, so I tried to keep it as long as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"But I saw what was coming, and I taped it without thinking too much, and then I shot straight up."
Chelsea lead 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
During the game, the blues striker passed back to Matteo Kovacic before he was half-spinned in the field and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly tried to give-and-go while in the half-field.
He then hit a beautiful throw ball so that Hazard was able to score the goal.
The ball went straight into the net as Hazard broke all the barriers and hit the back of the left-footed Liverpool player Alison Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Napoli will be played at 3 pm on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, as part of the Champions League group stage.
The match between Chelsea and Videoton will be played in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami and earthquake has risen to 832, the national disaster agency said Sunday morning.
The agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nurgoho said at a press conference that many people were trapped under collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday and a wave of up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, which is home to more than 380,000 people, currently has ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man in connection with the case
Police launched a murder investigation after the body of a Birkenhead woman was found in Merseyside this morning.
The body of a 44-year-old woman, who died as a result of stab wounds, was found at Grayson Mivs on John Street at around 7.55am, after a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have appealed to the public to tell them if they have seen or heard anything related to the incident.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, and anyone around John Street in Birkenhead who has heard or seen anything about the incident should contact us immediately.
I appeal to all, especially if there is any record in the dashcam of taxi drivers, let us know immediately, which is very crucial for our investigation.’
The representative of the authority of the police confirmed that the deceased Mahisha would be a resident of the locality and her dead body was found in a courtyard.
Some of the friends, who thought they might be in contact with the woman, came to the spot this afternoon and asked where the body was found.
As part of the investigation, the police informed the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to get into his house, but the police were not allowing anyone in or out of the building.
He did not speak about the incident.
Police say it will take a few more hours for everyone to be released.
Police said the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman standing there.
Again, this is "too bad."
At about 2 p.m. two police vehicles came inside the cordon while one vehicle remained outside.
A lot of people are looking at the cards in the deck.
Anyone with information is asked to call DM <0x40>MerPolCC, 101, or call Crime Stoppers 0800 555 111 for help or to be anonymous and tell them that the log is 247 for September 30.
The statue of Cramwell in Parliament has been embroiled in a controversy over its recent rewriting of history
The poetic justice was to demolish the statue of Crumwell, who had demolished the culture and religious structures of England with the help of his Puritan followers such as the Manmads and had behaved like the Taliban.
But the Crumwell Society called the suggestion "foolish" and an attempt to "rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cramwell Society, said: "Due to ongoing statue removal negotiations, it is inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cramwell will be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell neither ordered the removal of the statues as part of the English Civil Wars nor did he participate in it.
Perhaps Cromwell was wrongfully reinforcing the wrongs committed by his ancestor Thomas in the century before him.
Sir William Hama Thornekrall's wonderful description of Crumwell reveals much about the 19th century, including his activities that we still need to celebrate.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many believe that Cramwell worked very hard to protect Parliament from foreign powers during his dictatorship, perhaps more so than he did in the 19th century.
I don't know if there is enough information about him in the media.
The real point is that our race evolved post-colonially due to a conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century, when Cromwell was leading a crucial part of that time.
His achievements as a Lord Protector should be remembered and celebrated."
A Chinese farmer was killed in a pig attack
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
Only his household name, known as "Yuan," was seriously injured in the attack, which left him lying in a pool of blood at a market stall in the Liupanshui Parantem in the Dwijohu area, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in the Jining of Qinghai region of China prepared to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse.
According to news reports, he along with his cousin came to the market from the nearby Yunnan area to sell his 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin noticed his dead body, with the door opening to a stair by the side.
He said that he noticed that there were blood stains on the muzzle of a big male pig in the sty.
According to a report by forensic experts, the farmer died due to an attack by a pig weighing 550 pounds.
According to Jiang Evening News, "My cousin's legs were broken and full of blood," he said, calling the farmer a "yes."
Based on security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday.
About an hour later, his body was found.
It's not just the farmer or his family.
By the time the police reached the spot, we had captured the pig without attacking others, the market manager told Evening News.
The family and the market officials of Yuan are discussing compensation for the death of Yuan.
It is rare for humans to be attacked by pigs, but there have been cases in the past as well.
In 2016, a man was seriously injured in a pig attack on his wife's farm in Massachusetts.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds was attacked by a Welsh farmer at his tractor, the last of his wives to come and chase it away.
After a 2012 association in which an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, a manetoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not dangerous, but the taste of the blood is "rotten."
"They are clean.
They're comfortable, enthusiastic... and they won't hurt you.
"You have to respect them," he said.
The remaining parts of Hurricane Rosa cause widespread rainfall in the southwestern U.S.
According to estimates, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it travels toward colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, Hurricane Rosa could cause flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S.
As of 5 a.m., the winds in Rosa were blowing at a speed of 85 mph, which was a Category 1 hurricane. On Saturday, 385 miles southwest of Punta Ouguinia, Mexico.
It's expected to go well on Sunday.
During this time, a trough will form in the Pacific Ocean and may travel eastward to the west of the US. By the time Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will form in the northern part of the southwestern US, resulting in continental moisture.
On Monday, 10 inches of rain fell in Mexico due to Rosa.
After that, if the trough is accompanied by highland moisture, there will be heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain can cause severe flooding, flooding, and landslides in the desert.
Rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour may be recorded in some areas, especially in the southern Nevada and Arizona region due to extreme tropical humidity.
One estimate is that 2 to 4 inches of rain may fall in the Southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Tropical rain is likely to be widespread and there is a risk of sudden flooding due to rapidly changing weather conditions.
It is dangerous to walk in the desert on foot, as there is a risk of tropical rain.
Rivers in the valleys can become violent due to heavy rains and localized extreme winds due to thunderstorms can cause the garbage to pile up.
The storm is expected to bring heavy rain to parts of Southern California.
A total of half an inch of rainfall can cause debris to flow and make the roads smooth and slippery.
It was the first rain of the season in the area.
Showers are possible in the Arizona region due to tropical rain on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before heavy rain on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rain is expected to continue into Tuesday and into Wednesday.
The U.S. climate may change slightly in October as the Arctic region cools, but the tropical region remains warm.
Sometimes, this can be due to dramatic changes in the weather over short distances.
The dramatic change in the US between Monday and Monday is a good example.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa have an average temperature difference of about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, the summer heat, etc., can be extended.
Temperatures in most of the central and eastern U.S. begin in early October and can extend from the south to the northeast, reaching as high as 80 degrees.
Temperatures can reach 80 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, 10 degrees higher than normal.
Based on years of conditions, temperatures in the eastern U.S. may be above average through the first half of October.
The trial of Bret Kavanaugh was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and of a woman named Christie Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, via six TV channels on Thursday.
At the same time, the news agencies were also in the middle of a routine event with the intention of something strange happening at the last minute on Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake drafted a deal asking the FBI to investigate the allegations within a week.
Fold told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he had a 100 percent memory of forcibly dragging himself into a drunken mirage and trying to undress while strictly at a high school party.
He said that he was 100 per cent aware that no such incident had taken place.
Nielsen estimated that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday.
The company calculates the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
Numbers for other networks, such as PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network, are not readily available.
Nielsen usually has trouble counting the number of people watching from the office.
To give an example, a lot of people saw it at the playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News channel, which fully supported Kavano's appointment, was watched by an average of 5.69 million people throughout the day.
The second-ranked ABC has 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that there were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC, and 2.52 million on CNN.
The interest continued to the same level even after the trial.
The Blues played a key role in Saturday's game.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying we will vote in support of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured footage on Friday of Flack expressing outrage at the protesters he encountered while going on an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He has been criticized by many, and has been live-streamed on CNN so that he can stand up for several minutes.
"I'm in front of you," a woman said.
Do you think he's telling the truth?
"You have power, but a lot of women are helpless," he told him.
My office released a statement, but I will say more things at the committee hearings," Flake said during the closing of the elevator.
The cable and broadcast networks broadcast hours later during the Judiciary Committee voting on Kavano's nomination to the full Senate for the vote.
"I'll admit that only after the FBI agrees to investigate these allegations next week, as sought by the minority Democrats."
The president's remarks were echoed by Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
The decision was made after consulting with several other senators, including Coons.
There is a power to the decision of Flake, which is a sign that the Republicans will not accept the nomination without a trial.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has accused Brexit critics of "doing politics"
Prime Minister Theresa May told the Sunday Times that those criticising her decision to leave the European Union were "doing politics" with Britain's future and were ignoring the country's interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on 29 September 2018 to attend the Conservative Party Conference.
In another interview with the newspaper that published his picture on the front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson only faulted Theresa May's actions, saying it was wrong of Britain to want Britain and the EU to collect taxes from each other at a "very high cost."
The police have arrested dietian simpson in connection with the death of an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the case that led to the death of 20-year-old basketball player Wyde Sims at LSU.
The 20-year-old was arrested and sent to jail and booked in a second-degree murder case in Boston Rogue, police said.
Authorities have released a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, in which Sissy's spectacles fell off.
The police collected spectacles from the scene, which contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
When Simpson was questioned, the police told him to admit that he had shot Vaidehi.
His bond was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Boston Rog Parish Canner Officer released a preliminary report on Friday, stating that Wyde died of a gunshot wound to the neck from head to toe.
The arrests were made based on investigations made with the help of the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Torque Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and local citizens, the department said.
LSU's athletics director, Joe Allewa, thanked the local police for "investigation and justice."
Sims is 20 years old.
At 6.6 feet, he grew up in Boston Rogue, where his father also played LSU-era basketball.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the team as a whole was "sad" and "shocked" by Wyde's death, said LSU team coach Vale Wide.
"It's always going to be the beach," he said.
A fire broke out in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocat<0xC3><0xA9>petl fire reached southern areas of Mexico's capital city.
The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (NDMA) has warned people to stay away from the volcano as it erupted 183 times in 24 hours.
The Centre is monitoring several thunderstorms and tremors.
Images on social media showed ash forming in the form of a thin layer on the mirrors of cars in areas around Mexico's capital, such as Jochimilco.
Geologists say it has risen to 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the mountain since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
"Dan Goyo" is a mountain of fire that has been active since 1944.
Clashes broke out between police and Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona during Saturday's clash between protesters supporting independence and riot control police, and thousands of opponents also gathered to celebrate the first anniversary of the unification of Catalonia on the vote on secession.
The streets were filled with smoke as the separatists swarmed and threw eggs and powder paint on the police, who were controlling the rioting, though usually more tourists.
Police resorted to baton charge to control the violence.
For several hours, independence activists chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive," and Unionist protesters chanted "Spain Zindabad."
According to local media reports, 14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests.
The year after Madrid declared the October 1 Referendum illegal, there was tension in areas seeking independence, but the secessionist Catalans celebrated it.
A lot more like those who voted wanted independence, but the turnout was low due to the large number of people banning voting.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured when police tried to block voting in violent areas ahead of last year's vote.
Independent pro-democracy groups have campaigned to avoid a demonstration on Friday night in support of national policy.
The show went on, but it went on.
"We have lost all hope of independence for Catalonia," said Narcissist Termes, 68, an electrician involved in the secessionist protest.
Last year was the happiest year of our lives.
"My parents were happy when I got the chance to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
After a narrow victory in last year's regional elections and a decisive victory, Catalan independence parties have either kept their leaders under house arrest or in police custody, awaiting trial, holding a referendum and declaring independence this year.
According to a 42-year-old mechanic named Jovan Peuge, who is recording the protest in support of the police, the dispute was caused by politicians on both sides.
"It's growing every day," he said.
On Saturday, Oriel Jan Queras, one of the Catalan leaders who has been in pre-arrest since last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
"The only way to fight in the European elections is for the anti-democratic measures and repressive tendencies that the Spanish government is taking," he said.
London: A man has been arrested in connection with a car crash
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting at a home in London's Derry.
The incident took place at Balinagarh Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.

Meng's men's strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga scored the first goal for Livingston
The Rangers were surprised by the promoted Livingston, which was the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The major change was due to the strike made by Dolly Menga, with the Geary Holt side having increased level, with the Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard Side is one win away from winning the Premiership this season and they will take on the leaders Hearts next Sunday.
The Rangers will host the Rapid Viennese on Thursday.
During this time, Livingston expanded his reprobate tour to six wins, with no loss until the arrival of Holtstil, who replaced Kenny Miller as head coach last month.
Livingston missed a chance with a blunt visitor
The Holt team was supposed to be in the lead long before they scored, and Rangers were plagued by all sorts of problems due to their straight counterattack.
Scott Robinson tried hard to score the break-through goal, and then faced Gregg Halkett when Allan Lithgow tried to score directly.
The hosts faced the Rangers well when they played with the hosts, and they got the visitors into trouble all the way.
In this way, they achieved an important goal.
The Rangers made a free-kick, while Livingston focused on the opening, with the help of Declan Gellager and Robinson paving the way for Meng, who scored in the middle of the net with a touchdown.
At that stage, the Rangers were danimated, but due to the home defense being solid, they couldn't trouble goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo saved a force from Kelly, but the same pattern continued in the second half.
Scott Pittman failed due to Alan McGroeger, the Rangers goalkeeper, who flicked Lithgow away from the set play of Livingston.
Crosses that came into Livingston box in a row were cleared, at the same time two penalty claims became superfluous, one when Substitute Glen Middleton was challenged by Halkett and the other due to handball.
"Financial" from Livingston
Alessandra Lamont of the BBC Statland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenological presentation and outcome of Livingston.
They're playing well and they're improving.
Their play and behaviour completely changed after they reached the top, but it was Halt who completely changed the course of the team after he took over.
He has made many heroes.
Captain Halket made a brilliant, well-ordered defence, while only Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Vorrell busy.
The Rangers have also lost their spirit.
They played their best when Gerard was there, and now they've lost their vows.
Their final performance wasn’t quite right <0xE2><0x80><0x93> only once did they manage to get a good home side open, so it’s a warning to the Rangers, who have recently been staying in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed welcome in Cologne
On September 29, the leaders of Germany and Turkey met in Berlin, Germany.
President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s controversial visit to Germany ends today <0xE2><0x80><0x93> the visit is being held to improve relations with NATO allies.
Several issues have arisen, including human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is going to Cologne for the opening of a large new mosque.
It is the largest city outside of Turkey.
Police have restricted the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque for security reasons, but only his supporters have come in large numbers to see their president.
Many of the protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurdish people, protested Erdogan's policies and the German government that had invited him to the country.
During the visit, some Turkish people in Germany criticized him as a hero, while his opponents criticized him as a dictator.
A cyclist was killed in a road accident in Deptford
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
At about 10:15 BST, the incident took place at the intersection of Best Wood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car was taken into custody, but he died at the scene.
A few months ago, on Saturday, this happened after a cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run case on Children's Street, a mile away from the location.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and report the matter to his relatives.
Some roads in the area have been closed, buses have been diverted, and motorists have been advised not to travel in the area.
Long Larti Jail: Six officials injured in clashes
Six prison officials were injured in the clashes at the high-security prison, the jail official said.
Clashes began and continue at the HMP Lang in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday.
We have deployed special "Tornado" officers in the field to control the clashes, including eight men, in a wing.
The officers sustained minor injuries in the incident.
A prison service spokesman said: "We are currently deploying specially trained prison staff to deal with the ongoing unrest in HMP Longlawrt.
Six officers were injured.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, those responsible for this must be handed over to the police, and their training must be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Longlawn, some of whom are some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that a prison guard was attacked by a prisoner and that he was being treated in the hospital.
In October last year, there were serious problems with the pool balls attacking the officers and special officers were brought in to control them.
There is a risk of flooding in the city of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to Hurricane Rosa (may benefit drought areas)
This is likely to happen early next week as there is a risk of flooding along the southwestern desert due to the rare tropical weather that has formed in Arizona and the residual power of Hurricane Rosa.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding for Monday and Tuesday in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, as well as areas in western Arizona such as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah.
The race will be held in full swing on Tuesday morning, with rain forecast for the rest of the day.
According to a tweet by the National Weather Service in Phoenix, "Since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones in the 200-mile range to the Phoenix have turned into tropical cyclones or depressions!"
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that formed about 40 miles from the AZ border.
According to the National Hurricane Center's latest estimates, 2 to 4 inches of rain may fall, with up to 6 inches in the Mongol Rim in Arizona under some special circumstances.
The Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as other parts of the southwestern desert may receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches likely in some special areas.
Some areas have been without water for a long time due to flooding.
Flooding is a big problem, but it can benefit from the recent drought in the southwestern part.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, more than 40 percent of Arizona has at least one of the most severe droughts and two of the largest categories, according to weather.com.
First, landslides broke out on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico due to Hurricane Rosa.
On Sunday morning, Rosa was still at the level of a hurricane when winds were blowing at a speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles per hour north of Punta Uguin<0xC3><0xAD>a, Mexico, as it was heading north for 12 miles per hour.
The storm is slowly weakening as it enters the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean.
So it may lead to landslides at the tropical airway level in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains can cause flooding in many parts of Mexico.
"Baja may receive 3 to 6 inches of rain from California to northwest Sonora, which is likely to reach a maximum of 10 inches," informed weather.com.
Rosa then travels north of Mexico on a tropical storm level, becoming like a tropical depression by the time it reaches Arizona's borders on Tuesday morning, and then heads out of Arizona into southern Utah by Tuesday night.
"Heavy rain is likely to occur mainly due to Rosa or the rest of it in Baja California, northwest Sonora, the U.S. Southwest Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains can lead to deadly floods, desert runoff, and landslides in hilly areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four men charged with attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested in connection with the alleged attempt to murder of a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
At around 4:00 BST on Saturday, Midsomer was lying with injuries in the Excelsior Terrace area of Norton.
He was rushed to the hospital, where his health was "stable."
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds, and a 20-year-old man were arrested in Rod Stock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Police have asked anyone with a mobile phone to report the incident.
"Trump said, ""The Democratic Party has suffered because of cruelty and anger."""
"Voting for a new president is a rejection of the brutal and anarchic actions of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump said that throughout his nomination process, the Democratic Party has suffered because of the cruelty and anger it has caused.
Decades ago, when I was a young man, Cavanaugh appeared before Congress on Thursday after Christine Blasey Ford accused me of being coerced, mentally harassed, and sexually assaulted.
Ford has also appeared in court over his allegations.
"The people of the United States have seen the wisdom, quality and courage that was shown on that day," he said.
"Voting in support of Justice Kavanaugh means voting in support of the most effective legal professionals in contemporary times, the man who has served the nation the most," he said.
He also talked about the importance of voting in the midterm elections.
"In just five weeks, one of the most important elections of our lives is about to take place.
I don't want to run, but I have to run," he said.
"That's why I go everywhere and support amazing candidates."
"Democrats are creating barriers," Trump said.
One of the GOP leadership told CNN that the first crucial procedural vote for Kavanaugh's nomination could be held before Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is still rising
At least 384 people have been killed and several others are missing after a massive earthquake and tsunami rocked coastal areas on Indonesia's Sulawesi island, officials said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu city on Friday to celebrate the festival, while waves as high as six metres (18 feet) took many lives and destroyed everything in and around it.
The quake was followed by a 7.5 magnitude tsunami.
"Even after yesterday's tsunami alerts, people are still not able to immediately flee the coast and become victims because they are so engrossed in their work," Sutopo Purwo Nurgoo, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
"It wasn't the usual tsunami that was coming, it was the one that grabbed all the cars, logs and houses on the ground," said Nurgoho, adding that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) across the sea before hitting the coast.
He said some people were able to climb trees to escape the tsunami and save their lives.
About 16,700 people have been shifted to 24 centres in Palu.
According to photos released by the disaster agency, many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges collapsed and fell, and water all around the mosque.
Tensions continued in the city on Saturday.
There are 2.4 million people living in the area.
According to Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Utilization Agency (BPPT), the energy released during Friday's massive earthquake was 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
He added that the city has a long and narrow coastline, which is likely to increase in intensity.
He said the damage was "extremely severe" and thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said some victims' corpses were found under the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 were missing.
He said the loss of life and damage was likely to be heavy in Dongla, a region near the epicentre of the earthquake, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu.
The information from Dongla was "completely frozen," said Nurgogoho.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that "our employees and volunteers are going to help in the affected areas."
"It's already been a tragic event, but it could be even more painful," they said.
Although authorities say the waves hit the coast at the same time as the warning, many have criticized the agency for not informing them of the tsunami that hit the city of Palu on Saturday.
A video shared on social media showed a man standing on a building, warning people down the street that a tsunami was coming, and running away.
Within a few minutes, a large wall-like wave hit the shore, taking away buildings and cars.
The footage could not be immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The power supply was completely cut off due to the earthquake and tsunami, which caused traffic around Pallu to be disrupted, making it difficult for authorities to provide relief.
The army is sending planes carrying supplies from Jakarta and other cities, but the displaced still need a lot of food and other basic amenities, officials said.
The airport in the city is open only for rescue operations, which will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the affected areas on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunami has passed 800.
Its very saddening.
"World Vision employees in Dongla went to the city of Palu, stayed in tents set up in the courtyard of their office, and shot and sent the horrific scenes at work," Doceba said.
He said: "I saw a lot of houses.
Its very saddening.
Relief teams began their relief efforts very quickly, but some complained that foreign volunteers, who were experts, were not being allowed to come to the city of Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funds and supplies can only be received in the event of a disaster when the area is declared a national disaster area.
The announcement has not been made yet.
"It's still a disaster limited to one area," said Indonesia's Red Cross spokesman Aaliyah Arianyi.
"If the government does so and declares, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can allow international aid, but not at the moment."
This is the second day after the tsunami and earthquake hit the city of Palu on Friday, and it is now night, even though family and friends have gone missing, they remain safe somewhere and are still waiting for their loved ones to return safely from natural disasters.
A boy was rescued from the rubble on Monday.
On Sunday, rescue teams rescued a woman who had been stuck between the debris for two days, with her mother's body beside her.
Two trained paragliders from Gendan Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, have gone missing, who were training for the Asian Games in Indonesia earlier this month.
The rest of the people stranded at Rowa Rowa Hotel were my students," said Mandagi.
He said: "I have a lot of respect for the seniors on the field.
Gendon explained how he had informed the beach festival participants in WhatsApp messages within hours of the collapse of the Rowa Rowa hotel.
But his messages came only grey ticks, not blue ticks.
He said: "My message is not lost.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling cash at an ATM in Newport, Livy
On Friday morning, Newport Police released a press release stating that the thieves had stolen $26,750 while Brink's employees were filling out cash at an ATM in Newport, Livy.
Detective Dennis McCarthy released a statement saying the driver had emptied the ATM at an entertainment complex and was trying to fill it with more money.
While he was doing his work "a man came running from the back of the brick employee", he snatched the bag containing money to be filled in the ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses say there were several suspects at the scene, but police did not give an exact number of people involved.
Anyone with information about them should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to "Yay"
Kanye West is changing his name.
On Saturday, he wrote on Twitter: "Everyone knows Kanye West is in power."
The 41-year-old West, who has been nicknamed "Ye Everybody" for some time, used the name Manikar for Tani's eighth album, which was released in June.
He's about to release his new album Yandhi on Saturday Night Live, and this change has been pushed forward even before that.
He will replace Ariana Grande, who left the show due to "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
It is of great importance not only as a nickname for his current professional name but also according to his religious beliefs.
"I believe the word 'ye' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible 'ye' means you," West said earlier this year while discussing the name of his album with the radio host Big Boy.
"It's me, it's me, it's all of us.
"Kanye means one and only one, and from there to just you, it is the testimony of all that is good, evil, and chaos in us.
The album is about who we are."
He is one of the most famous rappers to have changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and he announced this year that he likes Puff Daddy and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, formerly with West, changed his name to Hyphen or Capitals.
Mexico's AML says it will not use military force against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has said he will no longer use military force against civilians in the 50th anniversary of the massacre.
"I will never use the army for the suppression of civilians," Loebze Obrador declared Saturday at the Plaza Latello.
On October 2, 1968, more than 300 people were killed when the military opened fire on a peaceful protest by left-wing students across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to work hard for the betterment of young Mexicans by offering monthly subsidies to young educated people and by establishing more free public universities.
He said the youth are committing crimes due to unemployment and illiteracy.
U.S. spending on A.I. should double
Kai-fu Lee, an investor and AI practitioner who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, says that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, and the U.S. should spend more on research.
He said this when several departments of the U.S. government made statements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole did not have an official plan for AI.
At the same time, China released its plan last year: Set a goal of being number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Since all the other countries are far behind the U.S., doubling the investment in AI is a good start, so that we can find even better things in AI," Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the funding would double the chance of new U.S. successes in AI.
Lee wrote a book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", which was published by the Harcourt of Houghton Mifflin, the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in Face<0x2B><0x2B>, the most prominent AI company in China.
In 1980, Carnegie became the highest-ranked American Othello player when he worked on an AI system at the University of Mellon, and later worked as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee previously referred to the Defense Advanced Research Project's Robotics Challenge as a U.S. government technology and asked when the next project was coming up to help identify future plans.
In the U.S., researchers usually have to work very hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"They're taking on academic leaders, not corporates," he said.
Other technology companies such as Facebook and Google have been hiring experts in AI from universities in recent years.
Lee also said that it would be a good idea to change the immigration policy as part of the AI efforts being made by the U.S.
"It's also a good idea to give a green card to those who have done PhDs in AI immediately," he said.
The State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Li said that just as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund U.S. researchers, the National Natural Science Foundation in China also funds those in educational institutions, but the quality of academic work in China is poor.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, taking some from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA has announced that it will be investing $2 billion in an AI Next initiative this month.
For the NSF, more than $100 million is spent annually on AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. law establishing a national security commission on artificial intelligence had not been enforced for months.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on the country's name change
Macedonians voted Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" because of the decades-long dispute with Greece over the country's current name, which has resulted in the country's inability to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a region called Macedonia, but claims that the country to its north is attempting to occupy the region, preventing them from joining the European Union and NATO, using its veto power.
An agreement was reached between the two governments based on the newly proposed name, but the change was opposed by the Nationalists, who argued that most of the Slavic population would lose its ethnic identity in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not take part in the referendum, and that a campaign was underway to ban it, so he doubted whether at least 50 percent of the electorate would vote if it was necessary.
The question on the Referendum Ballot was: "Do you approve the agreement reached by NATO and the Government of Greece for EU membership?"
Supporters, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zyve, have argued that a name change is necessary for Macedonia, one of the emerging countries after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to become a member of the EU and NATO.
"I came to vote for the future of the country because I want the coming generations of Macedonia to be happy and to live in freedom under the protection of countries like the European Union," said Olivera George Eveska, 79, of Skopje.
Many MPs said they would respect the outcome of the vote, even if there was no legal provision.
The name change must be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has informed that no disturbance has been caused till 1.00 p.m.
In the 2016 parliamentary elections, 34 percent of the electorate voted and 66 percent of the registered voters voted, with only 16 percent voting for the police.
"I have come to vote for the future of my children, for this country in Europe," said Joke, 62, of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Jeev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in Srumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018 in support of a referendum to change the name of the country that would grant Macedonia a seat in NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is erecting a small platform in front of the parliament in Skopje, with chairs in small tents erected by opponents of the Referendum.
"We should join NATO and the EU, but not go through the latrine, with self-respect," Kawardhakov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have self-respect.
If they don't agree with us on the name Macedonia, then we can join the European and Asian Union together with countries like China and Russia."
Prime Minister Jaiveer said Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment, would make huge investments if it became a member of NATO.
"Most people support this, with more than 80 percent of citizens favoring the EU and NATO," he said after the vote.
"We're confident about the future," he said.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Policy Research Center in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 percent of participants in the Referendum, which is lower than the minimum requirement.
In another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of those polled said they would vote on Sunday.
70% of them said yes.
For a second referendum to be successful, at least one vote must be more than 50 percent.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first major setback for a Western-backed government since it was formed in May last year.

On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim led Manchester City to a 2-0 win over Brighton at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In the 65th minute, Aguero scored easily.
At the beginning of the season, the Argentine striker was given a pass in the midfield.
He was accompanied by two Brighton defenders before he was swept into the open field.
The four of them then turned to Green.
He took a step back before he reached the edge of the box.
Then he turned to the left and leaned forward.
While the English forward delivered the ball to Aguero with his first touch, he passed Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan with the right boot and hit the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguaroku is suffering from foot problems," city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to him at 55, 60 minutes.
Thats what had happened.
We were lucky to have him at the time."
Sterling has provided the initial advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League Scuffle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.

Schurzer wants to play in a spoiler match with the Rockies
The Nationals were eliminated from the playoff competition, so no matter how well they played, there was no big advantage.
Sharper, who has always been enthusiastic about playing brilliantly against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but whether this will affect Rockies' playoff chances, is already in a game-leading position with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
"Even if we don't have the benefit of this match, the people here in Denver are very enthusiastic and our opponent is more aggressive than all the teams I've played in the whole of this year, so it's going to be exciting.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but it seems likely that in such a case the Sharzer could be allowed to pitch.
The 34-year-old, who is set to make his 34th start on Thursday, will be in a bullpen session on Sunday, usually on a good swing where he needs to rest.

Trump's rally in West Virginia
Trump was referring to the ongoing controversy surrounding his Supreme Court-nominated Kavanaugh, saying the Republican Party's victory in the midterm elections was important.
All of our work is done in November.
In a few weeks, we will have one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of those big ones - I don't want to run, but I'm running to all the places to support the wonderful candidates."
"This is happening now because of these terrible extremists belonging to the Democrats.
They are trying to come back to power by any means, they are ready to go down to any level.
They can hurt anyone for power, and they can do anything, but we must not let power go into their hands."
"Democrats are on a mission to disrupt and disrupt."
"Look at the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats " Copts, liars, creepy and untrustworthy people."
The audience roared when he mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who holds the Senate Judiciary Committee rank.
"Do you remember the answer?"
Have you picked up the paper?
Nothing, nothing.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not good with your body language - it's the worst body language I've ever known."
The church is no longer a church.
This is an insult to those who believe in free speech.
I was surprised to see that my local MP was involved.
I was also included in the list of Labour MPs who had difficulties in freely sharing their views.
The same thing happened to my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, for opposing hatred for the Jews.
I have been critical of Jeremy Corbyn.
I was opposed to responsible policies such as European economic policy and national security, but Jeremy was also opposed to those before him.
On Friday, a notice from the Nguyen East Labor Conference said: "We need to get everyone together at the meetings and achieve good results."
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, most of the meetings were held in full on Friday night, just like the GC meetings.
The sad thing is that conventions and politics are no longer held "in love and respect," and have long since disappeared.
There is no room for dissent in the Labour Party, and every opinion must be consistent with the party leadership.
This practice began within days of Jeremy's becoming leader, and we regret that all like-minded party members, including me, would have to make a U-turn on every issue and compromise whether we like it or not on national security or the EU single market.
If I say anything in public, regardless of what I say, they will immediately start vulgar attacks on me on social media, saying that I should not be in the Labour Party at all.
It doesn't just happen to me.
If you look at the comments of some of my colleagues, I feel better about myself than they do about politics.
I am amazed at the courage and commitment of my colleagues, who face harassment, whether sexual or racial, every day.
The lack of a common language is a very sad thing in politics today.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said there should be a Labour Party to promote tolerance for all.
But, of course, now it's not so much a broad church as every "no-confidence" resolution or a change of chosen rules is still becoming nuanced.
Over the last couple of years, many people have suggested that I should go head-to-head and not speak in public, but that "everything is fine."
But thats not how it works in politics.
32 years ago I decided to join the Labour Party, be it a local councillor or a minister in the government, because of the reckless attitude of the Thatcher government which caused the almost total collapse of my school class building.
I have never voted in any election, not even in the last election.
"Everyone in Nottingham East is clearly aware of my policy views and my differences with the current leadership.
"At a time when all families, businesses or government services in the country are struggling because of Brexit, I want to tell those who have introduced the motion on Friday that I will not waste my energy and time by remaining loyal to the Labour Party.
I say to all the members of my constituency in Nottingham Momentum, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: It is my privilege to serve you, I will work for the good of all of you and I will never compromise because of these exclusionary threats or political interests.

Ayer 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayer is now at the top of the standings
The end result may have been slightly different due to the two last-minute efforts, but today Ayer, who showed excellent performance in the Tenant Premiership, deserves a place at the top.
Now that they are at the top of the table, this team has not been beaten so far.
In the end, this victory was possible because they made good use of their excellent defense as well as the chances, a feat that must have gone to coach Peter Murchie.
"We have faced many challenges so far, but we have not lost at all, so I am very happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayer, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's attempt, a convert made by Frazier Climo, came to the fore, but Slotland released Cap Ror Hughes for the Yellow Card and Warriors game, resulting in Melrose taking no chances and Jason Baggett trying one.
Ayer came to the fore with a penalty scored by Clemmo exactly at half-time, and then, due to his score in the break time, Ayer reached 17-5.
Melrose started the second half well, with Patrick Anderson's effort and the convert made by Bagat reduced the score to five points.
The game was halted for a long time due to an injury to Raurid Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and Ayer moved further ahead as he was converted by the attempt of Stafford McDowell after the game resumed.
Ayer's acting captain MacPherson got the yellow card, and Melrose made good use of his extra in Bruce Calvin's failure in the high-pressure game.
However, the home side rebounded, and Stroon Hutchinson received a yellow card for chasing Clemson even without the ball, giving back to McPherson for Ayer advancing from the penalty line-up.
After David Armstrong caught a box kick by Kyle Rowe and sent Gregor Henry away from the home side's fifth attempt, Clemmons did the same when the match resumed.
Game of Thrones is moving to a new location
After still-game star was announced as a director of a licensed restaurant company, he is entering into the realm of hospitality.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he co-wrote with fellow comedian Greed Hemphill.
The two announced that the show would end with the upcoming ninth season, possibly with Kieran hoping to start a new life after Craig Lang.
As per the official records, he is the director of Adrift Morn Ltd.
The Scottish Sun source reported that Kieran was entering GlassGo's "excellent restaurant business," although he did not respond to the article.
"Sea of Man": Bolivia, which has land on all four sides, hopes to reopen its passage to the Pacific through a court of law
The sailors arrived at the rigging clad naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags were hoisted in government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the slogan has become: "It's our right to go out to sea."
We have a responsibility to bring it back."
Bolivia, a landlocked country on four sides, was forced to cede a coastal strip to Chile in the 19th century due to a resource dispute, and was eager to once again venture into the Pacific Ocean.
They have been on the same page for decades, but the International Court of Justice is due to deliver its verdict on October 1 after five years of protracted negotiations.
"Bolivia is on a good footing, there is unity, there is calm, so we hope for a good result," said Roberto Callzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will see the ICJ ruling on the big screen, saying the hag has turned in their favour due to Bolivia's decades-long fight and now Chile will negotiate with them and give them some space at sea.
Locally-populated President Evo Morales is set to seek re-election next year amid a series of controversies, even as he is keen on Monday's decision.
"We're going back to the Pacific Ocean very soon," he said in August.
However, many analysts believe that the court's decision may not be in Bolivia's favor, and that the ruling will only bring about a slight change.
The UN in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate Chile's territory, and it is not possible to say what the outcome will be even if negotiations take place.
The ICJ's decision is expected within six months of the completion of the first arguments, and the case is not so "complex," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Whatever Bolivia's desire, it may have been a set back in the last four years.
"The current government has hijacked Bolivia's desire to have a sea route," he said.
Some of the good impression on Chile has also been damaged due to the excellent eloquence of Moleris, she said.
At one point, there were talks between Bolivia and Chile, but it was difficult to resume them after these developments.
The two countries have not sent diplomats to each other since 1962.
Former Bolivian President Edurda Rodriguez Weltez, who is also Bolivia's representative in the Hague, rejected the idea that the court was working too fast.
On Monday, he said, "Bolivia will have an excellent opportunity to start a new era in our relations with Chile" by "removing difficulties that have existed in mutual interest for 139 years."
Callzadilla dismissed the argument that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the issue to his political advantage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to enter the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"This is an opportunity to forget the past."
North Korea says it will not give up its nuclear weapons until it has full confidence in the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has said that North Korea will not stop developing nuclear weapons until it has gained full confidence in Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday.
He urged the US to fulfill its promises made during the talks between the leaders of the rival countries in Singapore.
He was speaking as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's efforts to restart nuclear weapons diplomacy went unheeded more than three months after talks with the North Korean president in Singur.
Rie said it was a "daylight" to assume that North Korea would only land as long as sanctions were maintained and the U.S. did not declare the end of the Korean War.
We will not make a statement unless Pyongyang lowers its weapons, Washington said.
Both Kim and U.S. President Trump want a second round of talks.
There is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang is really ready to give up arms, which is the only way to protect its country.
Kim is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to hold a second round of talks with US President Donald Trump.
You'll be able to see some of the amazing hats on display at the upcoming fashion show in Paris for the High Street near you
If you're looking for a new hat, stay out of the sun.
Designers Valentin and Thom Brown will be showcasing their SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
These hats, which are not normally worn, have been well-liked on Instagram this summer, and the designers have impressed with the models by wearing their hats on the catwalk.
A hat made by Valentino, which looks like the feathers of the heads of the models, attracted the attention of all.
Other large accessories include bejeweled water milans, wizard's hat, and pineapple, but these aren't made for keeping your head warm.
Thomas Browne showed some weird masks for Halloween.
Most of the colorful masks have lip-studded figures that look like a harmless lectern rather than like a hot culture.
One is like a scuba diving gear with scuba gear, while the other is like a melted ice-cream cone.
You're lucky to see it all.
The style watchers have estimated that a very large number of bonnets are likely to come to the high streets near you.
The big hats were worn by 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Rajkowski.
These big hats that can't be worn at all in everyday life have gone viral on social media with a cult label, the same catwalk in which the Straw Beach batch wore a swim suit that was so large.
Jacquemus la Rivera SS19 collection features a bunt orange raffia bag, a raffia fringe and a white leather handle on top.
Luc Armitage, a celebrity stylist, told her: 'I want to see these big hats and beach bags on the High Street next summer - the designer has done a fantastic job, and now there's no denying the demand for these big accessories.'
John Edwards: Global Citizens Need Language Skills
Independent schools in Scotland offer an excellent education, which is once again proven by the results of an excellent test in 2018, in which individuals and teams hone their skills in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With over 30,000 students across Slotland, the schools are run by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) to provide the best possible education for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to provide higher education to their students, transform their lives and make them global citizens.
In the field of education, which aims to unearth talent among students, modern languages are being chosen as the most popular and most sought after curriculum in the school.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his brain.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, it goes to his heart."
Therefore, it is a proof that we cannot rely on English alone to form relationships with other countries and gain their trust.
The results of this year's examination showed that students in independent schools were passing out with the highest number of students opting for languages as their main curriculum.
68% of foreign language learners have a higher grade A.
According to data collected from SCIS schools, which have 74 members, 72 percent got Mandarin Higher Grade A, 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French, and 63 percent of those studying Spanish earned A.
This means that Scotland's independent schools provide knowledge of foreign languages that will be of future use to children and young adults.
Independent schools in Curriculums and elsewhere have now become elective subjects, just like the STEM curriculum (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Jobs and Skills, language skills were the top 17 percent of the reasons for non-skilled jobs.
Language skills are very important for the future of the youth.
Language skills are very important in today's world.
No matter where you are in the world, learning a second language will help you a lot.
People with knowledge who can speak in their language directly with those who come from abroad will definitely be the frontrunners in the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language to the level of communication, and only 15 percent were able to speak French.
It is very important for children to learn different languages.
Learning multiple languages, especially those from developing countries, gives children a better chance of getting a job.
Every school in Scotland has a different language.
Most schools are teaching more classic modern languages, while others focus on 2020 as the UK requires, such as Japanese or Mandarin.
No matter what your child chooses, the experts in this area will be available at the independent schools to help them learn those languages.
Independent schools in Scotland provide a range of services to help children adapt to the environment and prepare them for the challenges of the future.
This can be rejected at the moment, but in the world of business, languages are going to be very crucial for the future of the country, so education should be included.
Modern languages must be considered "international communication skills."
Independent schools for Scotland's young must offer this option, diversity, and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward, Director of The Scottish Council of Independent Schools
The Lakers are hoping to play LeBron for the first time on Saturday in San Diego.
That's good news for fans looking forward to LeBron James' first-ever game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton said James will play in the pre-season opener against Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
He didn't know how many minutes he had left.
"More than one, less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers report Mike Trudel tweeted that James was probably only able to play for a limited number of minutes.
James was asked what plans he had for a six-game pre-season schedule during a practice earlier this week.
"At this point in my career, I don't need my preseason games to be ready," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign from Wheeling, Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including spots in friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The confirmation vote for his nominee for the Supreme Court was halted, and he began campaigning for the midterm election over concerns that Republicans would lose the November election.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight, and how to watch it online?
Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in Wheeling, Virginia at 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online through the YouTube live stream below.
The Senate confirmation vote is likely to be suspended for a week until the FBI's investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is completed, which Trump is likely to speak about.
This is especially important for the Republicans in the November election.
So the main goal of the five rallies next week is to "encourage volunteers and Republican supporters, retain and maintain their current dominance in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
"Trump will travel to as many states as possible during this campaign to keep a grip on Congress," one of the campaign's official spokespersons said without giving his name.
"Supporters in Oreo and Pennsylvania can come and it will be covered by the Pittsburgh Media," West Virginia Metro News said in a statement.
He arrived in West Virginia on Saturday, the second visit in recent months, where Trump won by more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Marise, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not good for Mr. Morris to have to come directly to the president to boost his campaign," said Simon Heeder, an expert on political science at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA made every effort to keep alive the chances of advancing into the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, if foursomes had taken place by Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup would have been necessary.
Like the swinging pendulum of momentum, players feel that the game can change at any moment, and it's certainly possible in such competitions.
Where do you think the market is now?
"They used to be six points ahead, now it's up to four, which means we're carrying the momentum a little bit better," said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, however, has an advantage with four points, with 12 remaining.
In Spieth's words, Americans had a very positive atmosphere and good encouragement from fans, with Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together throughout the day, scoring four points each from a situation where there were three points.
St. Paul is a wonderful example.
He and Thomas scored two points each and then scored two more to win the match with a total of four All-Square.
Even when he got to 15 because of his putt, everyone cried like this, which means that the American team still has a lot of hope left.
"Now it's really a very difficult situation for your own match," Spieth said.
It's all in these games.
There are 18 marks.
Only Franco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days in the Ryder Cup.
Only the most beautiful couples in Europe have achieved the Four Four, and they are not doing anything wrong.
Not only did the "Mollywood" couple shoot a Saturday afternoon bogey, but they also did a bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, Friday morning in Nine.
Those runs, that excitement, that energy, if you look at Saturday, it's clear that they're going to win, and no one seems to be able to score more points than Fleetwood or Molinari at The Golf National in the evening.
They may be in different places at the same time.
Europe is not yet fully developed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played quite well after scoring Force Balls played together by Sergio Garcia and Alex Naren.
The Spaniard and Sweden reached a hole they had never reached before, due to a bogey and two doubles in the front nine.
There's no one to help you in your house.
It's great to see fourballs and foursomes, because the interactions and advice between the pair can happen in a matter of seconds.
So far, Europe has played with a fantastic team spirit and is leading the way on Fine Day, but Team USA has also shown their mettle in today's foursomes session, especially on the state side.
On the last day of the Ryder Cup, Europe took a 10-6 lead
With a 10-6 lead in the four-balls and four-sums against the United States on Saturday, the European Team Rider Cup had a good advance on the final day.
At The Golf National so far, Tom Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have taken the lead with two wins by four points, driving some troubled Tiger Woods back.
European player Thom J<0xC3><0xB6>rn, who was desperate to regain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1 with the American side making the fourballs missfire in the morning.
The U.S. played well, winning two matches in the Four Sams, but they failed to dominate.
In order to retain the trophy, Jim Farrick needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches.
Fleetwood became the first European to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari became the second pair in Ryder Cup history to win the first four matches by four points in a row with a stunning "Mollywood" performance.
After defeating Woods, Patrick Reed, they defeated Woods and American Rookie Bryson Denchaby more effectively by 5&4.
Woods lost two matches in a row with his own mistakes on Sunday, and now he has lost 19 out of 29 matches in the fourballs and fours, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who played in the four balls in the morning, played with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Keepka 2&1, who are ranked one and three in the world.
It wasn't easy in Europe, it wasn't easy in the South West of Paris.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Tham set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
After they won 2&1 against John Reham and Ian Poultre of Spain, they won 4&3 against Poultre and Romay McLori, but lost the first two holes.
This is only the second time in the history of the Ryder Cup that a four-point deficit has made it to the singles, but Farick is trying to retain the trophy.
After being the second best team for two days, they played brilliantly in the counter-attack on Sunday.
North Korea says it is "impossible" to unilaterally withdraw weapons without full confidence
Speaking at the United Nations on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister said the continuation of sanctions against the United States would further discredit the country's position that it would not be possible to unilaterally withdraw its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
At the International Annual General Assembly last year, Ri Yang said North Korea had taken a number of "significant positive steps," including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling of the nuclear weapons facility, and promising to expand nuclear weapons and their technology.
"No action was seen from the U.S. side in accordance with this," he said.
"We can't have full confidence in our national security without having full confidence in the U.S. We can't have early withdrawal of arms under these circumstances."
By re-iterating their complaints to Washington and their opposition to North Korea's promise to help them by reducing their nuclear weapons "in a phased manner," Pyongyang recalled the incident in the past when Pyongyang rejected a proposal to withdraw nuclear weapons unilaterally.
In a joint statement issued after the first-ever meeting between the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Mr. Ri recalled Mr. Kim's "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" statement and Mr. Trump's "commitment to the security and stability of North Korea."
North Korea wants an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the U.S. wants its nuclear weapons to be denuclearized first.
Washington also rejected measures to lift the severe international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The U.S. is demanding that "first they withdraw their nuclear weapons," and is seeking to achieve this by imposing severe sanctions, and is not even releasing a "statement that the war is over".
"It's just that they don't want to know about us."
But we're still growing in confidence."
The U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations last week that a second meeting between Kim and Trump should take place, but Rice did not speak about it.
But, speaking of five meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, he said: "It wouldn't have been so difficult if there was a South Korea rather than the U.S. involved in the denuclearization."
Also, his tone was dramatic compared to Ri's statement at the U.N. General Assembly last year that after Kim committed suicide as "Rocket Man" and "Evil President," it was mandatory for North Korean missiles to target mainland U.S. territory.
Trump, in his speech at the UN last year, said he would "totally destroy" North Korea, and praised Kim's courage in now seeking to denuclearize, but said the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea completely withdraws its nuclear weapons.
"It doesn't matter if it takes two, three years or five months," Trump said Wednesday.
China and Russia have argued in the UN Security Council that Pyongyang should be given some relief based on the measures taken so far.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must remain strictly in place until we can confirm that North Korea has been fully and permanently denuclearized."
In 2006, the Security Council unanimously passed a resolution imposing sanctions on North Korea to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo, who met with Ri at the UN General Assembly, said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second round of talks.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
Pompeo, who arrived from Pyongyang in July, said his trip was well under way within hours of him saying that he "wants to be like a gangster."
In a meeting with Moon last month, North Korea said it would dismantle the missile and nuclear weapons facilities if the US took "the right steps."
He said Kim's intention was to "take the right steps" to guarantee security and build a good relationship with Washington, as Trump had said in Singapore.
Harvard students are being asked to take a break.
A new course at Harvard University began this year to teach students how to get enough rest at night.
Many students don't even know how to take care of their mental health.
Sleep pill specialists at Harvard Medical College, Charles Zeesler, and specialists at Brigham and Women's Hospital, began the first such training in the US.
He wanted to start this training after discussing the problems that arise in education due to lack of sleep.
“At the end of this training, a girl came up to me and asked: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Why did I teach this in my final year?’
"No one has told me the importance of sleep in the past, which is quite surprising," she told the Telegraph.
The training started in the year itself, and it shows how good sleep can improve education and sports as well as overall health.
Paul Bareira, professor at the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College, and executive director of the university's health services, said they decided to introduce the training after learning that students had been suffering from severe insomnia during the week.
The training will consist of an hour-long interactive task.
In one section, there will be a dormitory, where students will be given copy cups, curtains, trainers, and books to explain how coffee and light are causing the problem of sleep after clicking on them, how it is affecting performance in sports, and the benefits of getting enough sleep in a timely manner.
Another section describes how sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
They should discuss their day-to-day tasks on a campus map with interactive symbols.
"We don't think it will change the behavior of the students immediately.
But, it's people's right to know the effects of smoking, and it's their right to know, too," said Professor Zeesler.
There is already a habit of 'reading all night', he said, adding that due to modern technology and increasing pressure day by day, students are not able to sleep properly.
Sleeping at the right time and in the right manner can act as a 'secret weapon' for students, thus eliminating stress, depression and anxiety, as sleep deprivation pushes the brain into starvation mode, leading to constant hunger and weight gain, he said.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, who studied at Professor Geisler at Harvard last year, helped him design the training.
He said he was inspired by this training and wanted it to be extended to the entire university.
He said that all post-graduate students would like to complete such training before joining any competitive institute.
Professor Zeesler says that students should be alert not only to wake up, but also to go to sleep, as the 'blue light' from electronic screens and LED lighting can damage your circadian rhythm and lead to sleep-related problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Gerrard's team lost due to Menga goal
Steven Gerrard's side lost 1-0 to Rangers in Livingston due to a goal scored by Dolly Menga.
The IRBOX team was looking for their first win since a 4-1 win at St John's in February, but Gary Holt's team was a surprise as Gerrard lost for the second time in 18 games, losing his eight-point adrenaline in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga tried for 7 minutes before half-time, but Rangers were unable to put up a good fight.
The Rangers are now down to sixth, while Livingston is third with a goal difference.
Linesman's column was wound to the head because of a rapidly thrown object that caught fire, making it more of a problem for Rangers.
Gerrard made eight changes to his squad during the Beford Cup semi-finals after the match against Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, only played with the same Livy 11 who won everyone's hearts last week and played brilliantly, and he would have been thrilled to see every minute of the hard work put in by his opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated to some extent, but Livingston showed complete dominance when the ball was in their possession.
When Menga sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal for the first time, the midfielder gave up a good chance otherwise they would have scored within two minutes.
The ball arrived at Craig Halkett with a deep kick hit by Keegan Jacobs, but his defensive partner, Allen Lithgow, hit it away at the back post.
The Rangers held on, but in the final third they seemed to have played with hope rather than confidence.
The quarter-hour mark was then considered by Alfredo Morelos to be a penalty at the time he and Steven Lawless collided, but the appeal by the Colombians was rejected by the referee Steven Thomson.
The Rangers were only able to hit two first-half shots, but the header made by Lasana Coulibaly and the Tame Ovi Ezaria strike were easily intercepted by former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
In the 34th minute, everyone thought they had a chance to score.
The Rangers failed again because of Deep Jacobs set-pieces.
Scott R Field was not there when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who scored Menga's goal with ease.
Guerra replaced Ryan Kent during the break, and the change seemed to benefit to some extent when the ball came to Morales, although Kelly stopped abruptly.
Livingston continued to impress Lithgow and Halkett Sweepstakes in a way that was well-liked by visitors.
Holtside may have maintained their lead in the final stages, but McGroger prevented Jacobs from moving from Corner to Lithgow.
Even Glen Middleton, who was a sub-inspector for Rangers, turned down Thompson's request for a penalty when he collided with Jacobs.
Panchangam: The creator of the Gaiger counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Panchangam: September 30, 1882, which means 136 years ago today ... Future physicist future future future Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method of detecting and predicting radiation that eventually became a device called the Geiger Counter.
The Guyger counter is not only a major science device, but also has a name in pop culture, first used in 1950 in the film Bells of Coronado, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as scientists:
Man: "What in the world is this?"
Rogers: "It detects radioactive minerals such as geyser counter, uranium."
If these earphones are worn, it will identify the sounds coming from the molecules due to the radioactivity present in the minerals."
Eavens: "Oh, now the sound is coming!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his legacy will live on forever.
How to 'identify' bad cells with a new cancer vaccine can tell the immune system
A new cancer vaccine can tell the immune system how to 'identify' bad cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
As part of the process, the immune cells are collected from the patient's body and converted into them in a laboratory.
They then "identify" the protein, which is common in many types of cancer, and then inject it back into the bloodstream
The trial vaccine has yielded positive results in patients with a wide variety of cancers.
If a woman was treated with a vaccine that informed the immune system of the detection of bad cells, she would have had ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This involves collecting immune cells from a patient's body, training them to "identify" a protein called HER2 in most types of cancer, and then injecting it back.
Professor Jay Bearjafski, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that our vaccine can work well."
Professor Bearjafsky explained that "many types of cancer are on the rise" due to HER2, along with breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.
In treatment of leukemia, a similar method of "learning" has been used to collect immune cells and attack cancer cells.
Kanye West was seen wearing a mega-hat after his SNL performance at the Pro-Trump Diatribe.
It didn't go well.
Fans surrounded Kanye West in the studio after a lengthy appearance on Saturday Night Live praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying that he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, that night wearing a hat called Make America Great, he was once again critical of the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
"Many times when I talked to white people I was asked: "Trump discriminates against white people, how did you support him?"
"Well, I used to think about racial discrimination but I moved out of the US a long time ago," he said.
SNL began with a skit starring Hollywood actor Matt Damon, in which he sat in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee as Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even if it wasn't broadcast, only comedian Chris Rock's criticism of West was uploaded on social media.
It's clear that the West is going to take it by storm.
However, West also told his fans that he was having trouble in the back of the stage because of his hat.
"They have disgraced me.
He said, "Don't wear that."
They've ruined me!
"I'm in the middle of the ocean," he said.
West said: "Do you see the sinking boat?" He said, "I wear my Superman hat, which means they don't have to tell me what I'm supposed to do. Do you want the world to go forward?
Bring on the love."
The audience was booed twice because of his comments, and the SNL crew felt humiliated, and one who was there said: "The whole studio went silent."
Singer Ariana Grande, who was mourning the death of her boyfriend Mac Miller, was replaced by West at the last minute.
Dressed like a pirate bottle, the singer of I Love It song surprised everyone in the West.
Kandas Turner, head of the Conservative group TPUSA in support of West, tweeted: "To one of the most courageous: Thank you for speaking out boldly for the people."
But, West was just "dealing with what he likes, which is awesome," the talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted.
"But I have chosen not to allow anyone (by buying his music or his clothing or his "art") to make any financial gain who supports an ideology that could be a danger to my community."
He has freedom.
We have freedom," he said.
Before the show, he announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying, "Now he's called Kanye West."
Many artists changed their names after Diddy changed his name to what is now known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was known as Snoop Lion, as well as the iconic musician Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, before him being called Prince.
A case of attempt to murder has been registered
A 45-year-old woman was booked for assaulting a man with a knife at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Mumbai, police said.
The accused will be produced before the court on Monday.
The Public Prosecution Service will review the charges.
Kit Harington has been critical of Game of Thrones actors over toxic masculinity
Kitt played the role of sword-fighting John Snow in HBO's Wild Medieval Fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor said that the youngsters were misled into thinking that the stereotype that is seen in the movies might not be the same in real life due to the role of the macho hero.
Speaking to The Sunday Time Culture, he said, "Something has gone wrong" and how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity at a time when the <0x23>MeToo controversy is going on.
Kitt recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Ross Leslie, who is also 31 years old, and she says he "thinks very seriously" about the issue.
“Personally I am fine, but what about the society towards masculinity?” he said.
'What are we teaching our children about the problems we are currently facing?'
Kitt said that television may be responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity and the rise in popularity of masculinity roles.
He said, "What are we going to learn?
Is it possible for people to watch TV in the same way they watch TV?
How to deal with this is one of the most important questions we have.
It is clear that there is something wrong with the youth.'
The series will be completed in the summer of next year, after which I will not act in Game of Thrones sequels or prequels, "starring in wars and horses is enough," he added.
Sam Shepard's True West is about to re-release from the kit number, a story about a filmmaker and his brother, plus the fact that he's also a bandit.
He said that meeting my wife in Game of Thrones was a wonderful thing.
"I met my wife at the event, which means I have my family, and I will continue to do this," he said.
Rose played the role of Yegritte, who loves John Snow, who played Kit in the Emmy-award-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
China's new HIV/AIDS cases rise by 14%
China has reported that the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in our country has increased by 14%.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people across the country have been affected by the virus.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases were reported.
Unlike in the past, most of them were sexually transmitted.
Traditionally, however, the disease has been transmitted by transfusion of infected blood in certain parts of China.
However, Chinese health officials said at a meeting in Yunnan province that the number of people infected in this way has almost reached zero.
Every year, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS is growing by 100,000 in China.
Sexual harassment is a serious problem in the LGBT community.
Homosexuality was declared a criminal offence in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT has only increased.
Because of the country's traditional values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Many of these relationships are infected by the disease due to lack of proper protection in the context of sexual activity.
As part of addressing this problem, the Chinese government has been providing HIV drugs to everyone since 2003.
Maxine Waters denied that one of the crew members leaked the data of the GOP Senators, calling them "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories."
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff posted the personal information of Republican U.S. Senators on the Lakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the "ultra-right wing" pundits were making the news on the website.
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: "Lies, lies, green lies."
US Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah and Orin Hatch of Utah have house addresses and phone numbers, according to the release.
The information was posted online by an unidentified man on Capitol Hill at the time of the Senate panel hearing allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
"Conservatives such as Gateway Pandit and Wed State released the information by one of the Waters staffers, citing that the IP address that leaked this information was from Waters' office," Hill said.
"This claim is completely unfounded," he said.
"Due to these baseless allegations, the identity and personal information of one of my staff members has become completely public, but this has nothing to do with the person.
This denial is completely unfounded."
Several people, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, have criticised the Waters statement online.
"She's furious," wrote Fleischer.
"She doesn't seem to have the temperament to continue as a member of the Congress.
No one will be angry at them, no one will be upset with them.
They should not be attacked.
They should not question the motives of the accused person.
They should be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer compared Waters' response and the comments of Democrats who said Kavanaugh was "very angry" during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro has announced on Twitter that he wants to replace Waters in the midterm elections.
"If that's true, it's a great thing," he said.
"We have informed the relevant authorities and legal entities about these fraudulent allegations," Waters said in a statement.
"We will catch the persons who have leaked", she said, "this has caused a lot of trouble not only to me but also to my staff, so we will punish the responsible sternly and legally".
Johnny English Strikes Again <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Rowan Atkins Spiegel
In recent years, Brexit has been mentioned in almost all British films with a British splendour, such as Johnny English, a series that began with Johnny English in 2003 and continued in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
If we think about it, how much do we really think about the economy as a whole?
However, the inept Johnny English with a middle-aged, rubbery face is a humorous character designed for non-English speaking movie lovers who are now facing the audience for a second time.
He is portrayed as a daft secret agent, with his peculiar behaviors trying to make him look like some sort of closeia, i.e., a Mr. Bean-like character, which helped to some extent during the Chariot of Fire theme during the 2012 London Olympics.
In fact, it is based on the travel, International Man of Misery Atkinson, which was featured in the past Bar Clacard TV commercials, but people have forgotten it because of its lack of properness.
There are a couple of good ones in the Jetta.
I was lucky enough to get to see Johnny English in a helicopter, dressed in medieval clothing, swords and helmets.
The Atkinson Prize is now seen as a form of physical comedy, but it's not very good at all, and there's also comedy in the "series" of films these days, such as 007, Mission Impossible.
It's a comedy designed not for adults but for children, in my opinion Atkinson's Silente-Movie featured Bean's personality, but Johnny's mad antics in English were not very impressive.
The saddest thing about this story is that Great Britain is now in trouble.
A cyber hacker broke into Britain's Spyle Super Secret Web Network, passed information on all British agents to an agent in an enemy country, threatening a on-duty agent, a minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the biggest problem for the prime minister, who is already facing a complete political backlash: Emma Thompson played the role of Quasi Theresa May wonderfully, but her role in the script was not of much importance.
All of the active spies have been compromised, and her intelligence advisors suggest that she should be brought in from someone who has retired.
It's none other than our Johnny English, who is now working as a schoolmaster and teaching children lessons on how to become an undercover spy: The fun here is that he teaches spy lessons at a rock-type academy.
English is immediately brought to the White Hall for an emergency meeting, where he reunites with his old side kick bouncer, played by Ben Miller.
Bowie is now married, serving as a submarine commander, and the Jolly-Hockey-Sticks character in Vicky Pepper Dine is somewhat less well-liked.
The Batman, who always makes mistakes in the Queen's Secret Service, returns to Robin, where Olga meets the beautiful Ophelia Bulletova of Curielenko.
Meanwhile, Lake Lacey plays the role of Jason Volta, a handsome tech billionaire who dreams of solving computer hacking problems in Britain.
Both English and Bow perform a variety of stunts, work as waiters and set fire to a French restaurant, are smuggled into Volta's luxury yacht, and English Nana, who wears virtual reality to find out about Volta's home, creates confusion.
It's all set up for a lost sequence, no matter how cute and outrageous it is, it's all like a children's TV.
A good model stand.
I can't remember much of the other Johnny English films, but does the British film industry really do justice to his talent in the role of Atkinson?
Labour said it was not looking at a plan to allow employees in the UK to work for four days and earn five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a new plan that would allow UK workers to work for four days and receive five days' pay.
The company is asking employers to distribute the money saved through artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them one-day extra leave.
Employees are entitled to three days off a week, but that doesn't make a difference in salary.
It's 'enough' for the party's economic agenda, and the country as a whole will turn out to be supportive of the workers.
The union has also said that the four-day work week will benefit the workers.
A senior Labour leader told The Sunday Times: "The policy will be reviewed before the end of the year.
“It doesn’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a party policy, through which employees can benefit while maintaining a balance in the economic sphere, so that the industry plan for Paris also succeeds.”
The Greens are the first party to support the idea since the 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party does not support this idea.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not the party's policy, it is not the party's consideration.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell presented his idea for a social revolution in the economic sector at a Labour conference last week.
McDonald's said it would take back power from "invisible directors" and "profit-takers" in utility companies.
The chancellor also said that the Labour government may impose "cuts" based on wrong decisions and that the shareholders currently in the water companies may not get back shares at the same level.
He also said that the company should put employees on board and set up comprehensive ownership funds in private companies with an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 and give 10 per cent stake to employees.
The FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations may have changed their minds, as Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy informed "60 Minutes."
The FBI investigation into the allegations delayed the vote on Bret Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, with the Bureau investigating whether any of the Republican Senators supported it.
Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy were questioned by "60 Minutes" spokesman Scott Pillay in an interview Sunday.
Kennedy spoke more clearly than his Collegiate from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I was talking to Kevin when he died.
"After the accusation, I called him up and said, ""Did you do that?"""
He was brave, strong and brave."
Graham is the only one with a consistent view.
He said: "It's not going to be easy and it's not going to be easy.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett condemned it seriously," Graham said.
We can't blame him for everything he says.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what does it mean to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival is set to take place in New York this Saturday, as part of which many stars will not only perform but also raise awareness about poverty alleviation in the world.
This is the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival in Great Lawn, Central Park, will feature the performances of stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, Shawn Mendes, and how to eliminate the world's most extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival was launched in 2012 as a follow-up to the Global Poverty Project, which aims to fight poverty on a global scale.
If you want to get a free ticket (unless you want a VIP ticket), you can do a few tasks or "acts" at the event, such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, making a phone call, or in some other way raising awareness about poverty.
With only 12 more years to go to reach the target, how far has the Global Citizen succeeded now?
Do they really think that giving free tickets to phone callers is going to help, or is it just a matter of signing petitions online or sending tweets through "click-tvism"?
Global Citizen says it has recorded 19 million "actions" from its supporters since 2011, with several reaching those goals.
These measures have resulted in a number of promises and policies by world leaders, including a $37 billion package to help 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, they said up to $10 billion had been disbursed or raised through 390 guarantees and advertising because of their actions.
So far, 649 million people around the world have benefited from secure funding.
Some of the key promises were that after more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, The Power of Nutrition, investors and implementers in the U.K. promised to pay $35 million to undernourished Rwanda, saying they would "provide proper nutrition for the children."
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like us, we can eradicate the social injustice of malnutrition," said Tracer Ulman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, in a live concert in April 2018.
After taking more than 5,000 steps to improve U.K. nutrition, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition, a program that would provide 5 million women and children with proper nutrition.
Why do you think that one of the FAQs on their website is “Can Extreme Poverty Be Eliminated?” in response to a question
"It's a long, hard road, sometimes we fall down, sometimes we fail.
But, like the movements for rights and the struggle against apartheid in the past, we will win with a very powerful unity.
This year's event in New York will feature performances by Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae, who will be hosted by Deborah Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US uses its navy to "block" Russia energy exports <0xE2><0x80><0x93> Interior Secretary
Washington will use its navy to prevent Russia from entering markets such as the Middle East "if necessary," said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of State for the Interior.
Russia is actively involved in Syria in order to reach new energy markets, he said.
"Russia wants to sell its energy in Southern Europe, just as it does in Eastern Europe, so it wants to enter the Middle East," he said.
According to him, there are several ways to deal with this.
"The U.S. Navy has the capability to open and close sea lanes when needed, to prevent energy from entering those markets," he said.
Jinke made the remarks at an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an NGO that claims to be an "energy consumer organization" in the US.
He said there was no change in Washington's relations with Russia and Iran.
"Iran and Russia both make almost all of their money from the sale of energy," he said, adding that Russia is a country that is almost entirely based on fossil fuels.
The comments come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to sell its liquid natural gas to replace Russia's in Europe, but it is the cheapest available to European consumers.
For this, the whole of his administration, including Trump, has been pressing for Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which he said was a project "held" by Berlin Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly said that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline to double the current capacity of 110 billion cubic meters is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin said Washington's attempt to block the project was purely in economic interests and not competitive.
"We should not put pressure on consumers using energy products, they should have the right to choose the suppliers of their choice," said Alexander Novak, Russia's energy minister, after a tense meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. rejected Germany's offer, concluding that we would continue with the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the German Industry Confederation (BDI), has stated that the US should not interfere in the EU's energy policy and avoid them in the ongoing bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After a tense meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the President of the German Industry Association (BDI) Dieter Kemp said, "We do not like a third country interfering in our energy supply".
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says there is "a chance" of participating in the 2020 presidential election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday there was "a chance" of participating in the 2020 presidential election after the midterm elections.
Warren has confirmed that she will be able to run in the election in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"Women should be allowed to enter Washington, fix our chaotic government, and prioritize women," she said.
"After November 6, I will think about the presidential election."
"Trump is taking our country in the wrong direction.
"Trump is destroying our democracy," she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and the Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh.
"The FBI needs an investigation before voting," she said in a tweet on Friday.
A survey released on Thursday showed that many in Warren's own constituency think she won't run in the 2020 election.
According to the University of Suffolk's Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey, 58% of Massachusetts voters who said "maybe" she should not be running.
Thirty-two percent supported it.
Former governor Deval Patrick received the most support in the survey, with 38 percent saying probably, while 48 percent opposed.
The names of other prominent Democrats, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, are under discussion for the 2020 election.
"I will make a formal decision in January," Biden was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin, who participated in Trump's rally, referred to track Palin's PTSD
The 26-year-old track record holder has been in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence
"I understand the kind of situation my son is in, the kind of problems he will have when he comes back home, and the post-PTSD consequences for some of our soldiers who have served our country," she told a Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
His arrest was called a "white elephant in the room," and even if he was his son and other war heroes would be "very different and strict" when they returned, leaving them and their fellow soldiers and their families in doubt whether or not they would get the respect they deserved for their sacrifice for this country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday, following a report of assault on a woman, involvement in a domestic violence case and the use of alcohol-intoxicating weapons, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department, Dan Bennett, said.
In the new refugee policy, 18 states are supporting litigation against the D.C.
English states and the District of Columbia are legally challenging the new policy designed to prevent those who are victims of gang strife or domestic violence from entering the U.S.
Representatives from 18 states and one district are supporting cases filed in Washington on behalf of refugees protesting the new policy, NBC News reported.
The names of those who filed a case in August against federalism under the name of American Civil Liberties Union in Grace v. Sessions are not known.
My husband and the "sons of his brutal gang member" sexually harassed me, but on July 20, U.S. officials turned down my request for asylum.
She was arrested in Texas.
The attorney who supports Grace said many are applying to be U.S. refugees from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of whom have been victims of gang clashes and domestic violence.
This new policy reversed the 2014 refugee policy that allowed victims of domestic violence to seek asylum in the U.S. without documentation.
The new policy "ignored decades of state, federal, and international law," General Carl Rasch, the District Attorney of Columbia, said on Friday.
"According to federal law, when an incident is reported to have taken place, it is mandatory to prove that the incident took place and the rules were violated," the court said.
This policy of denying refugees damages the U.S. economy, which has the potential to become a dumping ground for merchants and "labor in need of supplies."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions urged the court not to allow those who come as victims of domestic violence and gang clashes in June.
"Only those who come because of violence or intimidation on account of race, religion, nationality or position of a particular social group or political opinion should be considered refugees," Sessions said.
The refugee policy is not designed for the problems that occur every day around the world, not even the most serious problems are taken into account.
The death toll in Palu is on the rise and the search for the survivors is on
The condition of the injured is worsening.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother at a rehabilitation center in Palu, took hold of a child with a fever and said, "The situation is changing very rapidly."
"Every minute, bodies are coming in ambulances.
There's no drinking water."
The locals are trying to get their belongings back to their homes where the water is trapped and if anything goes wrong, they will do so.
Hundreds of people were injured as a result of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
Due to vibrations even after the earthquake, they were treated outside the military hospital in Palu, so one of the people waiting outside the hospital was Dwy Harris, who had a broken spine and a fractured shoulder.
He was found dead in his hotel room on the fifth floor with his wife and daughter.
"We don't have time to protect ourselves.
"I'm stuck between the walls," Harris told The Associated Press, "We came to this city to attend a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then everything went silent.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they will be okay."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of 'disgraceful' with 'propaganda ads'
A week ago in the U.S. daily, the Chinese official newspaper published a four-page statement outlining the benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, alleging that the U.S. ambassador in China was promoting a propaganda campaign using American newspapers.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a payment announcement published by the Chinese daily newspaper Des Monis Register, the most widely published newspaper in the state of Loa, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China has denied.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election as part of Washington's efforts to put more pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish advertisements to boost business, Washington and Beijing are currently raising tariffs on each other's imports in a phased manner.
Chinese and U.S. experts have said the tariffs, which were initially raised as part of China's retaliatory measures, have had an impact on exporters in states such as Lova, which have backed Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, currently the U.S. ambassador to China, has long been the governor of Lova, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, but he said the U.S. workers, farmers, and businesses were suffering because of China.
Writing in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, he said, "China is now complicating the problem further by using our own freedom of expression to publish propaganda."
"China is using the US-priority of freedom of the press and expression to push its propaganda out of the country, and therefore is publishing paid advertisements in the American press.
"In stark contrast, in Beijing, there is virtually no freedom of the press, and no one can openly express their views on the economic problems in China, as many newspapers are caught up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.
"One of the most prominent newspapers in China refused to publish my story," he said, but did not name the paper.
Analysts warn that Republicans are turning away women voters in the midterm elections because of the Kavanaugh controversy
Many Republicans have spoken out in support of Bret Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault, and have warned that it would be a setback for them and alienate women voters in the midterm elections.
There is a lot of controversy over this, and many Republicans have already said they would vote for it.
Such things can't be fixed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of compromise science at Maxwell School at Syracuse University.
Reiher suspected that it might be to appease angry voters by asking Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday, today, tomorrow, and November," said Karen Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn.
"Republicans pressured the Judiciary Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination, ignoring the allegations made by Dr. Christine Blossom Ford, and protesters in the Hallway of the Senate chanted ""November is coming!"" on Friday morning," Mike said.
"The enthusiasm and spirit of the Democrats continues behind the scenes," non-parties political analyst Stu Rothenberg told a news site.
"Everyone says it's already getting worse; it's true.
But it could still grow, especially in the suburban, 18- to 29-year-old age group, which has a huge impact on young female voters, who generally wouldn't vote at all if they didn't like the president."
Analysts said Republicans would have a greater impact if they continued to confirm Kavanaugh, Ford's nominee for the Supreme Court, before he was sexually assaulted.
"It's made like a mess at the GOP," former President Michael Steele told the Republican National Committee early last week, according to NBC News.
"Whether the committee votes or casts a final vote or Kavanaugh on the bench is not the real issue, and the manner in which she has been treated in the Republican Party about this issue is not right at all," said G Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps select Democrats, when speaking to a news channel.
However, among Americans who have seen Ford and Cavanaugh's statements, there is disagreement over the controversy, perhaps even more than most believe.
A new survey conducted by YouGov found that 41 percent of participants believed Ford to be true, while 35 percent believed it to be true.
Similarly, only 38 percent believe he is lying, and 30 percent say Ford is lying.
According to The Guardian, at Flake's request, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and another man named Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he sexually assaulted me when I was 17 years old.
Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of showing his genitals to her when he went to a party in Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is expected to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source platform, is being developed at a company called Inrupt.
In Solid, users can decide where their data should be stored and who should have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt was created to "rule the world."
He said, "You have to do it now."
"This is a historic event."
Solid technology is used in the app, through which users can create their own "Personal Online Data Store" or POD.
This includes contact lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
This means that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in the same browser at the same time.
What makes a personal online store special is that users can decide who has access to their information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
John Bruce, the company's CEO, said in a statement: "Inrupt is designed to create the resources, process, and niche skills needed to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently has a security platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce from IBM, some on-staff workers working on the project in contract form, some volunteer coders.
Since this inception, technology developers around the world have been designing decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
"I and my team didn't talk to them until they decided whether or not to launch a project that could completely transform the business models of Facebook and Google overnight," Berners-Lee said.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt is working to "provide the commercial energy and ecosystem needed to protect the integrity and quality of the new web that will be created on Solid."
Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet by launching the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been at the forefront of Net Neutrality discussions over the past few months.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic for the web era to come," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Remembered WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric
Clark was the only English church to win the Victoria Cross during World War I, so it is now a celebration, 100 years after the event.
The award was given to Lt. Col. Bernard von for the attack on Bellenglis and Lehakort on 29 September 1918.
Four days later, however, he was shot dead by a sniper, unaware that at least he had been awarded the highest British military honour.
His two grandsons opened a memorial in his memory in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One grandson, Michael Wan, says he started the memorial as a "beautiful symbol" exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, he carried his battalion through the Canal de Saint Quentin "amidst thick smoke and loads of machine guns."
Immediately thereafter he went to the front line and fired with "magnificent gallantry" and with one hand knocked down three detachments.
On 4 October 1918, just months before the end of the war, von Neumann was killed by a German sniper.
"I know some of our grandfather's adventures, such adventures I can't do, but I would be proud if I could head them," said Michael Vann, 72, his grandson.
He and his brother, Dr. James, also placed a wreath at the parade, featuring the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"It was a pleasure to participate in the parade", Michael Wan said, "so many people supported that true hero and remembered his services once again."
MMA fans waited all night to see the Belator 206, but they saw the Peppa Pig instead
Just imagine, you refused to watch the main event after you had to wait all night to see Packed Belter 206.
The bill from San Jose included 13 aircraft, as well as six in the mail card and nightly live broadcasts on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were almost face to face when the coverage suddenly turned into a Peppa Pig.
Many were disappointed, especially those who waited until morning to board the plane.
Let's look at a children's cartoon, "It's a big joke," said one fan on Twitter.
"It's not the right content to show at 6 a.m. as a government rule, so it's showing a children's show," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Pop music, yeah.
"We will adjust our timings keeping the future UK audience in mind as well," said Scott Cocker, president of the Bellator Company.
"I think we can do it," Walker said.
"Now that it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning, we can't work on this until our time comes Sunday, which means it's Monday in their time."
But we are working on it.
Trust me, when it comes down to it, there are a lot of things that don't make sense.
We are trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical issue.
But this is not the government's problem.
I assure you that it will not happen again.
Rather than the six hours we normally show for, say, five hours, we wanted to show off heavily, lastly becoming empty.
It is a sad situation."
Deseret Island Discs: Tom Daley Is Considered 'Inferior' About Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up with inferiority because of his sexuality from a young age, but he was able to succeed because of it.
"I didn't know everyone was like me until I went to secondary school," the 24-year-old said.
Speaking at First Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, I spoke out publicly to bring hope to others.
"I didn't care much about the Olympics when I became a father.
For a very long time, the Klingon people have been suffering from this disease.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD>, who attended Laverne's first show as a castaway, said that I was "less" than anyone else, and that as a child I "thought that if I wasn't like the boys and girls, society wouldn't accept me".
He said, "Today, I have lost the feeling of being less than everyone else, that I am not like everyone else, that I have got real strength and strength and with that I have succeeded."
I wanted to prove that there was something in me, he said, so no one was disappointed when he told me about his sexuality.
A two-time Olympic bronze-medallist, he became a leading LGBT campaigner and participated in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge more countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that living without any candidness is a gift and this is the "hope" that I want to pass on to others and speak out for all.
"It took me by surprise that three-time world champion I met in 2013 a U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black fell in love with a man named Dustin Lance Black.
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> married an Oscar winner who was 20 years older than him and his age was never an issue between us, he said.
"It was all seen at a young age" - he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14, so it was hard to find someone who was the same age and had the same problems as me, he said.
In June, a couple gave birth to a baby boy named Robert Ray Black Daley, after which Daley said that his "focus point" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my focus would have been on winning the gold medal," he said.
"You know there are things that are more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal."
Dal<0xC3><0xAD> named his son Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Dale said that his father had not been able to digest his death, and one of his last questions was whether he still had tickets for the London 2012 Olympics - and that he wanted to sit in line in front of him.
I told him, "You can't be my dad."
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and I didn't accept that he had a defeat until he actually stopped breathing completely," she said.
The following year, he competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I know all my life that it's been about what I've been dreaming about - diving in front of the compatriots at the Olympic Games, not feeling any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud by Heather Small - which inspired his Olympic practice, still haunting him to this day.
About Desert Island Discs comes on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Michael Sun was unable to play in the Ryder Cup on Saturday as he was out of form
American Phil Mickelson will set a record with his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to come back into form if that doesn't turn out to be a tragic milestone.
Michaelson, who was playing his 12th double-header, was sidelined by captain Jim Furyk at the Four Balls and Four Sams on Saturday.
He was never a key player on the United States team, having scored five key victories, dividing his day between being a cheerleader and improving the game to correct his flaws in his range.
One of the drivers who didn't play directly even at the peak of his career was 48-year-old Michaelson, who was not ideal for the tight Le Golf National Course, where a field that used to be a long rough would be awkward for shots going down a curve.
If that wasn't enough, Michaelson will face precision British Open champion Francisco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, which he will team up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points short, start 12 singles matches and give a fantastic start, Michaelson's match will prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, which doesn't mean he can't say more.
"He understood his role perfectly today," Furyk said, "and he said he'd hug me and be ready for tomorrow."
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's brought a great name to these teams in the past, as well as this week.
I don't think he's going to play two games.
I thought it would work, but we kept going.
He wanted to be there for everyone."
Michael Jackson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most runs in a Ryder Cup match on Sunday.
This could be the end of his illustrious career.
Although Furyk said his presence added intangible elements to the team, Michaelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries.
"He's fun, he's sarcastic, witty, he likes to entertain people, and being in the room gives him good fun," he explained.
"I think it's fun for young players to criticize him, and I think it's fun to watch, too, this week."
He's not just playing."
Thomas Jorne, the European captain, knew that a great leadership would soon come to an end.
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn knows from experience that a significant lead that goes into singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily become uncomfortable.
Dane made his debut in a Valderrama match in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans, but only reached the finish line with a nosebleed, which the Americans won by a narrow margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we have a big lead at Valderrama; at Brookline, where we lost, and we have a big lead at Valderrama that we won," said Jorne, who led 10-6 at Le Golf National, winning 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday after watching the 2018 class.
So history shows me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
You will be able to use your full potential.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, it's to try to win this trophy, so the focus should be on that.
I always say, I will focus on the 12 players on our side, but on the other side, we know we have some of the best players in the world."
Delighted at his players' performance on the rough golf course, Jorne said: "I can't pass myself up in this regard.
Tomorrow is another test.
Tomorrow's show will be different.
It's great to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're there in person, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
"The message to all the players is to give their best performance tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner and let him go and play by himself to the best of his ability."
Unlike Jordon, rival Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better in person than they did in partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was one of the two teams to have performed miracles on the final day, as part of the winning team at Brookline, who was the player who suffered a defeat in the European side due to the dismissal of "Miracle at Medina."
In 1999 when Captain Ben Crenshaw was asked how he assembled his players for the final day of the tournament, he replied: "I remember every damn thing about it."
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you're willing to start as fast as you've seen in Brookline and Medina.
When that speed continues, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in between.
"We've got to get the ball rolling, and if we're going to do it tomorrow, we're going to do it the right way."
An attempt to lead the fightback was handed to Thomas, who will face Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter among other Europeans in the first half of the order.
"The reason I didn't put these guys in this order is because I thought it was good in all aspects," Bjorn said of his singles options.
Germany's new warship launch has been postponed once again
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be launched in 2014 to replace outdated Cold War-era warships, but local media reported that it would not happen until at least next year due to the lackluster systems and increasing cost.
The Rheinland-Falz Commission, the flagship ship of the newest Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit quoted a military spokesman as saying.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery issues changed the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates that the Navy re-ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Among their features are anti-aircraft range and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
One of the other important features is long maintenance periods - it is possible to deploy the newest warships from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay meant that the state-of-the-art warships - the power Germany wanted to show abroad - were already outdated by the time they entered service, Die Zeit said.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Bloem & Voss Shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the completed vessel has been returned to the shipyard by the Navy.
Very little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that would render the battleship useless if used in combat.
Software errors were critical as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships were operated by a crew of about 120 sailors who were only half of the manpower on the old Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship's weight was dramatically increased, which would impair its performance and limit its ability to add updates to the Navy's fleet in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Falz" is said to weigh more than twice as much as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from hardware that is prone to defects, the cost of the entire project - including staff training - is also becoming an issue.
It started at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion and reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion).
In the wake of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking, the issue of new warships has gained importance.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "decreasing the number of expansion-capable ships."
The official said the problem had become serious over time, as older ships had been scrapped but no replacement ships had been provided.
He regretted that none of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class battleships could join the Navy.
The National Trust on the Secret Life of Bats
New research is being done on an estate in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use physical environments to hunt for food.
These results are expected to inform new findings regarding the behavior of distinguished flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists study the common and soprano pipitrels at the Invereve Gardens in West Ross, as well as brown long-eared and dabenton bats.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the study area to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also do mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
A skillful acoustic analysis of all recordings establishes the severity of bat chirping and what species are doing.
A Habitat map and report will be generated to create a comprehensive landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor for NTS, hopes that these results will reveal which areas are most important to bats and how they are useful to each species.
This information will help to find out the benefits of habitat management tasks, from forming grasses to maintaining woodlands for bats and other allied species.
The population of bats throughout Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the past century.
They are said to be in danger due to roosts and building and development works affecting habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and certain chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
The bees aren't really stingy.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to detect worms and obstructions in the way they fly.
More than 270 historic buildings, 38 important plantations, and 76,000 hectares of land around the country are considered by the NTS to be the most critical for bats.
They have ten trained professionals who do surveys, inspections, and sometimes rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Thrive Estate in Dunfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, said the estate was the perfect home for them.
He said: "We've got a lot of good players here.
"We have old buildings, a large number of trees and all good habitats.
But there is still a lot we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and at other research sites will be useful in understanding more of what things they still need to thrive in."
He stressed the importance of checking for bats before undertaking maintenance at a place, as unintentionally destroying a roost could result in the death of 400 female bats and children, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats have legal protection and it is illegal to kill, harass, or disturb them or destroy their roosts.
Elisabeth Ferrer, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, was also involved in helping people.
She said: "There is still a lot we need to know about our bats and we don't know how their population is growing relative to most species."
Ronaldo, who has filed a lawsuit against the German newspaper over the rape allegations, has denied the allegations
Cristiano Ronaldo used his name to say "they want to promote" and denied the rape allegations against him, calling them "false news."
His lawyers are ready to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward were accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayoruga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
A few hours after the allegations, Instagram said in a video for its 142 million followers that the 33-year-old Ronaldo had called it "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
Everything they've said today is false," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to use my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm glad everything went well," he said, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit over the allegations, which they say are "a report of unacceptable suspicions regarding personal privacy," Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would seek "moral damages in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent times."
The incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Ares Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a night club according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room where he raped her.
Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident, claiming that he was "99 percent" a "good person" because of the "one percent" mistake, Mayorga said.
The documents said Ronaldo had admitted to having sex between the two, but that it had been done with the consent of both.
Mayorga also said she went to the police, saying the hospital had photos of her taken for injuries, but later said she would "take revenge" and, fearing "insults," agreed to an out-of-court settlement.
The 34-year-old Mayorga said she wants to withdraw the settlement due to mental anguish over the incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the attack, and joined the Italian giants' Juve team this summer on a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: 'The UK will forever regret the loss of the carmaker'
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK "will forever be regretful" if it loses its position as a global leader in car manufacturing post-Brexit.
Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Barneston, near Derby, if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker has said that any small delay in the no-deal Brexit event could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Barneston plant - which manufactures the Toyota Arrows and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will take action to stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have expressed fears over leaving the EU without a deal over how the trade across borders would work, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would shut down its mini-plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the major concerns that car manufacturers have expressed is the supply chain disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production process is running on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU, completing car orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption at the border, which the industry says will lead to delays and shortages in reaching parts of cars.
The company said it was impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, thus halting production.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan regarding the EU's future relations with the bloc was "certainly designed to avoid such difficulties at the border."
“We have to have a deal. Not only do we get to enjoy this opportunity, we realize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
"The evidence from manufacturers other than Toyota is that we need to continue to have a successful plan for supply chains."
Toyota was unable to say for how long production would be halted, but said that any further costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsullaran, who worked at Barneston for 24 years and was a United Union convener at the plant, and his members were concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We will prepare an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein is likely to be delayed again.
Donald Trump's high-pitched meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein "can be postponed by another week," the White House said Sunday, as the Supreme Court battle over nominee Brett Kavanaugh continued.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian election interference, links between Trump supporters and Russia, and obstruction of justice by the president.
Over the past few months, there has been debate over whether Trump's removal of the deputy attorney general would affect Mueller's freedom.
The New York Times reported earlier this month that Stein discussed the possibility of wearing wire to record conversations with Trump and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
The report was denied by Rosenstein.
On Monday, he went to the White House with the news that he was resigning.
Instead, he announced a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to remove Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid confrontation with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing later in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh and further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set, and this week, the Supreme Court will likely adjourn for another week because of other matters."
But we'll see and I'm always willing to provide up-to-date details to the press."
That argument may not be accepted by some reporters: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Chrissy asked why.
Sanders said that not providing news to TV reporters was not their "grandstanding," but she added: "I don't disagree with the notion that they are superior.
She said she would like to see more direct connections between the two.
"The president has done more Q&A sessions than any president before him," she added without giving any evidence: "We've seen those numbers."
Sanders said the briefings would still take place, but "if the journalist had the opportunity to question the President of the United States directly, he would have done much better than talking to me."
We try to make that happen a lot, and you've seen a lot of what we've been doing over the last few weeks, and when you can talk to the President of the United States it will replace one press briefing position."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries who have come to meet him.
It's not enough to have a press conference.
In New York this week, he explained why the president probably doesn't follow the rules and is live in front of reporters without any information.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland, expressing their desire to remain with them after Brexit.
Jean Freeman sent an MSP letter six months before the UK was due to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay the cost of settled applications for EU citizens working in the service sectors where its division took place.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal are ongoing, and we are on the way to making decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for the possible no-deal scheme.
I know this is a difficult time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that the contribution of every member of the staff, irrespective of their nationality, is of immense value.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the way health care works, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
We want you to feel at home here and we want you to be safe."
Christine Abercrombie has undergone an emergency surgery due to a head injury
Tennessee's Mike's department reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent surgery for a head injury when he lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State's head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury game was ahead of half-time.
"He came to the side line and collapsed there," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff put him on a stretcher and provided oxygen at the side line to Abercrombie before taking him for further examination.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris "has no further details on the type/intensity of the injury", saying the state of Tennessee was trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie B, a redshirt second-year student, was in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, which brought his total season score to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers charge a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK and are used to the homeless under the new Tory plans with the money that comes with that much more.
The move will neutralise the success of the carbin drive that has been made to attract young voters
Those who do not pay taxes in the UK are subject to higher stamp duty.
The Treasury expects it will increase up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will charge higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and use the surplus money to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's affordable housing and high-income pledges drive that made it more appealing to younger voters.
In the UK, high stamp duty is imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay tax, with the extra money contributing to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The surcharge - up to three per cent - can be added on second homes in addition to the existing stamp duty, including higher charges introduced two years ago on buy-to-let.
The Treasury expects to charge an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
13 per cent of the newly-constructed London properties will be bought by non-UK residents, raising prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to realize their dream of a home.
Many of the country's most prosperous areas - especially in the capital - have become "graveyards" because the majority of foreign buyers who do not live in the country have bought homes here.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a further increase in stamp duty for young people to own their first home.
It was alleged that large construction companies were over-inflating property prices by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to remove quotas on low-cost housing to address Britain's "homelessness."
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent controls and "no-fault" exits.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that I would dedicate my premiership to reviving the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
We want to develop our home market.
Britain has always welcomed people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it's not as easy to buy homes for foreign-based companies as it is for people who don't live in the UK like hard-working British residents.
"A lot of people are not happy and the reality is far from the truth."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to play for Scotland'
Jack Ross, the owner of Sunderland, has said his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old took on the challenge of reviving the North-East club, currently third in League One.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B cap, that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden with my dad when I was younger. It was always something that caught on and stopped me.
That's the only way I'll be successful."
Prior to Ross, the managers of Sunderlands were Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poete and Paulo de Canio.
The former Alova Athletic boss felt that there was no fault in following teams of such magnitude in the big club after he had previously rejected statements from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"'Can I return this club to the Premier League?' This is the victory for me at the moment
It is undoubtedly a Premier League side because the structure and facilities at this club are like that," he said.
"If I can get the club back there, it's like winning here. But it's not going to be easy to get there."
As an assistant boss at Dumbarton, Ross came into his management career after 15 months on the Harts coaching staff.
He helped Alova recover from expulsion to the third level as well as move St. Mirren from the brink of expulsion to the championship title winners the following season.
Ross said he feels much more comfortable now than he did in his playing career at Clyde, Heart Pool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
He added: "It's probably a two way street.
"I really believe that management is better for me than playing.
I've made a good income and enjoyed some good successes, which feels strange because I've made a little good progress, that's all.
But it can be hard to play.
There is a lot to do each week.
Management seems to be correct despite the stresses of the job.
I have been very comfortable with my presence throughout my entire adult life. I have always wanted to manage and now do."

The ideal time for a pint is at 5.30 pm on Saturday, the survey found
Summer storms have increased the takings of pubs in Britain's losses, but have put more pressure on restaurants.
Sales of pub and bar groups rose 2.7 percent in July - but taking in restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consultancy that compiled the statistics, said: “Excessive sun exposure and England’s longer participation in the World Cup were the same results as in June of the previous month, raising pub revenues by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were more seriously damaged.
Restaurant trading fell 1.8 per cent in June, further down in July.
Drink-led pubs and bars have made a strong showing with the ones they love more than restaurants.
Although not as dramatic as restaurant operators, pubs, where food was a key business, were also affected this summer.
People seem to want to go out for a drink.
Managed pubs and bars beverage sales increased by up to 6.6 percent, while food was down by three percent."
Rest and hospitality analysts RSM Paul Newman said: "These results will continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events can be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It's no surprise that with ongoing cost pressures and a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales, restaurant groups are struggling.
There won't be much more time for food-borne operators during the hot summer months, and time will tell whether or not the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed rate."
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including the new opening, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-outs.
Established as an industry benchmark, the Coffer Peach Tracker industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups within the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, concluding that the total turnover is over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion.

Eilish Doyle, will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eield Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that are kept secret from adults.
Photo-sharing site Instagram is short for - "fake insta" accounts that saw rapid growth in a survey of 20,000 middle school students.
This increased the risk of sexual contact.
Twenty per cent of the students said they operate a clean "main" account to show to their parents, as well as a private one.
A mother discovered a secret site for her 13-year-old daughter in which she was surprised to see a young woman asking others to "rape me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters "and Head Mistress Distrust" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of whom admitted to having private accounts.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are searching in ways that parents and teachers can’t find in creating online spaces.”
Eilish Doyle, will be the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eild Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a Non-Executive Director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most ornate track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty has described it as a great opportunity to benefit those who will be guided by her vast experience at the international level over the past decade.
Beatty said, "Elied has a lot of respect for Scottish, UK and world athletics and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by getting her on the board".
Doyle said: “I’m eager to be a voice for athletes and I’m hoping that I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta between his four Olympic golds, is now a regular BBC Pundit, unable to walk after a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I had a stroke a month ago today.
I cant walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I'm going to make it or not.
It's hard work, but I'm fully recovered, learning how to walk again, and practicing to stay active today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Breast pump ad likens mothers to cows, sparks online backlash
A breast pump company has received backlash online with a statement comparing nursing mothers to milch cows.
To mark the launch of what can be said to be "the world's first silent, wearable breast bump," consumer tech company LV Tung-in-Cheek Music has released a video-inspired statement, showcasing the freedom that new pump mothers are given in eloquence.
Four real mothers tie cows and dance in a haystack: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see your tail" and "If you don't notice, these are not shrubs, they're my breasts."
The chorus continues: "pump it, pump it, I feed the children, pump it, pump it, I milk it, ladies."
However, the announcement, published on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy online.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, with many commenting that it would shed light on the "horrible aspects" of the dairy industry.
"Using cows to advertise this product is not a good idea at all.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, and within a few days of giving birth, their babies are weaned off of them," one wrote.
The inner lining of the breast (LV/mother) is well-fitted.
Another commented: "It's a very painful thing for both mother and child.
Why don't they use the death penalty to protect their children?
Another added: "A statement that does not give primacy to sentiments."
Others defended the statement, acknowledging that a woman had found a "ridiculous" song for her.
"I think that's a wise idea.
I still have a few for my parents.
The message seemed clear to me.
The book was a little boring, but I enjoyed it.
"It's a brilliant idea," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun statement that targets mothers who pump (often in their offices or toilets) and "feel like cows."
This is not to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with the amazing pumps they had in their bra.
This is based on the idea that many women who are breast-feeding are considered to be cows.
The LV pump is completely silent, without wires or tubes inside a nursing bra and not properly fitted, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even be able to move out when pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner of Mothering and ECD, commented: "LV Pump is such a revolutionary product that it has made a bold and provocative campaign.
Having entertained and relatively demonstrated the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings by drawing a parallel between the articulating women and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breast pumping and all of its challenges.
This is not the first time that the LV pump has come to the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of the two was seen doing a catwalk for designer Marta Zukabowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
While monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, the number of detained migrant children has increased, as the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants, so they tried to stay in the country, creating some sort of disturbance by taking children.
The risk was further increased in June when federal officials announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and share data with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, announced before Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor the company, along with minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
"80 percent of individuals who have been sponsors or household members are here illegally in the country, and a majority of them are foreigners with a criminal history.
"We're going to continue to work with them," said Alvarez.
Seeking to more quickly process the process related to children, the authorities have introduced new regulations, which are the last norm for shelter workers, which will take place faster than 60 days later.

According to reports emanating from the system in recent months, if children are in custody for an extended period of time, they are likely to become anxious or depressed, leading to violent outbursts or attempts to escape.
Lawyers said those concerns had been raised in a large facility such as Torniello, where they felt it was difficult to identify a child who was being bullied because of its huge size.
They said it's compound trauma that many people are already struggling with moving children to the tent city, not giving them enough time to mentally prepare, or saying goodbye to friends.
The Syrian government has demanded the immediate withdrawal of French and Turkish "occupying forces" from the country.
Even though it has now been eight years since the start of the country's war, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem has also called on Syrian refugees to return home at the UN General Assembly.
Maupalem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally operating on Syria's soil, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and "we will take action against them."
"They should be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said.
Moulem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said he would continue this holy struggle until Damascus, "terrorist groups", "illegal foreign presence" and purge all Syrian territory."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Moulem said the conditions were good for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears," which had prompted refugees to stay away.
"We seek the assistance of the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They're dealing with the human condition."
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid to Syria will not be forthcoming until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel-held area has provided an opportunity for political negotiations, according to UN diplomats.
The Russian-Turkish agreement halted a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, home to some three million people.
However, he stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and hoped that there would be military action aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, as well as that it would be "eliminated."
UN Ambassador Staffan de Misra expressed the hope that the first meetings of a new committee comprising government and opposition members would be convened soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The committee was conditioned on the Syrian government's participation, warning that the panel's work would be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and not to interfere.
Trump wins second term

Money from the outside will flood the house races in the midterm elections.
It wouldn't come as a surprise to see Pennsylvania's 17th cash flood, thanks to a redesign of the congressional districts that dropped two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
These recently reconstituted suburban Pittsburgh district ditches Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th District of Old Pennsylvania, a huge margin with the new 17th.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that old districts should be constitutionally administered in favor of Republicans.
The campaign finance fest kicked off between the main party Finance Armaments, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) in the new 17th race.
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after being widely seen in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade, with President Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
A small amount of money was given to political prisoners.
El Salvador was fined for supporting U.S. China, but later withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little help from Washington.
Trump had a heart-to-heart meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and the partners stayed at a hotel in Panama until Trump fired the company's management team.
Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials had decided to call on American chiefs of diplomatic operations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore."
But the only penalties considered were on El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug controls, development, and financial assistance.
The proposed penalties, cuts to financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, were painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, seen as a step in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the meeting to move forward, effectively ending the imposition of fines on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the meeting in mid-October, in a sign that the administration is importing sites for the meeting, diplomats said.
Also, three American ambassadors quietly returned from Washington to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments.
A spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the claims made by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal ideas of the anonymity clause.
Their accounts were verified by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and spoke on the anonymity clause as well.
Studying history
Now that there is so much substantial evidence on the public record, Special Counsel Robert Mueller on top of Trump's potential legal barrier could stop him from taking action later.
Mueller's investigation also revealed that Trump's campaign was involved in a Russian attack on our election.
If Congress changed hands, Trump would have him back in the body as he and the voters had moved on, and possibly his fellow justices in the end.
But for the most part, it's when and if Trump loses that's inevitable - or at least I'm not referring to people like him in Europe.
Both sides of the Atlantic have all of us to make choices that will affect how long the fight stretches.
In 1938, if the West resisted him and fortified Czechoslovakia in Munich, the German authorities were prepared to use military force against Hitler to defeat him.
We've lost a generation and we've lost a generation.
The path in history revolves around such drastic changes and the unimaginative walk of democracy can be accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is facing many of these changes.
What are we going to do if Trump gets angry at Deputy General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the task of Mueller's investigation?
Last year, the magazine reported that Rosenstein had been secretly recording the president and speculating that he was unfit for power.
Mr. Rogenstein says that The Times is not certain of the argument.
"How would he react if the newly sought FBI search on Brett Kavanaugh was not completely or prejudicial - or if he was confirmed to the Supreme Court whether he had sexual assault and fraud?
And, most of all, are we going to put Congress in the middle of the do-it-yourself Congress that's responsible for Trump?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will be in danger.
But I believe that because of the lesson I learned in Prague, we will not fail.
My mother was Jewish from Czechoslovakia, and during the same Nazi regime, she was exiled from my diplomatic home to the country of the Austwiz.
She survived, emigrated to America, and sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table of the swastika 60 years later.

Graham Dorrans of Rangers, who were looking forward to the match against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with a win over the Austrians after a stunning draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month putting them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
Midfielder Graham Dorans knee injury prevented him from playing for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he expressed confidence that the Rangers would use that result as a springboard to reach greater heights.
"It's a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," Graham, 31, said.
"We went into the game to do something, and we scored a point.
We may have run out of chances in the end but, on the whole, the draw is probably a good result.
Maybe they played well in the first half but we played a good team in the second half.
Thursday's match is another big European night.
We were hoping to get three points, but it was a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the people on our side, I am sure that we can move forward and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, although there have been changes in my injuries and clubbing that have caused me to feel better about the position.
The team is good and the players are enjoying it well; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward and win the last season."
Women don't want to sleep with men
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people were talking about this with their family.
About half of the people in the study, which was done nationwide, were talking to their spouse about long-term care.
Only 10 percent of the children talked about it.
"People want to have a family member take care of them, but they're not taking steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the national-level life insurance business.
Heres where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to provide for your family if your wishes are not conveyed in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those options can be a unique factor in determining cost.
Take your financial advisor's advice: Your advisor may be able to help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy to help cover these costs, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, or self-insurance with your own health - as long as you have the money.
Come to a decision with your legal documents: Avoid legal fights in advance.
Take out a health-care policy so that you can hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care, and make sure that the professionals will carry out your wishes in the event that you can't communicate.
Also, consider a power of attorney for your financial needs.
You can choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are not competent.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that one of your parents had a medical emergency at an older age and was on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write them down in a plan to be prepared.
“Financial matters are not only essential, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.

A man in Il Frakampbe fired several times with an air rifle
A man walking home from work at night was shot multiple times with an air rifle.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in Devon Oxford Grove, in the Il Fracombe area, and was shot in his chest, abdomen and arm.
Describing the manner in which the shoot was done, the officials said that it took place around 02:30 BST, as an "incidental act."
Those who attacked him were not seen by the victim.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police sought their help for evidence.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of milk on Friday, an official said, and the death toll could rise.
Due to the suspension of communication, rescue officials were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala Regency, which had a magnitude of 7.5, near the epicenter of the earthquake in the northern region of Pala.
After the disaster in milk, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about milk and tortoises on the island of Sulawesi:
The central Sulawesi region is located in the west coast of the island of Sulawesi in the Gulf of Aden, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
The Donggala Regency is a 300 km (180 mi) stretch of coastline northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, Province Kna Low administrative area had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of the Central Sulawesi region, especially the coastal region of Donggala, is mainly fishing and agriculture.
Nickel and mining are also important in the area, but for the most part, it is located mostly in Moravoli, opposite the Sulawesi coast.
According to Indonesia's disaster management agency, the tsunami hit Paula and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongguan.
In 1996, nine people were killed by a tsunami in the western part of the country.
Indonesia is seismically located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years include:
2004: On December 26, a tsunami struck 14 countries off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Aceh, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, most of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.

More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai islands along Sumatra, damaging up to 10 meters of tsunami, destroying dozens of villages and killing 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Paidy Jaya Regency in Aceh, devastating the 2004 earthquake and tsunami, and people remain in fear.
No tsunami was reported at this time, but more than 100 people died in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people. Most occurred north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and made thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin's eldest son, Track Palin, has been charged with assault.
Palin, 29, of Alaska and Wasilla, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and for interfering with a domestic violence report, according to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman tried to make a call to report the alleged crimes, he snatched the phone from her.
KTU reports that Palin was placed on remand at the Matt-Su Pretrial Facility and placed with a $500 unsecured bond guarantee.
He appeared in court on Saturday where, when asked by his pleader, he was declared "absolutely not guilty," the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B misdemeanor, sentenced to one day in jail and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Paul.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is now before the Alaska Court of Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with interfering with domestic violence reporting and possession of a weapon in an intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her with a fist on her face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by the Veterans Group for her son's violent behavior in 2016 that stemmed from his service in Iraq.
The earthquake in Indonesia killed hundreds of people.
At least 384 people were killed on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5 magnitude earthquake resulted in a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near Sulawesi, the capital of Indonesia and northeast of Jakarta.
Videos of the earthquake have gone viral on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people came to the beach festival in the city of Pal.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect
New York prosecutors are seeking the rarest non-executable death sentence in a state for federal crime since 1953, for Sayfullo Soipov, who is suspected of causing the death of eight people in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Soipov, 30, illegally used a home depot rental truck in Lower Manhattan to carry out an attack on the way to the West Side Highway, on a bike that was going down the sidewalk and a cyclist on his way.
According to the notice for the purpose of seeking the death penalty, in order to be able to do justice to the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, Saipov must prove that he killed eight victims "intentionally" and "intentionally" caused serious bodily injuries.
According to court documents, both counts could potentially result in a death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted a 22-count man with eight counts of murder in support of racketeering, which is commonly used by federal prosecutors in an organized crime and in felony counts of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack was "insufficient planning and preconceived thinking," describing Saipove's conduct as "extremely cruel, brutal and morally depraved."
"Bahibullevik saipove in Saiful caused damage to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Un-Laure Decadit, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hermann Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damin Pungnuko," states the notice.
Five of the victims were tourists.
The Southern District of New York has been sentenced to death for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last federal execution in New York was in 1953 in the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case, where a married couple were convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, two Rosenbergs were executed in electric chair.
Saibov, a resident of Uzbekistan, acted without remorse for days and months after the attack, according to a court document.
He told the police that he was doing what he thought was right.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was motivated for the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone.
He said he did not want ISIS flag to be displayed in the hospital room.
He did not agree with the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders who represented Saipove, said he was "absolutely disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think the lack of a release from life imprisonment with a confession of guilt adds to the pain of these events on behalf of everyone involved," Patton said.
The SAIPOD defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations
"Nijel Farage took a pledge today to ""establish a people's army"" during a protest at the Tory conclave."
Political leaders felt the heat from Euroseptics, one of Theresa Mays own MPs suggested that he should be in charge of EU negotiations, former EU leaders said.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said that the UK would still be out if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary with a march in Birmingham.
The challenge is deeply divided in addressing the challenge posed by Mrs. May, who rose to the ranks designated by the Pro-Remain Tories by participating in a special protest against Brexit in the city.
She's struggling to keep the checkers on track between Brexiters, reminders, and attacks from the EU in the compromise plan.
The allies insisted on going ahead with the deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and Euroseptics and Labour forced her to choose between the package and the 'Kaos'.
"""Chuck Checkers wanted me at the Bonn Leave Means Leave rally in Solihil,"" he said."
It was suggested that Frazee should be examined with Brussels and held accountable for the negotiations.
If I was accused, I would have been out by now, he said.
Welling Borough MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we have to throw chuckers.'
In his opposition to the EU, he said: We are not fighting to keep the world at war.
We wanted to make our own laws in our own country.'
The public opinion suggestions from the 2016 vote were canceled by Mr. Bone: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>Their idea that the British people have changed their minds and that it is absolutely untrue that they should stay.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also present at the march and told reporters: I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"""Chequers are not popular with the general public, the opposition is going to vote for it, it's with our party and activists on the streets without actually being popular with them and electing us in the first place."
Please drop checkers and start listening.'
In a message to May, she said: <0xE2><0x80><0x98>The Prime Minister keeps his post when he fulfills his promises.’
"If they betray the decisions made by the rally's political leaders in the 2016 referendum, they must feel the heat,"" he said."
Its like a trust thing between our people and our political class, he said.
<0xE2><0x80><0x98>They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here to tell them, <0xE2><0x80><0x98>We’re not going to let you do that.’
"In an enthusiastic crowd, he said: ""I think our political class should feel the heat that wants to harm Brexit."
<0xE2><0x80><0x98>Give us a victory in Brexit, we encourage the people’s army of this country, and we will not rest until we are independent and have a self-governing, proud United Kingdom.’
In the meantime, the reminders marched through Birmingham before driving a two-hour rally through the city center.
After the group was unveiled this weekend, a small number of activists rushed to the Tories against the Brexit banners.
Labour peer Lord Adonis was baffled by the safety issues they experienced with a one-party app right from the start of the conclave.
"""These people, Matto, and all of the technology for Canada plus plus that they can get the IT systems they want, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,"" he said."
This is totally a farce.
"There's nothing like a good book," he said.
"Varen, who is running for president, ""looks tough"""
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election that she was "strongly looking at running for president."
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday about her future.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump and running for re-election against GOP State Rep. Jeff Dehill, was co-chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is looking forward to competing in 2020.
It was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall since Trump came to power on Saturday afternoon.
One of them asked if she wanted to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our government that's messed up and put a woman in the top position."
Man Arrested After Being Shot By LSU's Sims
A suspect was arrested on Saturday in connection with the shooting death of police LSU basketball player Wade Simms in Baton Rouge, LA.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced Dayton Simpson's arrest at 11 a.m. ET News Conference.
They asked for help in identifying the man in the footage and released a video on Friday.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University on Friday.
"Wade Sims sustained a gunshot wound and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, 247 Sports reported.
Wade resisted to save his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and while in the scene, he confessed to having a weapon and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Growing up in Baton Rouge, 6-inch-6 junior, The Sims 32 played 10 starts in the last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: After his victory over Sebastian Vettel, Lewis Hamilton is close to a world title
Ever since Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, it has been clear that Mercedes will play a bigger role in the team's orders race than Lewis Hamilton.
From the poll, Bothas had a good start and almost bludgeoned Hamilton to a point, defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting Wettel to attack his teammate.
Wettel first went to Pitts and ran into traffic on the pack tail, something that might have been a certainty.
Mercedes later pitched in a lap and arrived behind Wettel, but Hamilton saw a Ferrari driver who was reluctant to be inside a hazard after a double move to protect the third corner after two wheel-to-wheel action.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh in the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then stayed on top of his tires for a quick finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth and went on to make the big part of the race.
As a result, he came to Pitts in the 44th lap but Riconnen finished fourth as he was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps.
"It's a difficult day because Vulture did a fantastic job over the weekend I and a real person by my side.
"The team did a great job," Hamilton said.
It's actually a bad sign
Washington: US President Donald Trump on Saturday slammed senior Senator Diana Feinstein for insisting that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford alleging that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a rally.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was not directly addressed to the president, but instead commented that what was happening in the Senate was that people were "less, worse and more untruthful."
"The only thing that can happen and the coolest thing is to go to the Senate the last few days, when you see the anger, when you see people being angry, and less and less and worse and lying," he said.
"When you look at the releases and leaks, they say, 'Oh, that's not what I do.'
I did not do it."
Remember that?
Dennis Feinstein, are you ready?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lock up."
Okay, wait a minute.
Whether we leaked it...no, we didn't leak it," he said, according to the Senator's seal.
A letter was sent by Ford in July explaining the allegations against Kavanaugh and it was leaked in September - but Finnstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak her story," Finnstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her refusal to attend a meeting with the president was commented on during Saturday night's rally: "I'll tell you what it is, really it's bad body language.
She may not be, but I've never seen it as bad as that."
Continuing his defense in the Supreme Court, the president pointed out that Democrats have been using the charges for their own machinations, those who have been accused of sexual misconduct by three women.
"They are determined to come back to power in some way.
"When you're young, you look at being bad, they don't care who it hurts, they don't care who it overthrows to get power and control," the president said.

Hundreds of people died in the air traffic control plane crash.
The air traffic controller was praised after the air traffic controller in Indonesia made sure that the plane carrying hundreds of people was safely inserted.
More than 800 people died and the island was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami on Friday.
Strong subsequent eruptions continued in the area and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Paul.
But while his colleagues were fighting for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunavan Agang refused to quit his job and madly left the control tower at the Mutiara Cis Al Zufri Airport Pali Airport.
Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He thought the traffic control tower had collapsed and jumped from there.
He later died in hospital.
The decision could have saved hundreds of lives, said Hohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia.
We prepared a helicopter to take him from Balak Papan in Kalimantan to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him before he could reach the helicopter milk.
"When we heard that, we were stunned," he said.
In the meantime, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, saying the country's disaster prevention agency has restricted access to towns of thieves, Sigi and Boutung.
"Since many bodies are still under the rubble, we believe we need to reach many more that can be grown," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
A six-foot-tall tree will be planted in the community on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The markets are all over the place."
John Gelfand, International Red Cross Head in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is moving forward to provide assistance to those who have survived but we don't know what they have to find here.
It's already bad, but it could be worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in the city of Palo Alto on Sunday, telling the country's military: "I urge you all to work day and night in connection with the excavating work.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
More than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year.
Air New Zealand plane crash: A man has gone missing after his plane crashed in Lagos
The airline's plane crashed in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, and 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niuei said that as of Saturday afternoon, the male passenger had not been able to locate one.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
Further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality, were not immediately provided by the airline.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew while landing at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were hospitalized and that the condition of all of them was stable.
The cause of collapse and the exact sequence of events that took place are not clear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the boats had landed in the lagoon near the runway.
There was some evidence that the water was leaking.
American Airlines flight attendant Bill Janes said the plane landed at a very low altitude.
"That's a good thing," Jones said.
Jenus said he and others tried to walk away from the sinking plane by way of an emergency.
He said that the flight attendants shouted in alarm and he received minor injury.
The US Navy said that the sailors working nearby, who were constructing the dock before the aircraft sank in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water, also helped the crew to get back to shore using an airstrip.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network's PNG-registered airlines suggest that 111 people have died in the last two decades but no one has been killed by Air New Zealand.
O'Neill has been reported missing
On Saturday, the prosecution again rested its case on a man accused of abducting a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for a few hours as an expert witness in the Intelligence Department.
The 29-year-old Quinton Tellies and the victim, Jessica Chambers, told the court how he used cell phone records to shred them into pieces on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlatt said she was with the Tellis Chambers on the evening of her death and that he had received location data from a lot of cell phone contrary to his previous claim, the Clarion Ledger reported.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanfred when his cell phone was found in the chambers, and police were dispatched to speak to Sanfred.
Sanford testified that he was not in town that Saturday.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth, he said that Sanford was in the truck that night, saying that Sanfred "was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
The other is that she had known for about two weeks when Chambers died.
According to their cell phone records, they had only known each other for a week.
According to Rowlatt, for a period of time after Chambers' death, the Chambers deleted text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"It took her out of my life," he said.
On Sunday, they were scheduled to begin their closing arguments.
The judge said the case would go to a trial later in the day.

The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through people like Akala and Louie.
Another black person?!
N.Y. Nani's wife filed a case against him over his 'racist' remark
The couple were sued in New York for indiscriminately setting fire to Nanny after she received the wrong text complaining that she was "another black person" from her mother.
The pair denied the allegations, calling the case a "trait" as racist.
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two and new childcare provider, Giselle Maris, was outraged when she found out she was black when she came to work on her first day in 2016.
"Don't want another black man," Mrs. Flaxo-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, the Plaxo-Flaxman, after she realized her mistake, "comfortable" and firebombed Miss Maris, saying that the leaving nanny had done something African-American bad and was expecting a Filipino instead.
Miss Maurice was paid for her day job and sent home for Uber.
Maurice is now seeking compensation for the farting and sued the couple for up to $350 per day for six months to live on as they were initially hired, even without a contract.
"I wanted to show them, look, you don't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know that's discretionary."
The couple said that they were racists and that it was also helpful for Maurice to take a job and that they feared that they would not be able to trust her after hurting her.
"My wife sent me one that she couldn't tell me.
She is not a racist.
"We're not racists," her husband, Joel, said.
Do you have a child in your life who is deaf and hard of hearing?
Your new-born baby?
tell you."
The case was "robbery," as if it had been only two months since his wife had given birth to the child, and was "in a very difficult situation," said Plasco.
"Are you going with any of them?"
"It's not good for investors," he said.
While legal cases are still pending, the court of public opinion has been quick to attack the couple on their conduct and logic on social media.
Paddington Publishers Fear Readers Won't Be Able to Establish a Relationship to Talk About What the New Letter Reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Zankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It would be hard to get anyone to read it before it was published.
We're very happy with the success of the program."
She said her father, who was a BBC cameraman inspired to write a children's book by Little Toy Bear, was pleased that his work had been rejected, and that the book's publication's 60th anniversary following his death last year was "bitter."
Paddington has been described as "the most important person in our family," with her father being the most proud of her upcoming success.
"He's not a very good person," she said.
“But since Paddington is real to him, if you have a child who achieves something, it’s almost the same: you can be proud of them even if you don’t.
I think that's the way he sees success.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always valued Pondington."
My daughter is dying and I have to say goodbye on the phone
Upon arrival, she took her daughter to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her.
"Nad has been calling regularly that it was so bad that she expected it to be done," Ms. Ednan-Leparous said.
"Then I got a call from Nad. The next two minutes she said she was going to die and I told her I wanted to take a vacation.
I said it.
I said, "I love you, Daddy.
I will come to you soon.
I will come to you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to have a heart pump slowed down and she left the system.
She died before that and it was all over.
I know it's going to happen, and I'm going to wait.
I couldn't scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation where families and individuals surrounded me.
I really need to get it all together."
As a result of the loss of her daughter, Mrs. Ednan-Leparous, who boarded the plane with the other passengers, has forgotten her plight.
"Nobody knows," she said.
"I tilted my head and all that time there was water in my eyes.
It was hard to explain, but I felt this overwhelming sympathy for Nader on the flight.
He wants my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Women's Self-Defense Program to Prevent Suicides at the Crossroads
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from losing their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards with phone numbers for people to call for inspired messages and support on the Welsh Bridge.
Miss Davis' son Tyler committed suicide at the age of 13 and 18 when he was diagnosed with depression.
"I don't want to be like my parents every day," she said.
Ms Davis, 45, lives in Lidney, a well-known hospital where her son has an infectious smile.
"Everyone knows about his smile.
"They'll never see the light of day."
Before he died, however, he stopped working because he was "in a really dark place."
Taylor's brother, who was 11 at the time, committed suicide in 2014.
Miss Davies said: "I'm constantly concerned that I might be able to hang on to the blame again."
Miss Davis made the cards, "Go out and talk, even if a friend doesn't want you to flirt with people that there are people there for you."
Sit down and talk."
Miss Humphreys, for years a friend of Miss Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark and his mother shortly after her death.
"He didn't say he was depressed or in depression or that he felt anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, he - when the children opened their presents, he was so engrossed that he could not look at them or see anything."
She said that his death had caused them a major injury, but they had to work on it: "It would make a hole in the family.
It divides us.
We all have to keep fighting."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"If we can incubate anything like what he's asking - in the time-tested, limited ambition - we can bring in some unity," Mr. Flack said on Saturday, adding that he was also worried that the committee was "falling apart" as it was stuck in the middle of a partisan girdle lock.
Why didn't Mr. Kuwanou and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their desire is all the time.
The midterm elections are just four weeks away, on November 6 - and if Republicans do as badly as expected, their efforts to get the person they want elected to the nation's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush took the phone to call all the senators, including the man who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and his wife, Ashley, to support Mr. Kavanaugh as Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
The Senate currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could secure at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which could enable Mike Pence, the vice president, to rescind the deal and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim
The North Korean defectors fell to South Korea after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years earlier, South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Baeyang-seug, the unifying minister for the South, said there were 1,127 defections last year compared with 2,706 in 2011.
There are strict border controls between North Korea and China and high rate of charging by individuals smugglers are key factors.
The Penguins didn't do anything.
Most of the defectors were granted North Korean citizenship.
Seoul estimates that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, having a very long border with North Korea, and crossing between the two Koreas is easier than crossing the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ).
China considers the migrants as Akram migrants and forcibly sends them back to their home country.
Relations between the North and the South - which were technically still at war - have improved greatly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyeongyang to focus on anti-nuclear weapons talks.
It was a historic June meeting following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad conditions for working towards a nuclear-weapon-free Korean territory.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US grants for a lack of progress since then.
"Without any trust in the U.S., there can be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, it is unlikely that we will be unilaterally unarmed first," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
"Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh ""Historical"" and said he was unfit to serve the Supreme Court"
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi met Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and said he was "unfit" to serve the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"If a woman ever chooses that path, and I couldn't help but notice, they're called "Historical," Pelosi said before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, responding to Kavanaugh's testimony.
When they were teenagers with Kavanaughs temper, they refused to accuse Dr. Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment.
In his opening statement, Cavanaugh was so emotional, almost choked up and choked while discussing his family and his high school years.
He specifically denied the Democrats on the committee, his above-ground accusations made by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton had been defeated in the 2016 presidential election, were "strange and co-ordinated behavior that is vicious."
Pelosi said she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he should disqualify himself for those ads and the way he went behind the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
When she was asked if she would try to charge Kavanaugh if he confirmed and if the Democrats would gain a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi objected.
"I would say -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not just fit for the Supreme Court, he's not fit for the court we currently have," Pelosi said.
Kawanou is presently a Judge in D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that she, as a Democrat, considered the potential Kanawha rulings as a conservative judge in exchange for the Afaroodable Care Act, or Rovi.
In his affirmation judgments, Sawaneau was asked whether he could alter the judgments of the particular Supreme Court..
"It's time for the hysterical, partisan person to go to court and say we're not all that awesome," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
It was blasphemy in the word of righteousness, and the rage of months and years, and she was not able to take it out.
"We get angry when we get angry," Ms. Steinme told me 45 years later.
"I thought it was not so unusual, do you think?"
She continued, "Somewhere getting help through a woman who was working as an executor, she would cry when she got angry, but when the anger came and she started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You can say I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I am furious."
And she said that.
I thought it was wonderful."
Watering of the eyes is allowed during periods of terror.
From my fast-paced memories of the previous job, in the office where the male-dominated office was, when I cried to myself with unspeakable anger, I could tell that the older woman - the manager who was always kind of cool with her - grabbed my scarf and dragged me into the stairwell.
She said, "I'll never see you again."
They don't know you're angry.
They will be happy when they see you."
Patricia Schroeder, the then-Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on the rules of his presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business and in a non-verbal relationship and pulled out of the race, Miss Schroeder, very upset, learned that she had no reason to go for the president.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said, smiling at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven others in the race, and they wanted the last one."
Someone said it was "Sazno White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because of the delay in the campaign, she was hesitant to raise funds and promised not to enter the race unless she collected $2 million.
It's a losing war.
Her supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, found that she was given only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
Announced that she would not be starting an official campaign, she was overcome by so much emotion - gratitude towards the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target votes rather than delegates and anger at sexism.
"You might think I was depressed," Ms. Schkoder recalled of how the press reacted to her.
"I thought you were my business partner.
Do you remember what I wrote in my book?
"Is she crying?"""
U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
Experts have said that the trade war between the US and China is far from over and that the differences between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, sent the first warning to Chinese experts earlier this year by imposing taxes, including on solar panels, steel and aluminum.
A lot of the special gains this week included $200 billion worth of goods, with half of the tax impacting all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has recently raised tariffs by five to ten percent on nearly $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed a blow to the U.S. and the world's second-largest economy may not falter any time soon.
Bringing back Washington means bowing down to demands, but the campaign to bow down to the U.S. Xi Jinping can be very embarrassing for the Chinese president.
Experts say that if Beijing plays its cards properly, the pressure of a US trade war could favor China by reducing the two economies' interdependence over a period of time.
"A quick fix in Washington or Beijing poisons the economy more dangerous than any country has admitted before," said Abigail Grace, an associate at the Center for New American Security, Asia at the Center for Research in the Tank.
"Syria is ""ready"" for the return of refugees"
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country that has been ravaged for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualim said the situation in the country was developing.
"Today the field is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government is trying to restore normalcy in the area.
There are all the conditions for the return of the country's refugees due to the unilateral negotiations that they have to leave due to terrorism and targeted their lives and living conditions.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people are still in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Masri said the Syrian government could help rebuild the devastated country.
He said he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had sponsored the rebellion.
The winner of the European Championship in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National Outdoor Paris, France.
Now the U.S. has lost on European territory six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
The Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the tournament, took a tee shot into the water in the 16th hole of Par-3, giving the game to Francesco Molinaari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players in the current format starting in 1979 and 5-0-0.
The American Jordan Spieth was the lowest-ranked player in the European team when he lost to Thor Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Olsen of Denmark 5 & 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to England's Anya Poulter, who may have played his final rider's cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's all-time winning European with 25.5 career points.
I can't stand the 7's today.
It has been almost a year.
Thank you for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to win the award again.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I can help," said Garcia, who was emotional after the European win.
He also provided a shield to his fellow domestic player John Ram, who defeated U.S. goalkeeper Tiger Woods in singles 2 and 1 on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Wood and have watched him grow," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Wood lost his four games in France and now his Ryder Cup record is 13-21-3.
Jack Nicklaus is the second-highest-paid player in the history of the sport, having won 14 major titles.
Team USA over the weekend struggled to find good ways out, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fina, all of whom played power golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after his team was disappointed, "I'm proud of them, for what they fought for."
Today we took a trip to Europe.
We've been going strong.
Get out of here, Thomas.
Hes a great captain.
12 players played very well.
"We'll be a regrouping, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on."
I'm proud to be one of those people and I'm proud to be one of them.
You've got to put your cap on.
We've been good."
