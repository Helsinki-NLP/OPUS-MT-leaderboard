The sea is ours: Bolivia, like the whole country, thinks that the way back to her court would be opened by the court to allow her to go into the Pacific.
sailors came to the main office of the Regimes, in La Paz.
At the government’s buildings, a blue flag was hung in the air.
The moon set out in the narcotics Centers from Lake Titicaca to Amazon: "It's our right to go to the sea."
It is our responsibility to take it back."
In the fourth century B.C.E., Bolivia had the world’s first encounter with a variety of crops, some of which had once claimed to be extinct in the Pacific Ocean.
They have been on this team for decades, but after five long discussions, the international court is about to execute his judgment on October 1.
"Bollya is on a good Jonathane, here's religion, there's peace, so we think it's a good result." Bolivian Rörto like that.
Throughout the country, many Bolivian people will see the ICJ judgment on a large screen, haggined by the war in Bolivia over the decades, and now they will communicate with Chile and make room for some room at sea.
President of the local people, Evo Moorillas, was on his way back to elections every year, and he too was excited about the decision on Monday.
"We're going back to the Pacific Ocean, in August."
However, many researchers feel that the court’s judgment could not have been valid to Bolivia, and this is a minor change.
The UN in the Netherlands does not have the authority to set up an area for Chile, and it cannot tell what to do with it, even if there are discussions.

Mosheims, a professor of education who still serves in Latin America, was quoted as saying that he was using this subject to his political advantage.
He said that Bolivia will never abandon his right to reach the great ocean of the Pacific."

John Edward: Globalizations need language skills
According to a report in the United Nations Children’s Fund, more and more young adults are being taught how to deal with their sexual urges, whether sexual or personal.
These schools of 30,000 people all over Scotland have been organized by the Scotsman School of Public School (SCIS) and have served the best services for their students and their parents.
Independent schools want their students to have more higher education, to have better lives, and to make the needed changes in their lives.
In an educational system designed to meet the demands of students, modern languages are considered to be a common and desirable subject in school.
Nelson Ramirka said: "If you speak to a person in language that he understands it, it goes into his brain.
The same is true if you speak in his mother’s native tongue, it goes into his heart."
This is evidence that we cannot establish relationships with other countries based solely on the English language and obtain their trust.
According to a report in the United Nations Children’s Fund, more and more parents are being taught how to raise their children “in the discipline and mental - regulating of Jehovah. ”
And 68 percent of those who read foreign languages achieve a high grade A.
According to a data collected from the SCASIS schools, 72 percent of the respondents received Magna Carta, 72 percent of those who read the German, 69 percent of those who read the French, and 63 percent of those who read the Spanish.
This means that classes in Scotland are receiving knowledge of foreign languages that are definitely useful for young and old in the future.
Languages are now changed to standard text (Sents, technology, engineering, and math).
According to a 2014 survey conducted by the U.S.
So language skills that are especially useful for the future of young people are becoming the priority of day - to - day living.
Language skills are vital in a world that has been affected by the prevalence of language skills.
If you understand the second language in any part of the field, the last thing you can do will be a lot easier for you.
Those who have knowledge of a foreign language who can speak directly to them in their language are certainly in a contest.
According to Yagovov, conducted by an elder of 4,000 in the United States in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at the same time, and only 15 percent could speak French.
So it is important for children to have a variety of languages.
Learning a many languages, especially those from developing lands, can be a valuable tool for children.
In Scotland, there are various languages in every school in the world.
In many schools, there is a high degree of teaching — at the same time, in the eyes of others — Japanese or Manchu.
Regardless of your age, experts in the area are available to help your children learn those languages.
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNESCO) estimates that 1 in 4 young people in the United States suffers from some form of mental disorders during the past decade.
It can be rejected for the present, but there is a key to the country’s future with language and education in the world’s commerce, and it must be added in education.
Must be regarded as "the international UNCLOGS".
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “in the United States alone, 1 out of every 4 Americans suffers from some form of depression, 2 out of every 10 persons in the world, and 8 out of 10 have been infected with the AIDS virus. ”

A train is running for Hardwar students about relax
This year a new training at Harvard University is teaching students who've been drinking over the whole night, teaching them how to get enough rest at night.
The organization saw that even the students did not know basic things, such as how to maintain their health.
The only experts who sleep in the Harvard Medical School met to adopt this kind of training as the first time in U.S. hospitals and women's hospital experts.

Michael Johnson, playing on the front and on the front porch, was distracted by a 12 - time recording of a national record record.
He couldn't be the chief captain in the United States team as before, five times as many keys as his day, he gave himself five key conquests, he broke between himself as a client and the game in his rating to correct his temper.
Michaelson is not a 48 - year - old driver straight at the lowest level of his guard, not a 48 - year - old man, not one of the driver’s company. It's a shame for shots going into the jungle like that.
And if you don't do it enough, Michael Mayson, that's the ninth Sunday, that's the day he's going to meet the British Channel with Francisco Mohamed, he's stuck with him to get his four daughters, he's done this week.
If the U.S.A. were made up of four smaller ones, 12 of them had a wonderful beginning, then Michael McManus is certainly the key.
Fury told his player that he could not say more.
"He fully understood his role today, got my heart pierced, he said, and said he'd be ready tomorrow."
"He has great spirit faith.
He brought a great name to this unit this week, Hall of Fermer and he's been past and he's brought the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two dolls.
I was privileged to serve as a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

So history shows that it's not finished to me and everyone on the team.
Tomorrow you will use your full capacity.
If possible, as far as it depends upon you, be peaceable with all men. ”
This is not to end until you have a point on the board.
We have a goal — to try to win this traffic, so we must focus on it.
I've been on the other side of the world, and I'll look at the 12 players on our side, but I know we're on the other side of the world that they're the greatest players in the world."
Jordan, delighted at the show of his athletes at the Hard Goffoff School, said: “I can't pass this thing on to you.
Another kind of test tomorrow.
There is no doubt that Jehovah’s spirit is at work in the lives of his people. It is a powerful force that can help us to endure any trial.
It’s nice to be with your mate when everything is good, but when you are alone, your ability will be thoroughly tested as you become Goffind as Goffinth.
The message you're supposed to tell all the players, give them their best show tomorrow.
Now, you let your partner leave and he should go and play better for himself."
Unlike Jordan, the opponent Jim Fury wants to give him something more personal than what his players played in a partnership, and the Jordan Smith and Jason Thomas Thomas Thomas, who has three points to this.
Flavi himself was in two teams that did wonders the last day, part of the winning team in the Brooklyn line, due to refusing "Mr. Electra". He's at a player's table in Europe.
Captain Bentley replied, "I remember every disgusting thing about it."
"We have 12 major Manets tomorrow, but you're willing to start faster, as you see in the Brooklyn line and Map.
The result is a high rate of pressure in the brain, which, in turn, can cause much tension in the brain.

The attempt to lead the file background has been given to Thomas, who is hit with the Rotary Male, Paul Cassie, Jayborg, Tom Ridgem, Tom Flick, and Ian Piccone's first European agent.
"If I put these guys in this order, I think it's all good in all things, and Jordan said about the choices of his crews."

On - line discussions were received with an announcement that a Bristol nurse compared mothers to bottle - fed babies.
As for the effort to say, "The first silent, ready Braille bubby", the user's user released the El T-In-Cong video advertising, which presented freedom from being sent to the new mothers in a sense.
Four real mothers build the leaves and dance them in a warm and sunny sun: "Yes, I'm having my share, but you can't find the tail." And if you see, they're not in my chest, but they're in my arms.
The options continue: "Send it, send it, send it, I'm sending the kids, I will send it, I will send it, I'll send it, and I'm having my share."
However, this announcement, published in the Society’s Home Page of Fibonacci, came to an issue.
With 77,000 opinions and hundreds of comments, the video received combinations from the audience, many people thought it would bring light into "floating subjects" of the entertainment.
"It's no good idea to use cows to preach this product.
One has written that like us, they must conceive and give birth to a baby, and within days their offspring will turn away from them."
Nurses (e. g. / Dodge) will be properly sent to Elvis Bristol.
Another commented: “It is a very painful thing for both mother and child.
But why not use Braille to preach for mothers who protect their children?
And others add: “Announcing that no one takes priority of feelings."
Others claim that she's got a "HOD" song.
"This is a clever thought.
In time, I became a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
It seemed as if the sending process was right for me.
The announcement was a little crazy, but I took it personally.
It's a clever invention, "one written."
Another commented: "It's a fun announcement, which is done for a while (in their offices or in their hideouts) and the mothers who feel like the cows.
It's not to commend the industry or judge."
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal what it is like to dance with wonderful senders in their living.
This propaganda is based on insight that said that many women who are sent by Braille would feel like leaves.
Elve will be completely quiet when a nursing broke up, without wires or tubes and properly unfurls, grant women freedom to move, hold their children, and even go out when they send them.
The motherfucker's partner and ECD child, E.D., observed: “Levy sent such a dramatic product, it declared it to be the Board and Reconciliation campaign.
Believers, by comparing the contrast between the contrast between the women and the birds, we show that they're not convinced and that they're going to be sent with a new idea of free will and selfish freedom. We're going to have to keep Bristol and all its challenges in sight.
It's not the first time I came in headlines.
In London’s fashion, for example, there was a lot of controversy over the use of credit cards.

We gently expose those who are not deserving of relief.
According to a report released from this system of things in recent months, children who have had more than their share of secular education are likely to experience anxiety or depression, which leads to acts of violence or warfare.
The judges said that the crisis had taken place, as in the case of Torrrück, where the struggle was over, and the identification of a vulnerable child here seemed overwhelming.
They said that it was already a credit card that had already caused much trouble because of moving children to the Ted City and not providing enough time to prepare them for the mental - health service or for a good ride to friends.
