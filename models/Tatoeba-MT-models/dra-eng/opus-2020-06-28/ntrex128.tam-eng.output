Welshs are worried about 'm' like women'
There is a problem among some AM people that should be changed as MWPs (WWP members) should be replaced.

The law on reforms included other changes in the way the law works, including regulations and procedures of the body.
When settling the law, AMA will get the final statement for the question how you should be called.

For the past two years, I have received countless suggestions on how to remain flexible and not to express myself.
But I did not go to politics for that.
With the disregard for the King, I became a schoolboy 32 years ago and joined the Laer party.
I never conceal my politics, including the last choice.

I have a message for my group of people, not for the state of Washington, D.C., or for my group of people. I am proud of their service. I assure you that my work is never a threat to you, nor any political environment.

John Edward: World’s Global Language Needs Language
Scotland's independent schools are continuing to promote the best education. There's been in 2018 with the best courses of art, art, music, and other social activities that have come with individual and collective effort.
With 30,000 students from Scotland, these schools, which are adopted by the Scribal of Free Schools, offer the best service for the students and their parents.
In addition to making the best educational preparations of their students, free schools provide them with the opportunity to build their industry and convert them into global subjects.
As an educational organization develops the design and procedures of a school, new languages are becoming more popular in schools.
Nelson Montagu said: “If a man speaks to him in language that he understands, he gets understanding.
If he speaks in his own language, his heart reaches him.
A powerful reminder is that the English could not rely solely on the English to build relationships and to gain hope from other countries.
From the choice of this year, we can see that there are high levels of languages in independent schools with high rates of language.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received a high grade A.
According to data received from the SCIS in 74 member schools, 72 percent of the major students in Madrid appear to be a high grade A, 72 percent learning German, 69 percent learning French, 69 percent learning French, and 63 percent of the Spanish languages.
This reminds us of Scotland’s freedom schools to teach the basic skills of foreign languages to children and young people without doubt.
In schools with free school projects, the LEM lessons (consistent, technology, engineering, and mathematics) can be seen as a key factor.
In a discussion conducted by the UK Commission, which was sponsored by the UK Commission for the year 2014, those who fill spaces are saying that there is a 17 - percent reduction of language.
Therefore, language is very important to young people for future careers.
For the best trade opportunities of language, language is essential in a world of globalization.
If you choose any trade, the second language will be useful throughout your life.
The ability to communicate directly with humans from foreign lands is self - defeating to a man who has a number of languages.
According to Yoo Gov, a consideration of the 4000 UK youths conducted in 2013, 75 percent of the people could not speak foreign languages. 15 percent of the young people could speak French only.
This is why the investment of language is important to children today.
In many languages, in developing economic conditions, this method will prepare the children to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school differs from every school in the languages they teach.
With the goal of teaching several schools to teach new languages, other schools show the desire to teach the languages that are important to the mayor, as in the Japanese, in the year 2020.
No matter what your children’s preferences may be, there will be many languages in which they can learn in the schools and at the workplace.
Scotland’s freedom schools provide the environment in which they can help in the future and the ability to win.
It is not to be denied that language is important in the development of the country and in the global business environment, and it should be reflected in education.
In addition, modern languages need to be considered "Preparatoral Communication".
Freedom schools will give the young of Scotland’s vastness and ability.
I'm fuminatory friar.

2018 Sunbird: The American team tries to save the hope that the U.S. team has placed on them in a Sunday soccer match
It seems that after three major contests, the competition between four teams on Saturday afternoons may provide the needed prospect of a Ranger cup.
Spring player is a fast game, only a single player playing, and there is no other player like that.
So where do they now view opportunities?
"They were in front of six points, but now they are four points, so we have little chance." Jordan said:
At the rest of the twelve games, the European team is at the front of four points, so their chances are greater.
According to Severino, Americans have little chance on their side, and both Spear and Justin Thomas have taken three points to encourage them.
Sébastien, a former champion of sports, left Tudo Green.
During his tour, there was an excessive party, playing ball on the four corners, and he and Thomas reached the goal in two separate periods.
The 15th day of the victory was marked by an extreme celebration, and the victorious Americans were convinced that it was worth it.
He said, ‘Indeed you were concerned about your game, and were anxious.’
All these players are gone now.
18 points are a target to win.
Only two Francisco Molly and Domund have more points in the unsolved experience of the Ranger cup in the past two days than Spey and Mamams.
Europe’s foremost partnership pair had four points four to a degree.
On Saturday afternoon only the couple who didn't get a hamlet, but they missed Saturday and Friday, and then they got nine points.
Their wisdom and ability stirred the audience, and on Sunday they were victorious, and no other prominent soldiers could be able to support the European conquest at the end of the Cold War.
Both had points at the same time.
Europe’s success, however, must be spoken of, even if it is too high.
In the early morning they had four ball games, joined the Vaca Vaughans and Alex No.
The goal was to reach as close to the victory line for the Boypody and friend of the Spanish Spanish and Americans.
On Sunday no one helps you get the points.
With a close look at understanding, counseling, and immediately adjusting techniques, it was a delight to see for Forbe and Fort.
The European team has come to play especially well on the last day, but because of the great American team of tourists, it became favorable to them without doubt.
On the last day of the line file, the European team plays the focus of 10-6 points.
By holding the points 10 -6 in a series of against the U.S. Forbe and the Forum competition on Saturday, the urchure team gets a healthy start on the last day of the fire.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “the number of people living in the developing world has increased from 10 percent to more than 1 percent of the world’s population. ”
To keep the cup that they lost two years ago, Thomas Jordanan’s European team dominated the U.S. soccer team and conquered the sequence of three - and - a - half - year - olds.
In the course of a series of four classes, the American team won two contests, but they could not balance the points.
In order to keep the file, the Jim Futurist team needed eight points in 12 odd contests that will take place on Sunday.
Fluid was the first European player who won four points in a series of four points, and he and Molly were called “Molvet, ” after a united weekend session, and there were only four pairs who won the Moon from the beginning of history four points.
After the Battle of Valdères and Patrick Rehmeet defeated their four balls, they plunged Wweds and American Bridson Nombo with determination in 534 points.
Woltz, who from time until the two contests held Saturday, showed intelligence, but now he has failed in his 29 contests with a series of four balls and fours.
Justin Roses, who spent the morning at the race of four ball games, and then failed with Henryson Johnson, who held the first and the third places around the world at Forts.
Europe did not make it on a beautiful, southern island.
The main winner, Jordan Smith and Justin Thomas, set the goal of the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They succeeded in fighting in a four - ball contest by John Rymachus and Ian Pauler, and then fell down to the figure Paul and Roy McCoy had lost two points at the outset.
Just twice in history, a team has improved from less than four points per second to one odd area, but they just do it to keep the Finns's file.
It seems, however, that after two days in second place, the protestal attack on Sunday seemed to take an unexpected turn.
"No way" says North Korea that without hope it becomes an unsolvable weapon.
In the United States, held on Saturday, the minister of the Ministry of Education in North Korea said that the continuing economic restrictions on the United States would undermine its confidence in the United States, and there would be no other way to reduce the country’s nuclear weapons as a result of such circumstances.
In the last year, Jong Homo reported in the United Nations General Assembly that the North Korea, nuclear and nuclear tests, to eliminate nuclear testing, to guarantee that there is no increase in nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said: "We received no answer from the United States.
"We can't trust in their national security without any trust in America, and under such circumstances, we have no choice but to use their weapons first."
It is noteworthy that, in view of the gradual intervention of nuclear weapons, it can be appreciated that here is a major reason why Röding has returned charges against Washington, although his report is important, since, as in the past, it has not been abandoned by a nuclear law of law, as in the case of the U.S.
Rudi, a member of the United States Supreme Court of the United States, held June 12 in Singapore and mentioned a joint report published by Kim Young and Don Dumong Dummont that the task would be to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
The Korean War of the 1950 -53 called for a fair decision in North Korea, but Pyongyang had to abandon his nuclear weapons first, according to the United States.
Washington also faced severe international bans on North Korea.
And he said, "The extent of opposition is increasing by economic restrictions, that the policy of putting off nuclear weapons is to increase the extent of opposition, and that it is facing the end of them."
"The dream of people who don't know about us is that material restrictions can weigh us down.
But the problem is that a series of economic obstacles add to our disbelief.
At the beginning of this week, Régis mentioned no plans for the Supreme Court of the United States between the United States and the United States.
Instead, Thomas J. J.
President Debrep, President Indim, called the "Randt Man" attack by Kimm bombers in North Korea, after he said that the Rockies of North Korea had a direct basis for avoiding the U.S. law office in Melbourne, U.S.A., when R.
Last year, the Red Cross said, "I'll destroy North Korea." He commended him for his courage to take up arms in the United States, but he said that there must be more work to do until North Korea is completely abandoned.
He also said that on Wednesday there was no time for it. He said: "It may be two years, three years, or five months, and it's no problem."
China and Russia state that the United Nations Security Council should offer a reward for the activity of Bioang.
Nevertheless, on October the U.S. secretary - general of the United Nations stated: “The Security Council must keep up with the economic limits of the nuclear weapons, and to the full, complete, and final analysis. ”
Since 2006, the Security Council has waged economic restrictions on North Korea in an effort to curb the financial burden of the Bioangang Raangang nuclear and Psychic missiles.
During the United Nations General Assembly alone, Pedro Ricci said that he would go back to Bangangang next month to prepare for the second convention.
He has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey is not exactly right.
In July, he went out of Bethany, saying, "I'm going to make powerful demands" in order to condemn him.
North Korea, on the three - month visit to the United States, confirmed that if the U.S. "acts" would be taken out of space and nuclear space.
He said to himself, he said, that the security measures and relationships with Washington were designed to shape Washington.
Harvard students take a lesson in providing adequate rest
Hardy students take the lesson of a new song introduced at Harvard University this year, and all the graduating students get a good night’s sleep, and this is a little against the growing trend of drinking coffee all night.
One student found that students at the world’s first high university in the world had little idea of how to care for themselves.
Charles Sssler, a professor of heart medicine at Harvard Medical School, designed this song, which he believes was first designed in America.
After giving a conversation about the impact that sleep had on learning, he obtained the incentive to start the song.
At the end of the conversation, a woman came to me and said, "Why is this to me this year I'm going to be educated?"
He said no one told him about the importance of sleep-- and he said it surprised me.
This first lesson, which began this year, explains how good sleep habits help the students to develop and improve their general well - being.
According to Dr. Paul Parra, a professor of mental - health services at Harvard Medical School and director of health services, the university concluded that students lose serious sleep within weeks after they have found that students lose sleep.
This program, carried on by an hour - long, contains a series of cross - references.
In one section there is a picture of a room room where they draw a picture of the effects of cafestol and light, and they add coffee cans, curtains, and books to the students to tell them how the process of sleeping is affected and how the rest of the bed is maintained.
In another section, participants tell how a prolonged sleep can increase the risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the complex, having a impact on one, encourages participants to think about their day - to - day routine.
We know this won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to choose - you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke, and Professor Sesler said.
And he said, "I'm still proud of the y-raying culture, which is still on the rise in technology and the increasing pressure on students, a growing problem.
You have enough sleep, to have a good quality, a student has to be a ‘ dangerous weapon ’ to fight stress, depression, and depression, he said, even to avoid weight loss, so that you can keep your sleep from getting tired, so that you can continue making them.
The 19 - year - old Californiaer Rammer Sollard, a 19 - year - old Catholic studying chemistry and physics, helped design the project, and in his first year at Harvard, he took one of his classes in his first year of study.
He said that song opened her eyes and moved her to a full - scale song.
He believes that in the next phase, all back students will be asked to complete a similar study program before they join the sports company.
Professor Chessler recommended that students analyze when to go to bed and when to get up, that they have to be careful about the bad effects of Electra's bureaucracy and L.E.
Livingitian 1 - 0 Rangers: The Mega - knuckle brought defeat to the Germany team
Another sad day for Rérères was when another line failed in Livija Meinenstein’s unconstitutional team.
After the victory of February 4 - 1 in St.
The Röntgens were found to be low because they did not know that they could adjust it for about half an hour before it was too late.
Since the Rangers now descend to the sixth floor, Lividstein went to the third floor, where there is a contrast to his reach of Hiberbernian.
Since he deliberately threw away something far away, Lesne, a licensed surgeon, may have had a further problem with people who suffered the wound on the head.
Gerd made eight changes in his team, and this was sent by a ten - year - old girl to a sports match.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, which received a point from Horst last week, and he would have been delighted to see how his well - lit clothes saved their opponents every time.
Röntgen may have been dominated by Röntstein, but Liviszszsz died in his battle.
Megain's first time, the La-Aydin, they must've been checkin' for two minutes when he sent the Skat bit off the Kiklar. But the Mitphel took his big chance and pulled it to the widest point.
The deep giggle Geogis was found to be a sprig, but by the time he was a rival team, he was able to have only one drink in the back of his face at the back of the bus.
They tried to control the Rangers, but at the end of the third stage, it seemed that their hope was more than hope for their game.
Alfredo Morel, of the University of California, decided that he would have a good time in line with his own mother and Stephen Lassz ’ fighting, but the policy of the Koreans was dismissed.
There were only two to two shots in the target, but the former Ibali Koller, Caleb Coleman, met with a knife that hit Los Angeles with a hand - and a rough cypress of Ovéricia.
No one could deny that Livid’s 34 - minute notice may have been given evidence against opposers, since no one could deny that they were worthy for their deception.
Once again Rörgers failed to deal with a deep Jackies set-up.
Scott Archfift showed no reaction when he placed his ball to the scanners, and he remained calm for a simple conclusion.
In exchange for Ryan Kent’s handgun, Gerry introduced opposition during the interval, resulting in a dramatic turn of events in Madagascar, but he did not stop his vision.
But Lividstein continued to attract them, playing the ball between Likoko and the hall, playing the same game that the audience could enjoy to the end.
Holliet’s team managed to carry the ball to the final stages, but the macaroni was very good in preventing him from taking the Lico ball from the corner.
In the end, however, he was forced to flee to the capital, where he was forced to flee for his life. The Röntgenss instead of Glen’ss team had a problem with him, and another time they demanded the good luck, but Thompson turned his back on his face.
BOLITAL: Kirker’s invention
Now we can start with the "Scroll on Sunday" page of the battle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, exactly today, the future physicist Jonathan Wilkins was born in Germany.
Kirkner developed a method of measuring radiation, and because of this discovery, he eventually became known as the Kirar Commander of the device.
Gear Commander's discovery is significant in the scientific achievements of science, and the film “Bees of Corndo, ” which appeared in the 1950 ’ s, was designed to be modeled by scientists Rogers and Daniels:
Man: "Where is it in this world?"
Rogers: "The method promised to find radiation particles like chlorine.
When you wear these fuels, you may well hear the results of the nuclear reactions in fruits.
"Yes, it's well expressed."
He died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his discovery has established his name.
New cancer vaccine has been discovered in cells within'avoided.
The new cancer vaccine was discovered by discovering the cell's cells and removing the damage and increasing the immune response.
The vaccine is a part of kiblobin, identifying the cells within the cell and increasing the immune forces
This time the disease divides the cells from the patient and reverses the process of converting them to research
They saw a kind of 's tower' in different cancers, resuming it again.
Test vaccines show the results of a variety of cancer patients.
After a woman’s 'economic' cells with cancer - causing cancer, she was diagnosed with a vaccine to increase her immune response, and her cancer was not seen the next 18 months.
In this way, the patient can divide the immune system from the patients, and in many different cancers commonly known as HER2, he can reuse the protein into the search, resuscitation those cells.
"The results that we have received show that we have received vaccines to give us hope." Professor J.
HER2 “is responsible for the development of different kinds of cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and cancers, ” explained Professor Bertissky.
The same method of transfusion has given a good answer in the form of blood cancer.
After the appearance of the West SNL, Juan started talking about him, wearing a big hat like a detour.

Macleods gave them the data of the GP scanners that the staff just refused to say 'false'
One of his staff on Saturday, Massachusetts, U.S.A.
Los Angeles socialist observers insisted that the action should be taken on teachers and webers.
Waterers reported that "false, lying is a very ugly lie."
The published information appears to have included the Lidde of the U.S. Presidents of South Carolina and White House of Jehovah’s Witnesses and the number of phone calls of the two of them.
Significantly, these information was published on the Internet on Thursday, Thursday, during the trial at the General Assembly of the Supreme Court.

Although he was 48 years old, he didn’t beat anyone with a stock drive shots, he was not an outstanding example for the Dede le Gobble Nadal National Congress, making long - term shots that would miss the goal.
And if the field is alone, it will not be so difficult, and in the ninth contest on Sunday, Michaelson has faced face - to - face with the British Mount Francisco Mover, who joins four events this week with the Taquit.
Since the American team, starting on 12 single sports, has to be a fine start in a single race, and the contest of Michaelson is a very important contest.
Fifi said that he believed in him, yet he did not speak further about this.
He fully understood his responsibility today, and took full advantage of it, and said, “I am ready to fight tomorrow, just as I put my hand on me.”
"He has put his trust in him.
He was very skilled, and he shared much with these groups during the past and into this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two contests.
I also expected more than I had expected, and it was exactly what we wanted.
He wanted to be there, like everyone else."
Michael is overcome by his achievement in the Sunday competition, playing the loud sound game.
This may have been his final visit to the Third Reich, which did not completely agree with his own personal achievements. The Bible says: “The heavens are declaring the glory of God; and of the work of his hands the expanse is telling. ”
The 18 failures, 20 failures, and seven halfs, said Fufi said that he was a little stronger than the wearer.
He explained: "He's funny, funny, funny, funny, funny, and funny. If he's in the team room, he'll be very good."
"I think soldiers go with him and enjoy fun, and this week they've done some fun.
He teaches us a lot across the game."
Europe Captain Thomas Pioon knew that the big line could soon disappear
According to the European Captain Thomas Ponton, the large lair of the day’s single competitions on the moon’s table can easily turn into an uncomfortable sniper, ” he said.
The first time in the race in Vilderura in 1997 was Don Belovis was at the port of São Paulo, and the team had five points in front of the race, but the race was successful only in the 21st century.
In the Friday and last contests, Le Lowell's in love, 10-3, and 5-3, and after winning 2018, he said, "We got a big elevator in Vallérma; we got a big elevator here in Brooklyn, where we saw we won the victory, and we won the town.
So history will remember me and all those in the team, and it is not yet possible.
We need to make good use of our full potential tomorrow.
Show your full potential, and do the right things.
This won't happen until you get the desired points on the board.
We have the goal and the objective to try to conquer this cup, which will be our only concern.
From the beginning, I'm telling you, I'm focusing on the 12 men on our property, and we've got to know on another level, the best of opponents.
He said that I am glad that his soldiers played on the giant Couloff Plain were playing, and he said: “I will not let myself be able to do what I can.
The day - to - day competition will be a different party.
Each person’s abilities should bring light to the light, and that is a different thing to do.
When everything is right, playing with a partner is a wonderful feeling, but when you are alone, you will test your full capacity as a Golf soldier.
What you need to tell the soldiers clearly is your full potential tomorrow.
Now leave your partner, let him play alone, and let him express his skill.
In contrast to Bebeon, an opponent, Jim Furyy, expects to play better than his athletes play alone, avoiding the fathers of Jordan Spont and Justin, who have three four points.
Fury was in two of the most unexpected changes, and he had a surprise in America, and he won Europe, so he was on the winning team in Brooklyn before he became a French defeater.
He answered, "I remember every word."
"We have 12 important competitions tomorrow, and I want to give you a wonderful start, as you saw in Brooklyn.
In the same direction, it can cause great stress in the middle of the race.
We've set up our order, we're down the right soldiers we realize, and we've been dealing with some of the major competitions tomorrow."
Thomas handles the task of trying to succeed, and in the dock, he meets José Roses, John Rymel, and Tom Felt, to do so, in one of the other end of the Tatar line, including Paul Idita and other Europeans.
"I'm mixed up with those in this line." I think this is a way to win all the way."
Reconstruction of Germany’s New War — Reconciliation Back
Instead of the old Cold War, the New Bangs must have been changed in Germany in 2014, but it could not even be the same as the next year because of the wrong mines and prices.
A military reporter said that the ship, the main of the New Battalburg-Pelgat, has been driven from half the year 2019 to the year 2019.
The ship must have been on board until 2014, but thanks to previous issues of delivery, it has been on a major project.
In 2007, at the sea, there were four banding ships that flew into the four pirate ships, and the old Bremen's old Bremen will be converted to the Bremen-wars.
It is possible to understand that they contain sound technology, such as a system and a system of electromagnetic and antiaircraft missiles, which are organized and reduced to a series of electromagnetic missiles, such as radio, radio, and sound system.
In other important areas, long - term care is likely to be impossible, even if the new warships are suspended from local ports for two years.
However, by the continuing delay, better wars will be due to the time they have already entered foreign service, which is said to be a lesson for Germany as a lesson for foreign nations.
When the German pirate officer refused to use the war, and returned it to the Home of Lot and Vassi in Hamburg, the last year the F125 was a war without good luck.
This was the first time that a ship was returned to the construction company after the delivery.
The reasons for this restoration had come to light, but the German media reported that the battle had a number of important “power and software errors ” and that the war would be useless by use of military activity.
The number of softwareships was very important, since the band of 120 sailors were run through a group of ships. The number of these ships was half of the workers in the old Bremen-blank.
Moreover, it was discovered that the ship had a greater weight of weight to reduce its activity and that it was likely that it would be unable to add any other cargo to the ship’s future.
It's estimated that in World War II the weight of 7,000 tons was as much as double as those of Germans used by the Germans.
The cost of a personal project, including the training of a ship’s crew, also becomes a problem.
This is said to be rising from .2.2.2 billion in billion in billion (3.6.6b).
In view of recent warnings from the decline of Germany’s navigational ability, the problems in new wars have been particularly changing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Birther Barlets, head of the German relief committee, acknowledged that there are few "useable ships" to use on the coast.
This complex is on the rise every day, since the official has said that the old ships are going to be unable to use them, and the new ships are not offered for substitutes.
He's sorry that any of the banding ships were worthless to join in the ship.
National Dictionnaire, who oversees the secret life of bats
A new research is being begun in a hospital in the Scranton Hills, in the Smithsonian Hills, to demonstrate how bats use the land to search for their food.
It is hoped that the results of research will provide new information related to the act of flight - by - individual mammals and help them to cope with future security measures.
Scientists at the National Park of Scotland study the common and the sobbbs and the long - brown tails of sheep and dreary tails in the West Indies on the West Indies.
Special recorders will be applied in the main places of the forest all over the sun to monitor the function of bats throughout the sanctimonious forests.
The NHS staff and volunteer workers perform mobile services using electronic devices.
The expert of all records will discover the frequency of the sound of the bats and what life is doing.
A map and a report will be prepared to explain how their activity on the ground is illustrated.
Rocker, a natural security adviser for NTS, believes that any areas of life that are important to the bats and how they are used by each species are used.
This information will help us to determine how we can better care for beauty benefits, such as the creation of grass, bats, and other life - sustaining creatures.
The total number of bats in Scotland and the United States has dropped dramatically in the last 100 years.
They are threatened by the building and development of birds that affect their habitat and also lose their habitat.
The air bubbles and clammy threat, and the insect - killing paper and some of the chemical products in the building - in - building, and the attacks of pet - raise cats are a threat to the animal population.
The bats are not really blind.
However, since they are searching for food at night, they use their ears more than their eyes do to catch the prey.
They use a sophisticated radio station to identify insects and bans on their flight route.
More than 270 historical buildings are deeply concerned about NTS, which is responsible for the safety of 38 important gardens and 76,000 headlands of the country.
There are ten trained experts, who perform surveys in the grassland, and sometimes even participate in relief activities.
The company has set up a set of eight species of bats, which is the home of the ten - species of Scotland’s first and 15 species of bats.
According to the report, “the most important thing is to get rid of the wild animals, ” and“ if you have to work with them, you’ll have to work with them. ”
He said, “We have a fine place for the bats in the morning.”
"The old buildings have more old trees and a better living place.
Yet, there are many things we do not know about the bats, and our work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about the needs of the bats.
Before taking care of the air, he emphasizes that it is important to check the earth’s surface because destruction of a single field can cause the death of 400 female bats and younger bats, which will destroy almost every member of the species.
It is a legal offense to kill bats and kill them, to persecute them, or to cause trouble or to destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Feldler, a Swedish official for the Vaca Protection Traveler, urged the public to help.
He said: "We still have much to learn about bats and many of our natural creatures, and we don't know how their numbers are falling down."
Ronaldo’s prosecutors filed a complaint on the German Journal, refusing the branches related to rape
Christian Roncardo said that the rape branches that were written against him were called "false News" and, using his name, he said, "Landers want to make themselves famous." His lawyers have filed a case with the German press on the Democratic Spain press.
Christian Roncardo said that the rapes written against him were "false news" and, using his name, they wanted to make a name for themselves.
The war in Portugal and the World War II in 2009 has been blamed for the rape of a young American woman named Karako in the Los Angeles Hotel.
On Friday, Tell Sussex reported that he agreed to give him $375,000 so that he could avoid any further trouble.
Within a few hours after the news on the branches was published, Josephdo, 33 years old, spoke with his 332 million Forlers on the video, and he announced the news "false News".
"No, no, no, no.
Today, the message they publish is a false message.
"and they want to be known by my name.
This is a regular one.
They want to be known by my name, but this is their job.
I'm happy, everything happens well." The quarterman laughed.
In connection with these charges, Dr. Rondo's attorneys are ready to go to trial on Teller Spicle, which announced that it was “an unremarkable thing to receive a message of doubt about personal matters. ”
This may be one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years, and the prosecutor has said that the victim may ask for the losses of “the loss of moral reputations associated with gross violations. ”
The accused incident is said to have taken place in San Francisco in Los Angeles, Texas, in 2009.
According to documents presented at the Court of Clermont in Nepal, after meeting with the judge of the Council of Churches, it was announced that both Ronald and Mavira went to the room and raped him there.
The minister said that he had made a mistake by saying, "99 percent of the good man" and that he had made an innocent mistake.
According to the newspaper Le Monde, “the number of suicides among women in the United States has increased dramatically. ” In the document, Ronaldo stated that they had both engaged in sexual intercourse, but this took place with the exception of two.
The minister said that he went to the police and had photographed his injuries in the hospital, since after the St.
A 34 - year - old magiciana says that he has been severely injured because of the crime he has been emotionally wounded, seeking a way to avoid the semester.
Ronald was at the time he was accused of rape, and in the summer he was in the Italian Democratic Republic of the state of Manchester, which was joined in this summer deal.
The function which exits from the European Union: if you lose car manufacturers, it'll have to be sorry for ever.
After Yukie left the European Union, if he lost his position in car production, then U.S. secretary - general, U.S.
To Pinatubo, in his own statement, said that if Britain left the European Union without a contract, he would have to stop production of their factory in the Berlin area, which is near Berlin. He said, "The pain is painful."
Mr. Clark said, "We want a divorce."
According to the Japanese car manufacturer, if there are delays in the arrival of a treaty from Britain, the result may result in unemployment.
Barnanatist, the production of the gas and gas in Tokyo, has produced about 300,000 cars last year, 90% of them being exported to other parts of the European Union.
"If Britain departs from the European Union at the end of the month, we'll stop production in our factory."
Other U.S. cars, including Hoda, Bmachwood, and Jack Leper, have revealed their fear of leaving the Soviet Union without knowing how the agreement works.
For example, BMW said that a month after Britain’s departure from the European Union, he was going to close his small business in Oxford.
A major problem is that car manufacturers say there are problems in the brain if Britain leaves without agreements and moves out of the European Union.
Toyota's production is based on "Jed-in", and parts of the car that comes up for car production every 37 minutes, from Yuji and European union.
On March 29, the treaty states that if Yuji left Europe without a civil agreement, he could interfere on the limit, and the industry could cause delays and problems in obtaining parts.
The company has announced that the production could be stopped, since it is possible for Dorota to keep only more than a day’s insurance in its center.
The trial plan for future relationships with the European Union of Mr. Clark and Teresa Mayesis says that the test is “implies exactly to avoid similar tests. ”
"We have to overcome a deal. We need a better deal, that doesn't mean that it's not just the success we're going to experience right now, but it's always going to take advantage of this opportunity." He said on the Big Big Radio program.
"And other car producers also need to be able to keep up with what they have done before."
The number of people living in the developing world is estimated to be more than a quarter of a million.
Peter Dictionnaires, who works at Barnanatia for 24 years, is a member of the United States team, and he's on the rise: if you leave us once in the experience, they won't come back.
The government press said: “We have recommended a precise and reliable program of our future relationship with the European Union."

Sanders, they told them that the brief news meetings would be held and that if the press had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better to talk to me forever.
We're trying to do it a lot, you've seen us doing it a lot for the last few weeks, and when you can talk with the president of the United States, it's going to take the place of the press conference.
When Time leaves the White House or participates in open - air meetings, he usually responds in response to messages at meetings.
It is not easy to arrange for a reporter to attend a meeting by himself.
In New York this week, the president, perhaps in New York, showed a strange appearance in front of potential reporters, and he showed them why.

The breast - feeding that compares mothers to cows has created a gap on the Internet
A breast - feeding firm has promoted online viewing by advertising that compares breast - feeding to milk - feeding cows.
And during the introduction of the pepper that says "the world's first silent breast-bones", the consumer industry, Elvis, offered the release of this new ball to mothers, the release of the video Ding-in-Sun-Sun-Sun-Sun.
In it, four mothers are dancing with the following song lines in a mutton - "Oh, I'm a dancer, I'm a dancer."
The prize continues: “Sing, cry, I give to the children, and I give to the children, saying, "Sow, cry, cry, I am mourning for my women."
Nevertheless, the advertising printed in the factory of the nation’s factory allowed a huge storm on the Internet.
And 77,000 people looked and saw the video with hundreds of opinions, and they said they were making fun of the "fairs" of the sex industry.
"The worst conclusion is that cows used to advertising this product.
For milk to feed, they must conceive, they must be born as we are, the same difference, and in a few days that they have produced their fats, they go round, ” writes one.
Elvish blog match match closely to the blobs that give breast milk without revealing it.
Another said: "It's so painful for the mother and the child to understand.
Why not use one of them for breast - feeding for mothers who owns the baby?
Another said: "There's no mercy advertising."
Others bought the advertising, and a girl, said, "The advertising was a "good- for-good-for-good-for-good."
"This is a clever idea.
If I were now giving birth, I would have bought one too.
The milking made me feel like a cow.
