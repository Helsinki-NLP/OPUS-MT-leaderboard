Stand up, please.
Who told you my name was Tom?
This is Tom's.

Do I have the right to accompany you?
I couldn't find what you were looking for.
He rarely goes to church.
They get along well with their neighbors.
Didn't Tom say anything about that?
French isn't so hard to learn at all.
I think you've done enough.
When did you start studying French?
I'll come home.
No one else suggested to help.
Take your coat.
It was hard for him to breathe.
I'll make you happy.

What do you want?

Now that I'm registered, what am I supposed to do?
Clearly, Americans can't even solve their own problems, so how do they even imagine that they are capable of dealing with the problems of the rest of the world?
Speak clear so everyone can hear you.
I've got a botch.
From now on, I'm going to study French more seriously.
Do you have any other questions?
Yesterday was so cold.
I forgot to give him the message.
I finished American literature in college.

If you need anything, just call.
Remember, tomorrow's Tom's birthday.

For dinner, Tom took Mary to a restaurant on the coast of the sea.
You don't have to pay for the apartment in advance.
Let's play tennis this afternoon.
As old as you get, you can always learn.
Are you living in Sasayama?
I wish everything Tom said was a lie.
What's the time tomorrow?
Is there any children?
Don't open those windows.
I always enjoy listening to you singing.
Can you come tomorrow?
The killer could have been stopped.
Don't you think all our politicians are too old?
We can't hide that fact from her.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
Some say French is one of the most beautiful languages in the world.
I like taking pictures.
I'll pay you.
Do you have a car?
Do you like French wine?
You have to keep your promises.
Tom sat on a knot.
The girls danced at the salon.
She's convinced her son is still alive.
Do you have any books in French?
I finally stopped in front of the old house and saw the city again.
You won't see anything without a flashlight.
My dad's a little old-fashioned.
I laughed at his joke.
Your answer is correct.
She wrote a letter.
There are many ways to do one thing.
Anyway, where's Tom?
I have to admit, I'm snoring.
We've been using this insecticide for two years.
Come help me.
Are you sure you don't want anything?
My sister lives near Yokohama.
Oh, very bad!
The bus has arrived empty.
We have to keep helping Tom.
My mom has a nice handwriting.
What day are you usually free?
Tom decided to postpone the meeting.
Tom tied up his shirt and then put on his tie.
It's really cold today, isn't it?
You won't be able to help us.
She's popular, but not because she's beautiful, but because she's being nice to everyone.
Ken plays football every day.
Welcome again at any time.
I don't want tea, I want coffee.
Lawyers and car mechanics are the people I trust at least.
Can you wait outside?
Can you eat raw oysters?
What stopped you from working?
Who's the manager?
What are you asking?
I was convicted.
The train went 500 miles an hour.
She gave me this CD.
The director considered the opportunity to fire Tom, but he decided not to.
I have to take it off.
Tom sat by the window.
I don't think you really want to do this.
Most of the students were from the West Coast.
Could that be love?
I'll eat it here.
Tom has two kids.
The police shouldn't take bribes.
I was in the mountain.
That's what I said.
You're lying, aren't you?
Travelers in southern Germany will see farms with solar panels wherever they can look.
Don't look in the box.
You're running.
I heard the phone ringing.
That's why I can't believe it.
He was angry that nobody said anything.
Tom is the only student in our class who can speak French.
I'm sorry I misunderstood your plans.
I'll ask you to translate this report to French.
No one's confused.
Everybody jumped.
Many traders were robbed during the riots.
Why do I have to learn French?
She's not tall.
It's true!
We thank you for your help.
Since we've been wearing clothes, we don't know each other.
Let's get started.
He visited his uncle yesterday.
Tom's shorter than the average.
I found the key.
I know this is important.
My aunt who lives in Tokyo sent me a beautiful shirt.
It's delicious.
You have a lot of friends who are worried about you.
I don't have any pencils.
I don't know Tom so well.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
You're drunk.
That's partly true.
He's been living here for the last ten years.
I have socks, but I don't have shoes.
Shit.
She calls me Kenji.
I have the information you asked for.
In a mysterious way, the sense of humor is related to national features.
Swimming is one of the things Tom likes to do.
He'll be back tomorrow.
He forgot to feed the dog.
I need to study things.
I'll watch you.
I used to want to be astrophysic.
Tom vomited blood.
This camera is Tom's.
I'm sick.
I really appreciate your help.
I bought a red tie.
You want me to cut it a little bit?
It's a book.
I have to do everything Tom tells me.
You can do it, come on, I'm with you.
Did Mike stop drinking?
Aren't you glad to see me?
I really couldn't have done it without you.
I'm not mad at you, I'm just very disappointed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
Did you and my little sister leave at the same time?
The match was postponed for a while.
His brother learns a lot.
Ken arrived in Kyoto.
Have you seen Tom?
I wish I was taller.
Do many people visit the museum?
The thieves robbed the museum.
He's crazy about you.
He comes from inside to speak French.
Tom helped Mary put on his coat.
That Kabuki book could be expensive.
I'm sorry.
Is this your book?
I've always wanted to learn French.
Will you call Tom, or do you want me to?
Don't be afraid of Tom.
He leaned on his elbows.
What's the minimum wage in England?
Maybe we should tell Tom he's the opposite.
What is the minimum wage in New Zealand?
I'm on his way with him for the price.
You can speak French, right?
My dad smokes rarely.
His vain attempts to mislead her, showed him that he had the wrong address; she was the mother of two children.
I lost him.
She made the doll for me.
What's in the bottle?
I heard everything you just said.
We're soul mates.
The boss is very upset.
That doesn't change anything.
I have a date with him at noon.
The invitation said there would be popcorn and no alcohol drinks.
Tom looks pale.
I hope that helps.
What did you find?
I think we should get out of here.
I've worked with Tom for a long time.
He's much older than Ken.
Where are the showers?
Mike runs so fast yesterday.
Do you have a European healthcare card?
None of the balls are yellow.
I know a guy you need to meet.
I was rude.
Kuala Lumpur is worth visiting.
I couldn't get them to understand me.
You speak French, too?
I just recently started studying French, so I'm not very good.
These gloves belong to Tom.
Where's the entrance?
Tom's trying to get an answer from Mary.
A boy, not over five years old, asked Tom how to get to the mail.
Tom still lives with his parents.
Sometimes we meet them.
I think Tom's asleep.
Are those explosives?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you company.
Anne has no sisters.
Tom has small hands.
He arrived two days earlier.
Did you have a nice trip?
He made me a suit.
Men make houses, women - homes.
Where's the bathroom?
They usually come home before us.
I don't know what to say.
I'm your brother.
I won't be able to get Tom on the bridge.
If I were you, I'd apply for this job.
The patient was released from the hospital.
My Internet connection is slow.
We have to keep working.
We're gonna be late.
How long do you have to wait?
I'm smarter than you.
I was fascinated by her opera singing.
You'll find him.
Don't fall in love with me.
Who's with Tom now?
His concert was very good.
There's another number of tourists here.
The door clicked and closed.
I'm hungry!
It's easy to talk to Tom.
Brothers twins look exactly like each other.
Don't hang out with Tom.
I didn't get the laughter.
I bet you know that.
It's cold.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
Keep your mouth shut.
Would you repeat that, please?
How much money do you have?
And I was sick.
I have a lot of bad news.
Have you seen the uncensored version?
Considering how much time I learn French, I should be able to speak it better.
Let me introduce you to Tom.
I have to admit, I'm a little nervous.
You want to buy a shirt?
I think you have the right not to let Tom go.
Tom accepted the invitation to visit Mary's party.
You won't be alone in there.
I heard what they said.
This story ends happily.
I'm mad at myself.
This was done by Tom alone.
You won't believe what things people throw away.
I stopped smoking for a year.
He doesn't carry much luggage when you're traveling.
I've got Tom's picture here.
I didn't tell you everything.
They both work.
Tom's not welcome here.
You accused her of lying to him.
There's no point fooling yourself, you know, she's playing games with you.
George is very enthusiastic about his new job.
It was fun.
He gave his camera to his friend.
He needs to be given advantage in front of the others.
I moved you.
Take him with you.
Wait a minute.
I swim once a week.
I waited an hour and a half.
He mocked me in public.
The bulb's burnt.
Tom worked very hard.
How much money do you need?
Oh, I was sick.
We're in position.
Slow it down.
How about we have dinner together?
I think you lied to me.
That's amazing.
Where's the bus terminal?
If it wasn't for me, Tom wouldn't be here.
This is the picture I took on Tom's house.
That's not our problem.
I never spoke French to Tom.
We all assumed that Tom could speak French.
Tom's back inside.
Who's Tom talking to?
I'd like to learn more about museums.
This shirt needs to be washed.
You won't believe it.
I'm looking for a house.
I don't feel well.
Why are you early?
He decided to go abroad.
I don't blame you.
I'm a nightbird.
I'm glad you think so.
Mary looks like her mother.
You agree with Tom, don't you?
Do whatever you want, but I'll stop him if I can.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
I have to trust Tom.
I think I'm gonna learn how to swim during the holiday.
Where's the beach?
Do Giants play tonight?
I feel like he's not gonna let me freak out so easily.
It'll be 5:30 in a minute.
School starts at 8:30.
Tom's taking a bath.
The beach is not far from here.
Ken skipped the wall.
The upper part of the mountain is covered with snow.
One hug of you will make me happy.
When are you leaving?
I'm right behind him.
My best friend is a book.
Right next to the beach, there's a really good restaurant I think you'll like.
What made you think that?
I'm coming.
He missed the last train.
I looked at the picture.
You had no choice but to wait for her.
I completely wiped you out of my memory.
I haven't said no yet.
It's not that deep.
I'm not a patient.
You mean French?
I've never seen you so nervous.
What's the minimum salary in Lithuania?
There's the hospital I was born in.

I don't know where I left the keys.
By the way, have you heard from him lately?
Convicted of death.
I want to talk to you about something else.
Tom can't speak French, can he?
I don't have anything.
Think with your head for once.
I thought you might be hungry.
This is the beginning of a new era.
I have to put my shoes on.
I think about it a lot.
You don't have anything else?
I think you're amazing.
Why don't you pick up?
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I finally won his heart.
We had to obey their request.
Pick the one you like.
We'll know soon enough.
You look tired, so go to bed early.
That was so stupid.
We'll be together soon.
I have nothing to offer.
I'm talking to my employees in French.
This is a picture of my sister.
Tom's hard to deal with people like Mary.
I've tried them all.
He gave her some advice.
The room was so crowded, I could hardly breathe.
Mary and Jane are cousins.
He certainly loves you.
I lost my wife last year.
Looks like she's feeling a little unwell.
Did Spot go, too?
I promise I'll bring it back.
I have relatives in Boston.
Get out of here!
Tom's wearing a vest.
Don't look at me!
Don't be disappointed.
I need to go talk to Tom.
How about we study together at the library?
I have a job to do.
The offer for work is still in force.
Your shirt is missing one button.
I need to get out for a minute.
The green suits you.
Stick your thumbs.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Can I see this one?
Uncle gave me that watch.
Real friendship is forever.
Tom's used to working in the open.
Tom pulled the trigger.
Tom and Mary are drunk.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
You're kidding!
Let's go back.
I'm getting on the bus.
Tom teaches French every day.
In this store, they're dealing with kitchen facilities.
I think you made the right choice.
Tom didn't answer right away.
You're supposed to do a good job.
How old is your son?
The girl who works in that bakery is cute.
Please get me another cup of coffee.
Alice might come.
How do you do that?
I had a good time.
I'll stay by the next day.
I don't like artificial flowers.
It's not my fault.
Did any of your team speak French?
Looks like it's gonna start snowing.
I've never seen one like it.
Come as soon as you can.
I've never been on the top of Fuji.
You don't play golf, do you?
Tom's not working anymore.
It's probably nothing important.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
Tom jumped.
What's the minimum wage in France?
I forgot her name.
This political problem has led to hot debates.
Eat a live frog every morning and all the rest of the day won't be any worse.
Tom won't be happy to see you.
Unemployment is growing.
I couldn't blink last night.
Russia lost 20 million people during World War II.
I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Nancy's smiling.
If you're going to France, you have to get your French.
I understand what you're saying.
I never trusted Tom.
We're French at school.
He said so himself.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Do it now.
I won't be able to tell you what happened.
I think you should give up.
Please be patient.
Your joke goes too far.
I had a really good time today.
Christophor Columbus drank unfiltered seawater.
I want to be a French teacher.
I'm glad I don't need that.
They're all hungry.
The Japanese have black eyes.
Tom's a professional baseball player.
Tom wished he was still single.
I have three children.
Let me sleep for ten more minutes.
Uncle gave me the watch.
All horses are animals, but not all animals are horses.
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
I ate pizza every day last week.
I promise I'll bring it back.
I sent Tom home.
Do you have any gum?
I guess you're wrong.
His daughter has become a beautiful woman.
Are you sure you don't want to come?
Fill it up.
Tom's on his desk, writing something.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll call you about Tom.
I opened my check account.
He was here at the time.
I put my shoes on right away.
He felt uncomfortable in his father's presence.
Your shoes are untied.
Tom shouldn't be here.
He took off his coat.
I can swim in the river.
Do you do French every day?
Don't make so much noise, please.
You're pretty good in French, aren't you?
I'm extremely busy.
No one considered his words important.
That's a weird problem.
I don't understand that.
What place do you live in?
I didn't know what to do.
It's time for lunch.
I'm so happy you came.
I haven't made a mistake yet.
Tom's got six.
I did it for you.
I've seen you somewhere.
They'll play basketball after school.
Those clothes look good to you.
I couldn't say no.
That's surprising.
I heard someone coming in.
Are you sure you don't want to come tonight?
Did they take a bus to the museum?
I need to discuss something personal with you.
He was transported to the hospital with a helicopter.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I'm sewing my shirt.
Are you coming?
Don't interrupt me!
I played with Tony yesterday.
Jill's engaged to Jack.
Good luck to you.
He was home alone.
In esperant, the essentials end up on "o". A multitude is formed by adding a "j".
Tom wants to be a doctor when he grows up.
Won't I get a hug?
I'm older than any other student of my class.
I buy tapes.
We're gonna need Tom's help.
How tall is your brother?
Come and visit us.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Jane's in serious trouble.
It was a perfect day.
I haven't showered in three days.
Triangles don't have four angles.
Are you sure you want to know?
I accept your offer.
What is the minimum wage in Romania?
Brian left the door open.
Tom, wake up.
How are you gonna get home?
I wash my clothes.
I've heard French is a hard language.
I didn't eat all the time.
Soon you'll stop thinking about her.
Let me take a look.
I've seen you do amazing things.
Tom works for a big firm.
Say hello to your friends.
Let's ask.
Get up there and go to bed.
Come on, touch it.
That's my job.
Don't touch the ball on the door.
How many years have you studied French?
Carol's back at her hotel.
Do you like that color?
Please be brief.
I haven't seen him yet.
The mountain is covered in snow.
Let's get out of here.
Fuck, I forgot my camera!
He got off the train.
Mary's dating two at the same time.
There's no mention of Tom yet.
Pass it to me.
Did you do everything you wanted?
You'll have to wait and see.
I was awake at 5:00.
I was afraid I might be late.
Tom says he can connect with the dead.
Can you stay?
What do you want?
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Don't talk to me now.
What are you telling me?
I'm looking for something not that expensive.
It's much easier for Tom to speak English than French.
I think you'll be surprised.
Next time, I'll make more effort.
I've done my job already.
He's a hero.
I don't have any requirements.
Her charm is a mixture of joy and kindness.
I should have listened to you.
I have brown hair.
I'll meet you at the park.
I've never won before.
It's just a little bit.
I like that color.
My grandmother was operated in Germany.
I think you should buy this.
I've seen you and Tom.
I don't think that's true.
I have three cameras.
Ask them to call Tom.
We're all sorry about Tom.
I hope I have a chance to return your favor.
Tom went through the drawer to see if there was any pen that he could use.
This requires a careful discussion.
Tom won't believe it.
I have to learn the truth.
I think you should meet Tom.
We ran after the cat.
I'll go if Tom's leaving.
I wish I was young.
Be more specific.
Tom's French is really pretty good.
Isn't the time great?
I don't feel so uncomfortable.
I don't want to belong to elite at all.
I've seen you on TV.
You have to study hard.
I'll be back soon.
Ask Tom yourself.
Tom explained things in detail.
Don't let Tom get away with it.
He played football with an empty can.
I think you'll really like it.
Just close your eyes.
I'm a vacation this week.
My French teacher is my age.
You better put a sweater under your jacket.
Are you sure you don't want to ask Tom for help?
The new production process has achieved good results.
In this, his ignorance is understood.
You're absolutely right.
Everyone knows his name.
My French is not good at all.
I would never hurt them.
Are they criminals?
Can you take six out of ten?
I'm too busy to help him.
You can see her in the morning.
Have fun.
We'll give him a farewell party.
What club are you joining?
Acushi may have been sick.
Tom didn't get on the bus.
Some books are worth reading again and again.
We're working together now.
Go back to your seat.
He graduated Cambridge with an award.
I have to get her back tonight.
I have to get ready.
Did Tom learn French at school?
What shoes are they?
We've definitely worked hard.
I'll postpone my trip to Scotland until it warms up.
He started making excuses.
How old are you?
It's okay.
Where did it happen?
Why is he hiding under the table?
Don't make me do this.
How big are your kids?
I'll stay by tomorrow.
Please call a doctor!
I think Tom can share your feelings.
I gave up.
You and half don't know.
This is the picture I took on Tom's house.
She gave him something to eat.
I'm starving!
I'll help you get better at this.
My dad goes running every morning.
I saw Tom walk on the beach.
My brother became an engineer.
How much money do you want?
Don't get up too fast.
She gave away all her dolls.
I didn't say anything.
What are you gonna do?
I really appreciate it.
I knew you'd be busy.
Go away.
It's a big town.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
Kim's dressed very attractively.
Don't ask me for money.
Tom hates school.
There's no problem creating a website, just be careful not to violate someone's copyright.
Tom defended his wife.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
The fingers on the hand are five: thumb, pointer, middle finger, no name and dog.
The folio is made of polyethylene.
I've decided the ease problem.
Did anyone notice that?
She's a little shy.
Are you sure you don't want me to call Tom?
You're young, but I'm very old.
I haven't started yet.
How much taxi comes out of there?
You both look very young.
You're absolutely right.
Is that yours, Tom?
I don't have many English books.
We have until tomorrow morning.
I like your shirt.
Enthusiasm began his deservingly respectful business.
I've seen you on TV.
We went to the museum.
Who cares about me?
At first, local cowboys laughed at him.
He looks like he's in a hole.
I think you should come see him.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
Be more accurate.
I'm on leave this week.
I wash my socks.
I promise I won't do this anymore.
I just gave blood.
He doesn't speak French or German.
I'm not a traitor.
Are you sure you don't want to keep her?
I don't doubt his honesty.
Please open the package.
I'm buying.
I have no idea who he is.
Could you tell me your name, please?
This kind of mistakes are inevitable.
I don't speak French at all.
Is he watching your game?
This is your home.
Loss was heavy for both sides.
I'll follow your instructions.
He told us a lie.
God gives me happiness.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom tried to convince Mary it was time to leave.
She makes makeup every morning.
Don't forget the party tonight.
Do you prefer to speak French?
Wow, that's cool.
Don't make me look nice.
I don't have any money.
Millie eats bread.
I have other plans for Tom.
I couldn't do this without you.
Tom's not used to living in the city.
Keep an eye on Tom.
Jane went out shopping.
This cake is nice.
I told Tom why I couldn't go.
The long fields are now demode.
He's doing very well with kids.
Come in, please.
We really had fun.
Tom hates that.
It's true she's dead.
Don't get used to it.
Finally, it stopped raining snow and the weather warmed up.
She did not particularly light insights what she wanted for Christmas.
Students didn't remember what they read in this book.
I learn French every day.
I heard every word of it.
Where did you take your socks off?
Let's go to the movies.
Looks like Tom decided to stay.
Tom won't give up.
Some poisons used correctly are useful.
What are we gonna eat?
Keep it a secret.
You make me feel so guilty.
I'm mad at you.
Let's do it.
She gave me permission to use her dictionary.
He's three years older than her.
Don't hope very much.
What's the cost of this umbrella?
Mom, will you pass me the toilet paper?
How'd it go?
I think you'll find him.
I was expecting you last night.
Looks like you changed the whole room.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tom showed Mary several effective ways to learn French.
I'm not good with sports.
The judge sentenced him to death.
That tall man is Mr. Smith.
That was pretty good.
I really didn't expect Tom to make it.
I found out he's a chemistry genius.
You can't just as you're going in and out of here, you're starting to abuse people's address.
I had a meeting at 2:30, but I got in traffic and I couldn't make it in time.
They went to the sea museum.
Tom is trying a lot to improve his French.
A lot of time was lost in vain.
They didn't talk.
I didn't call you an idiot.
I want to speak French today.
Can you tell me what to do?
Are you sure you don't want me to buy you a ticket?
They're not that bad.
I'm careful.
Don't take it in.
We're all connected.
One word of support when you fail is worth more than an hour of gratitude when you succeed.
Are you sure you don't want me to take you home?
It was finished.
His shirt was dirty with sauce.
Tom found Mary's story interesting.
Mary Tom won't get any help.
You won't be protected anywhere.
She wore a leather coat.
I promise I won't do it again.
I made Ann a doll.
What's your degree, Tom?
I thought you'd be tired.
The story is very interesting to me.
I've read this book.
That was a good year for you.
It was cleaned up.
I can't do this.
I'm a French teacher.
I want to buy Tom a present.
One thing is certain, no one can stop me!
She can speak French.
He's a friendly man.
I was convicted.
Tom was told recently that he had cancer.
Tom came home with a bus.
For me, a meeting this afternoon is a better option.
What do you have to do?
Tom studied French three hours last night.
Pick up your hand.
What's that?
It was too easy.
I travel a lot.
Here's the hospital I was born to.
I never liked biology.
I owe you so much for your kindness.
Let's divide the prize fifty to fifty.
Squeeze my hand.
I'd like to buy the car you're selling, but I don't have enough money right now.
Tell me about Tom.
I think you better lie down.
I haven't seen Tom since his birthday.
I need to know.
Do you like traveling?
Your plan failed.
Tom made a big party in his house while his parents were on vacation.
I was forced to leave school.
I just finished breakfast.
I have to go help Tom.
It happened once.
How long will you have to wait?
Tom's the guy who told me when to meet.
I appreciate your cooperation.
Soldiers started coming home.
I have a problem, I need your help.
Let's get on the bus.
Are you coming or not?
Tom didn't want Mary playing with his kids.
I forgot to tell him.
Nancy seems so tired.
I really appreciate the offer.

Do you feel guilty?
Do you think so?

She was cold.
Tom speaks French accent.
I've never seen a rainbow.
Ken can swim, right?
Tom and Mary went to the park.
I thought it was best not to say anything about it.
I'm not a student.
Do you see closely?
A few minutes later, the phone rang.
She wasn't even there.
Jane's from Australia.
Close the door, please.
Tom finally left.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
That's the sweetest puppy I've ever seen.

I think Tom's afraid of you.
Why did you run?
What's your favorite bird?
You can study here.
Let me help you.
You'd love to!
I'm afraid I hurt you.
There's nothing to worry about.

It's a long story.
We solved the problem.

Has anyone ever told you that?

Don't let him do it.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
I put my coat on the table.

See if you turned off the TV before you fell asleep.
And my hands were trembling.
From now on, be more careful.
Tom jumped into the cold water.
Are you registered?
If there's no life after death, you better do something with this life.
I hope things work out for you, Tom.
Let me help you.
Don't let yourself be used.
I think you're the ones who need help.
The corridor is slippery, be careful.
Languages such as Russian, Polish, Czech and Bulgarian have common Slovenian roots.

I want to see you.
I'm not jealous.
We used to drive.
Can I get your coat?

Tom can't see you.
I bet you're busy.
Come and see us.
Looks like you've had a rough day.
Tom's not giving up.
But I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I need to talk to you.
I don't believe that at all.
I haven't talked to Tom yet.
Are you involved?
What did you do with the camera?
I kept filming.
Today, less teenagers work.
Why am I still listening to that?
Please, don't.

Tom's injured!
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
Can we trust her?
That's the camera Tom took.
Let's watch TV.
He killed that guy.
Do good to those who hate you.
I have to go.
What's the whole story?
Don't push me.
What are your plans for Christmas?
Another bottle of wine, please.
It's time to go to work.
You were given an opportunity.
Could you put the dishes in the sink?
We found where he lives.
It's not that deep.
He's a great scientist.
She wants a divorce.
The new magazine seemed very interesting to me.
Maybe we can help Tom.

I think Tom's hurt.
Tom helped Mary move the closet.
Tell Tom to explain.
What's your connection to him?

Can you do it yourself?
In the spring, the days are getting longer.
Mary let Tom kiss her.
I've never seen you cry.
Sometimes I hear my dad sing in the bathroom.

That request was rejected.
You were right.
He was tired and still went to help them.

Do as I say.
The kids are already tired.
You want to watch a French movie, right?
We played for victory.
What's in the coffee?
The bulb's burnt.
I have to get Tom's money back.
As many books he has, so do I.

If you listen a little more careful what the teacher says, you'll probably understand.
I think you should check under the bed.
The movie wasn't as funny as the book.
My job didn't drag me.
I think you're perfect.
Every human being is part of all of us called the universe - part that is limited in time and space. It perceives itself, its thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical illusion of his consciousness. This illusion is a sympathetic prison for us, restricting us within our personal desires and affection to our closest people. Our task should be to free ourselves from this prison, expanding the circle of our compassion, so that it covers all living creatures and nature in all and beauty.
He'll certainly come.
I know.
You're not going?
He arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
Do I have to fill out this form in French?

Looks like he's happy.

Why is this so funny?
Follow my example and get a glass of wine.
Are you John?
I forbid smoking in my room.
I need to find out when Tom's going to leave.
She read the letter.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
He shot me.

You have to study hard.
Did you accept his invitation?
If you don't want to be alone, I can make you company.
I heard gunshots.
I didn't mean to put you in an uncomfortable position.
Who did you translate this for?

Are you done with breakfast?
I have some old computers.

You'd better not go.
I just haven't found it yet.
Let's go ask her.
We usually talk French.

Tom, I really hate him.
The problem was I had nothing to say to him.
I think Tom was really having fun.
I wouldn't do that.
Why don't you take your coat off?
Let's talk seriously about your future.
And I have a few calls to make.
Whatever happens, we'll make them talk.
Would you be so kind to close that window?

Put your dress on.
I bought a few books from the bookstore.
Be loved.
It was a terrible accident yesterday.
He answered the questions correctly.
Put on your tourist shoes and don't waste your time.

Laura may have been sick.
Tom knows what's really going on.

Look carefully at the map on the wall.

I think you'll find it very interesting.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
I haven't showered in three days.
I've lost shape.
Bring me a chair, please.
It wasn't a stupid idea.

I haven't spoken to Tom in three weeks.
Stop whining.
I know what Tom's doing here.
I know a man who speaks French well.
I think you were wrong.
He didn't mind standing up all night.

Nothing else worked.
I have to get dressed.
I don't think you understand the most important thing.
I haven't figured that out yet.
I need to talk to Tom.

I don't have much money.
She climbed up the stairs fast.
The house we used to live in has been knocked down.
I'm getting married next week.
The prices will continue to rise.
We're studying French together.
In high school, French was my favorite subject.
Would you call Tom?
No one knows if he loves her or not.
Take me off this side of the light, please.
I think Tom's hiding from Mary.
Oh, I was sick.
Show us.
Why aren't you laughing?
Have you ever congratulated PfirichbÃ¤umchen in German?

I heard Tom and Mary talk.
We met in London.
Do you have any wine?

Do both understand French?
Something was taken.
Green suits Alice.
Our garbage gathers three times a week.
They got the fox trapped.
You're early.
You love kids, don't you?
I felt isolated.
What do you want?
I'm sad.
They're late for the storm.
I guess it won't be a problem.
Talk slower, please.
"Where do you live?" "I live in Tokyo."
I'm busy right now.
I feel so bad.
We were soldiers.
Work is not just a need, but also a pleasure.
We need to be careful.
It's already 11.
I run every day.
I think that's Tom over there.
How was last weekend, Nancy?
Do you learn French?
I'll call you tomorrow morning.
I'm not reckless.
I have to report this.
I've never been so proud of Tom.
You need to use a disodorant.
When I get up, you're the world.
Actually, I'm not sure who Tom is.
There are some things I have to take care of.
I never doubt his honesty.
Don't look at me like that.
I won't be involved in this.
You don't look too surprised.
That's a warning we need to take seriously.
What does the fox say?
We'd like to eat.
Let's get a sack.
Tell me a joke.
Tom is trained to speak French at any time.
I've seen Tom do amazing things.
The apples are red.
You have nice hands.
People in general are against the war.
Your hair needs a haircut.
I'm better.
Tom hasn't met me before.
Can I see your driver's license?
This will never end.
Tom teaches me French twice a week.
Why don't you just tell us what's bothering you?
Maybe they have something.
I could make you happy.
What tooth hurts?
We're studying French.
What makes you think that?
You're sitting in my place.
We know who you are.
Do you like black cats?
We study French every day at school.
Do you believe in miracles?
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Tom seems lonely.
Let me tell you something about myself.
I haven't seen Tom since I was 13.
Her hobby is to collect postmarks.
I don't have anything.
Have you ever painted this house?
If we were expected to talk more than listen, we would have been given two mouths and one ear.
Don't play baseball here.
I got your coat.
We had a great time last night.
I'll drive to Detroit.
You won't believe how popular Tom has become.
Did you do it?
My father often takes me to baseball games.
Are you brothers?
I felt very uncomfortable because I didn't speak French.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Are you afraid of something?
He didn't know anything about him since he left for America.
I'm gonna have to deal with this now.
I put my hands in my pockets .
I would never hurt them.
What's your son's name?
I've never seen you so nervous.
He's become a great musician.
I'm counting on you.
Aren't you nervous?
Have you heard from your sister recently?
They're all hungry.
She went down the stairs.
I was alone, studying.
I didn't tell Tom.
I think you're still in love with Tom.
I think you better sit down.
Our sales are down.
I saw Bob this morning.
Get me something to eat.
If you haven't paid for disregard, please send the long amount and allow us to remove the problem immediately.
It smells like a toilet in here.
I'm here on vacation.
Looks like you're alone.
The question is being considered.
Tom was saved by a random passer.
The county is in the center of town.
They're not hungry.
Call me if you need me.
Let's change the subject.
The bar is full of people.
I'm terribly hungry.
It's very kind of you to step out of your way to help me.
Tom thought Mary's story was interesting.
How about we stop the car and get some rest?
Tom lives in the same part of the city Mary lives.
Now it's a little after eleven without a quarter.
Both pronouncements are correct.
I've never seen a blackout before.
We need to call the police.
I have information about Tom.
I'm sure this book has never been translated to French.
I'll see you again.
I'll try it again.
No one could sleep tonight.

He was going around the country.
The sum of all angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
I've been working with Tom for a long time.

I need to call Tom.
It's a little cold today.
I'll sue you.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Who let the dogs go?
I don't feel sick.
I can't even read French. I can't even speak French.
I'll do my best.
I'll go with Tom.
Mike's swimming very well.
Be careful!
I want a boat that will take me away from here.
Let's talk.
The diamonds are the best friends of the girl.
When he was young, his parents died, so his uncle raised him.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
I have to warn him.
Where's the station?
Don't throw anything away.
What's going on up there?
The dog couldn't bark.
Is it safe?
He sleeps like a baby.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
I'll follow your instructions.
I have a sharp knife.
You painted the walls, didn't you?
My mother teaches flowers.
What a wonderful time!
Don't waste your youth or you'll regret it later.
I think you'll find it interesting.
But isn't he above the law?
A modern factory is fully automated.
Don't let Tom scare you.
The adoption of English is difficult.
I think you should join us.
Can I open a can?
I didn't do it on purpose.
I haven't seen Tom lately.
I think Tom's leg's broken.
Tom told me he wanted to live on a lonely beach.
Why did Tom want to study French?
This is where Tom was born.
Where were you born?
I asked him to send us the book.
I have no idea how it works.
You're all fools.
They exchange gifts.
I personally don't mind.
Mr. Howt, the Japanese food started to like it.
I put the money in the safe.
We're in a hurry.
Tom heard something.
I hope that's enough.
You have to point to that fact.
This one's okay.
I was your mother's first boyfriend.
Tom teaches me to speak French.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
I think that's very unlikely.
I want to find my account.
I'm sure Tom knows enough French to get better.
I went swimming in the river.
Mary's Tom's older sister.
I don't know any of them, not the other guy.
The guests should start coming soon.
I'm crazy about football.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
It's been a great pleasure!
This isn't your house.
I didn't see anything.
Hey, I just got here.
I'm a hero.
Damn you!
Tom pushed Mary from the edge of the rock.
I hope Tom's right.
Aren't you happy?
Get ready for the worst.
The fruits rot under the sun.
He's always late for school.
Tom made some mistakes at the control.
Time is on my side.
Aren't you happy?
It could take some time.
I thought you might get out of the way.
Let me help you put your coat on.
Watch out, a car's coming!
She speaks three languages.
What do you think of this sweater?
Take him with you.
Now I remember, you shouldn't smoke in her car.
Nancy smiled happily.
He's only four minutes away from here with a train.
What's Tom trying to achieve?
Can anyone trust you?
It's a little fat.
I think we better go.
Tom said it probably won't take too long.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
Can you keep a secret?
Hey, guys, keep quiet!
I would never hurt them.
I've been studying French.
Can't you stay a little longer?
We stayed in Dorchester.
Are you depressed?
While we were on vacation, a neighbor took care of the cat.
Tom's both parents were teachers.
Kids have to listen to their parents.

I'm not that tired.
You have a wreath infection.
He started writing a novel.
He's satisfied with the result.
Hurry up and you can catch your train.
You won't need that anymore.
Put it back where you got it.
Let's get started.
I screwed you up.
Tom found out Mary was stealing money from the cash register.
Give me a drink, please.
Where was that?
I'm a little early.
We're not sure what happened.
I want something to eat.
So you did it anyway.
Can you do it yourself?
She's blushing.
Do you think I'm that stupid?
If you give someone $20 and never see it again, it's probably worth it.
That's Jane's bag.
Tom always smiles.
Tom doesn't believe in evolution.
Do you think Mary is attractive?
What's the minimum wage in India?
Don't make that decision today.
She didn't have much money.
You sat in my seat.
When did Tom die?
These two shirts are made of the same material.
Do you learn French?
You shouldn't give up English.
It was unfair.
You're wasting your time.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
What's Ken eating?
I went to the hospital.
He did it himself.
Next year we're going to college.
What do you eat, fish or meat?
I made a check account.
I thought Tom had a day off.
Why isn't Tom here?
What's Ken doing now?
There's a lot of DNA sentences, but there's not one for the RNK.
One of my parents has to go to the meeting.
Thank you for paying attention to this.
Don't mess with your nose.
The wind was blowing the porives.
I want something sweet.
I told Tom the truth.
Her big daughter is married.
Tom speaks French much better than any of his classmates.
From 20 students, only one reads the book.
I have a job on Wednesday.
Where's my grandfather?
The Japanese have the tendency to trust established authority.
I went home with the train.
I think I can do it on my own time.
Shall we go out?
They call me Bob.
In what situation would you do that?
What was the name of the guy you dated before Tom?
Try it again.
I'd like you to translate this letter to French.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
Tom's French is very good.
I'm not a philologist.
She lives in New York.
He must be the school manager.
I bet I'll get there before you do.
He was painted like a clown.
It's awkward in her presence.
She bought him a dog, but he had allergies to dogs and they had to give it to others.
I haven't told you yet, have I?
There was no TV or radio at the time.
She went to the cab museum.
Mind your own business!
He wrote a letter.
I can't agree with Tom.
These socks have holes on their heels.
Tom likes to knit.
You're a good doctor.
Don't ever say that word again.
I saw him stop.
She felt her knees shaking.
Edison invented the electric lamp.
Tom asked Mary if she could speak French.
I'll meet him some other time.
She wasn't that strong.
What a strong wind!
That's my CD, isn't it?
I told you not to look for me, Tom.
That's why we're here.
He's dating a group of kids he shouldn't.
It'll be fine if you don't get involved in personal matters.
Do you have to go to the mail?
My veins bleed every time I use a tooth thread.
We arrived quickly because the movement wasn't loaded.
You should be careful.
What do you miss?
He recently returned from France.
Molly's got a big watch.
Tom's not helping me.
I haven't been in a relationship with him in a long time.
Those glasses are good for you.
What'd you miss?
Tom opened the box and looked inside.
Don't eat until the clutch passes.
I would never lie to you.
Kate's watching a dog.
I don't know everything.
I'll never do that again.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
His friend is a former senator.
Is the French harder than the English?
I don't like this pair of shoes.
Are you afraid of anything?
I have two cousins.
The leaves fall in the fall in the fall.
Aren't you going to do anything?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate you.
We can't postpone the meeting.
How long has Toim been studying French?
He was completely exhausted.
Thank you for coming!
Hey, I'm a little sick.
I'm so ashamed.
There seems to be over two thousand sentences in jingursky in Tateeba!
Tom's stubborn.
We can't postpone the gathering.
I'm ashamed I did that.
Let's cut through here.
I know this is hard.
Are you an exchange student?
If you need help, ask.
You've always been a little weird.
You think you're going to Tokyo tomorrow?
I hope it's worth it.
Don't give Tom your number.
Is it true that Tom and Mary were arrested?
If humanity doesn't care about the environment, the environment will destroy mankind.
No, thanks, I'm just looking.
I felt like I was rejected among these people.
I think you'll have a good time tonight.
Don't take it back yet.
Sorry to interrupt.
Being too generous is his biggest flaw.
Press Shift button.
You understand, don't you?
Jane always acted like she was very rich.
Tom wasn't the youngest.
I think he's innocent.
Yeah, I know that.
I wonder what Tom meant.
It doesn't cost anything.
I don't mind the hot weather.
I think you need someone to talk to.
I want new cards.
I'm thirsty.
Flowers waved without water.
Do you know why I'm here?
Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't like him.
See, I told you Tom couldn't swim.
I forgot.
The bill, please.
Does the price include breakfast?
Guess what he told me.
Salt's over.
She forgot to feed her dog.
That's not the problem.
Go and welcome him, and in the meantime, let this letter go.
This chicken hasn't been wearing any eggs lately.
I hear Tom stole a car.
We weren't hungry.
The dolphins are very intelligent.
Did I disappoint you?
Wait for me to finish, please.
Tom couldn't help Mary.
He's very happy that his life in school is going well.
Mrs. Young wouldn't mind that I visited her unexpectedly.
You have nice lips.
A lot of people will lose their job because of the car industry's colliding.
He came to me for help.
We'll start the lowering in Honolulu.
I heard you were looking for me.
Our food is over.
The moment of glory for Hanshin didn't last long.
Is there a big house?
Wouldn't that lead to trouble?
He was disgusted that he was called a fool.
Their condition is getting worse.
Do you really want to?
Is he going to fail the test?
I can't understand why he didn't tell the truth.
I'm not a student.
What conclusions have they come to?
Here we are at last!
I'm taller than you.
I think I'm lucky.
Tom could have lied.
I feel good.
She pressed the button.
I didn't feel well, but I went to work.
Are you really happy?
I just haven't found it yet.
I have to move.
He's a famous composer.
Tom put a pie on the kitchen window to cool.
Happy is that man who married a good woman.
Tom gave me good advice.
He always tells the truth.
I can't live like this anymore.
Ah, what a pity!
Say hello to Jimmy.
Does it taste good?
Are you going?
I heard what happened.
Of course, she's right.
Don't force me to shoot you.
The equator divides Earth's ball to two hemispheres.
It was personal.
Doesn't it interest you?
It's a great pleasure for us to watch baseball games.
I think it's good for you to rest a little bit.
When did you start studying French?
She was working on her hair in front of the mirror.
I already did my job.
It wasn't easy.
Do you think it's gonna rain today?
You're very brave.
There's a bag on the desk.
Where did you throw them?
How's Tom going to handle the problem?
The thief got away with the money.
I haven't talked to you before, have I?
Tom was late for dinner.
This is the picture of my new house.
I want to sleep.
This camera's Tom's, right?
I sent her a doll.
I'm smarter than her.
My uncle gave me the watch.
Please excuse me for the delay.
I felt isolated.
I'm pretty busy.
They're pretty important.
Are you Japanese?
Nancy looks like my sister.
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I know a man who can speak French well.
Check that sweater.
I'd better stay home.
That's not very funny.
The phone is something you can't do without.
A few days ago, I contacted them, but I couldn't get an answer.
Why is your mouth open?
My dad drives very well.
We have to protect our children.
I'll see you guys later.
I'm completely exhausted.
I'm just looking at things realistic.
I heard you encourage them.
We know you're not stupid.
Tom didn't like his name.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
In the summer I plan to go to France.
Please mix the cards carefully.
Get on the bus for Christmas and get down to Zeestrase.
The laughter is useful to your health!
That's not a mistake.
I guess you're the Tom that everyone told me about.
Add this website to "Defaults".
When the sun of culture is low, even the dwarfs throw a great shadow.
When's the museum open?
I've seen you somewhere.
He sat on his bench.
We just cleaned up the toilets.
Tom and I have a meeting at the mall.
I'm not taking any threats.
You're in better shape than me.
Do you have a tickle?
I hope it's useful.
He tried it himself.
I'm from the FBI.
Tom works for me.
He stays up late.
Tom's fine.
I walk like a penguin.
Don't change the channel.
Watch your step.
Can I get your knife?
You have to file the report by the end of this week.
I haven't seen you in almost three years.
Are you armed?
I wish you'd told me that before.
Don't look in the camera.
It's raining, but we're gonna go anyway.
Tom and Mary didn't speak French.
I did it once.
He disobeyed my advice.
There were a lot of people on both sides of the street.
Don't make me regret this.
I thought Tom was gonna cry.
She's a friend of hers.
His clothes always smell.
I want to eat something.
You never mentioned how beautiful your sister is.
We're like brothers.
I can't even put the water down, let alone bake a turkey.
What's the name of this river?
Is she available to you tonight?
I thought Tom was in love with Mary.
The winter roads are covered in ice.
We're almost out of time for dinner.
I don't want to be your enemy.
I'm an adult now.
I want to go.
Bring her back!
I'm not telling you to go alone.
I want some orange juice.
I would never lie to you.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom left early.
Tom speaks French like a Frenchman.
I think we should agree.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I don't have a problem with that.
Where's the ticket register?
I'm really busy.
I think you should go home.
Give me your opinion, please.
I think you're gonna need this.
I hate flying.
What are the other options?
Get me something to drink.
Am I going to die?
I got a little tight when I danced, and I climbed the table.
I believe you.
How many brothers do you have?
I think you'll remember that.
Please turn this into pounds.
I think Tom lied to us.
I'd like Tom to smile more often.
I just want to sit on the beach and rest for a week.
I'm thirsty.
The bus was shaking on the messy road.
Tom has the right to know.
The wind of you.
She took her test.
I'm studying at the library tomorrow.
I told Tom the truth.
Can't you do that?
I've met him before.
Tom never gave up.
Tom's not in trouble.
I made a few mistakes in the test.
This book is not Tom's property.
Where was that?
I have to take it off.
Is there anything I can do to help Tom?
Take off your glasses.
You're wasting your time trying to convince him.
She wants to work at the hospital.
Tom's already a grown man.
Let's not fool ourselves.
I'm getting better.
It's not art, it's a tooth vagina.
I never saw you.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take one of these.
You're so responsive.
Have you heard of him?
She washed the shirt fast.
Is anyone with you?
The museum is open to visitors.
Tom really wants to win?
My grandfather likes to read.
Did you know you were wearing different socks?
He's making a copy.
What color is Tom's car?
You deserve to be happy, darling.
Tom had a one-only wish.
Please tell the truth.
Tom went out with Mary Friday night, with Alice Saturday night.
Looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom doesn't speak French as well as Mary.
You can't read French, can you?
That's exactly what I want.
Letter paper.
Some of Tom's students speak French very well.
I can't hear anything.
I'd better make sure.
I can't help you.
He came out under the car.
He writes to his mother from time to time.
Men get into shape driving a bike.
This isn't the end of the story yet.
Don't rush.
Tom took the wrong bus.
Let's get some rest under the tree.
You can improve your English if you want.
Get me a dry towel.
Jim's name is James.
Is there any other hotels you can recommend?
This bike belongs to me.
You're kidding!
It takes more research.
Are you sure Tom's alone?
You'll never be alone.
Is there a phrase like that in French?
Are you talking to me?
You're my best friend.
Anne's a little girl.
Just squeeze your thumbs.
I went to the park.
I like playing basketball.
The train arrived ten minutes late.
She lives in the deep province.
Excuse me.
I don't waste ammunition.
You're my best friend.
I was organizing a meeting.
I didn't tell anyone about us.
That was just stupid.
Are you sure?
Have you ever read any French poems?
Ken didn't run.
I paid the video for five contributions.
I just want to move with you.
She got twenty-one.
I heard it coming out.
My stomach hurts, Doctor.
You don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?
They come from Sweden.
Be careful when you cross a loaded street!
A man has to work.
That's intriguing.
What's your nationality?
That part's good.
Merry Christmas!
Come down.
Mary's running.
They long for the city's life.
I'm glad you made it.
The dog was walking around the table.
I'll be in my office.
I think we should call Tom.
It happened between eight and ten hours.
Tom wasn't fat.
We're all friends here.
Are you sure you don't want one?
Tom came in with a letter from Judy.
I heard Tom kissed Mary.
I think Tom turned himself in too easily.
I heard Tom and Mary discuss it.
Let's eat sushi.
Drop those socks, please.
Please be more careful in the future.
Tom was overwhelmed by a panic attack.
Can I open a can?
He was a baseball player.
Don't say that.
He came after you left.
Have you eaten breakfast?
The room is fully furnished.
I admire your courage.
I'll check upstairs.
Tom's traveling first-class.
Don't stay out too late.
I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
I didn't say that either.
It's better to give than take.
Can you take this, please?
Jane wrote the letter herself.
Can you resolve this task?
I think you've had enough.
You've told me that some other time.
It's been six years since I started learning English.
I can't buy you that dress.
I work like a bee.
Brian made Kate wait for him.
I forbid you to smoke.
I noticed Tom doesn't usually lock his door.
Could you help me translate this?
Tom doesn't know anything about French.
This is the same hospital Tom works.
Tom's not that smart.
Why do you want to become a nurse?
Carl seemed very happy.
Linda loves chocolate.
This air conditioner is wasting a lot of electricity.
Don't get attached to this hunting propaganda.
Tom thinks the death penalty should be cancelled.
First the good God made the man, and then made the woman. Then he mercyed the man, and gave him tobacco.
I forgot to lock the door.
Do you like it?
Boys, don't make any noise.
Don't look them in the eye.
I'll be back in an hour or there somewhere.
Does that look familiar to you?
Take your coat.
What money do you have?
That won't change anything.
The building's almost finished.
I thought they were unemployed.
I'd better get to work.
Aoi dances.
Today, machines can do a lot of things for people.
He went for a walk.
Please start now.
I've seen your driver's license.
Where's my room?
Tom's suffering from a flat rate.
Keep digging.
Where's the museum?
"The human nonsense is endless," I say, and because of this self-criticity, I'm considered an exception.
The storm didn't stop, on the contrary, it was getting stronger.
Tom made Mary translate the letter to French.
The unemployment is still high.
Tom assumed Mary wasn't coming to the party.
I wasn't talking about him.
Is that what Tom would want?
The whole road goes down the top.
Aren't you ashamed?
I think you should send Tom to Boston.
Ask Tom again.
I wish things were back the way they were.
Show me.
Tom got his tooth out last week.
The more you run, the more you get tired.
Don't cover how you feel about it.
Is there anything for me?
Can you open the door for me?
The girl's Irish.
It'll be a challenge.
I'm sure that won't be necessary.
Tom often hurts.
The key doesn't go in the lock.
What's the minimum wage in Italy?
Tom turned the lamp back on.
That bike's mine.
I'm not used to eating mad.
Pick what you like.
Go over there and talk to her.
We met at a summer camp.
Don't talk in the classroom.
That's not me.
When my father found out I was dating Nimrod Nick, he got very angry.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom died yesterday.
I thought we were gonna have breakfast together.
I think Tom forgot his camera.
I think you'll find out it's Tom's fault.
She put on a sweater.
Sometimes I run out of money.
Don't worry, Mr. President: with such bad wreaths, she hardly even has teeth.
I've never seen you here before.
I think Tom will die.
He lives in a cozy little house.
Go back to bed.
Why didn't you try the dress before you bought it?
Tom killed himself jumping out of a rock.
Where were you born?
These clothes look good to you.
They went straight to their goal.
The boy came through the window.
I haven't started anything yet.
The bill, please.
I thought you'd be happy.
Are you done with dinner?
I heard Tom gave you his grandfather's violin.
Do what you think is right.
Are you falling in love with Tom?
Persistence pays back.
They arrived separately.
Speaking French is fun.
Tom won't make it.
Prepare for the worst.
I believe the Earth is being watched by extraterrestrial intelligence.
Let's go to the beach.
I think there's been a mistake.
My father walks in the park.
You're not that old.
He gave each one of them a pencil.
Don't push me.
I think you should let go of your beard.
Do you like French?
Looks like we're being ignored.
What's going on here?
Are you sure you don't want another liquor?
Many people share my view on this.
The bluesuit's clean.
A little tea, please.
I have a stupid question.
He finished his big business at last.
I have to stay here.
He doesn't have to work.
You just missed the train, didn't you?
The child is not a court to be filled, but a fire to be burned.
I think you should see this.
Don't you speak French?
Sort the words in alphabetical order.
Tom can speak French much smoother than I am.
I'll hide in here.
She took care of her sick husband.
He played when he walked.
I saw the girl between the crowd.
I could make you happy.
I can't speak English, but let's not talk German.
I don't have insurance.
He graduated Yale with honours in 1921.
I think I have a way to save you some time.
My name is Roberto.
I opened the door and kept it open to Mary.
We make milk cheese and oil.
How many episodes of One Piece have you watched?
I didn't mean it.
I'm on vacation this week.
If a sick woman folds a thousand paper barrels, her desire will come true.
I'm surprised this building is still standing.
I don't owe you anything!
The bus driver didn't see the walker.
Why did you leave?
I want my shirt back.
I spent my vacation in Haconne.
Take a look at these papers.
I'd like to translate this into French.
He didn't say a word.
They drink tea in the living room.
Tom lights the engine.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Looks like he was a very good athlete.
Give me some milk, too.
You cook 300 grams of rice.
Isn't that enough for you?
By the way, have you been talking to him lately?
Your bike is better than mine.
I didn't give you permission to leave.
Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
Be careful.
How do I get to the airport?
Who pulled it out?
Money doesn't buy happiness.
We're boys.
Bad weather stopped us from leaving.
Now I'm studying French.
Because I didn't know where to get off, I asked the bus driver.
Did you get what I sent you?
I'm terribly busy.
How did you learn to speak French?
Be there tonight.
You got into a winning series.
I can't be mad at you about that.
The distribution of television has significantly deprived us of our reading time.
It'll take me forever to explain everything.
Don't look at my closet.
The new coronavirus is very infected.
Every time I look for you, you're gone.
You're going down to the next stop.
Wait a minute.
I'm off the record here.
Don't look directly at Tom.
Are you sure Tom won't be here by 2:30?
Tom taught me how to surf.
He doesn't believe in God.
All I want is a cup of coffee and a toast.
I have to fix this.
I made breakfast.
He follows English literature.
The knife is stupid.
She looked at me considerably.
It's forbidden to smoke in school buildings.
I'm really tired, and I want to go to bed early.
We love you more than anything.
Why did you come so early?
Some people can speak well, others are good listeners.
I didn't understand the last word.
No matter how rich she is, she's not happy.
Go and see for yourself.
Have you seen my glasses somewhere?
You can meet him.
Close your textbooks.
I heard someone was coming in.
Tom went his father's way.
I've never stolen anything in my life.
Tom turned to me in French.
He can speak Russian, too.
Japan has many distinctive features.
Do you believe there's a god?
I'm walking with the dog tonight.
What's your blood type?
Ten houses burned down.
I shouldn't have let you do it alone at all.
Convicted of death.
I've only waited five minutes.
Can you show me your photo album, please?
Tom's house burned down.
The greatest happiness in life is to love and be loved.
How much is your daughter weighing?
Tom shouldn't have done this.
I'm an atheist.
I never write the words "borsh" and "shchi" in German!
I went to the market.
Tom's got his knees cut.
I'll come with you back to the hotel.
Give me some milk, too.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Do you have your driver's license?
I don't need your help.
He's at the door.
My business is rebuilding.
The keys are on the table.
I'm on my way to the park.
He reported the police crash.
I can't see him.
Your parents speak French?
I'm afraid you can't talk about a promotion right now.
You've always been a little weird.
Aren't you afraid?
I didn't talk to anyone today except Tom.
I almost can't hear you.
You don't have to go out.
Can you turn the light off?
He drinks the average large amount of coffee.
I'm disappointed he's gone.
You're wearing socks upside down.
We just got word from Kansas about your brother.
I thought I could trust Tom.
I'm studying French.
Is this new model on the market?
Do you know Mr. Brown?
Don't expect everyone to like you.
What is this really about?
Take care of Tom.
We can't live with 150,000 yen a month.
Abort.
She got the ticket without giving anything.
A lot of people think retro cars are pretty expensive.
The BNP for the third quarter exceeded 1% of the previous quarter.
I'm sorry, I have to study.
I forgot to tell you what to bring.
Can you even see anything out there?
Everyone was at work.
I'm out of gas.
Let's ask him.
Where's your father?
I'll do it just like you told me to.
Which floor do you live on?
Tom was on my bus.
I waited a month.
I have to go meet Tom.
He was forced to sign the contract.
Not as much as the disease knocked him down as the lazy one.
Aren't you scared, Tom?
Allah is great!
I just feel terrible.
At the end of the movie, she's very different.
Are you sure you don't want to study at my house?
Go back to your bed.
Tom hasn't eaten yet, has he?
My dog is watching TV too.
Let's get to work.
Are you sure you don't want to come with me?
I'm not crazy.
He watches TV sometimes.
I have to respect Tom's wishes.
That's pretty extreme.
Hurry up, there's only 30 minutes left until the train leaves.
Participants are preparing for the final round of the race.
I have plans for Saturday night.
It's like I'm tired.
I hope we'll hear from each other soon.
Our coming here was a mistake.
Don't touch us so much.
It's her hobby to collect postmarks.
I don't understand German.
I think you'll like it there.
I'll be fine.
That's why Tom won't know anything.
Don't forget to bring yourself kitchen facilities like knives and cooking dishes.
We're here.
Where are you going?
We're going to the beach.
I promised myself I'd never do that again.
Jane runs to school sometimes.
I think you'll like that.
I could make you happy.
Every student has a locker.
Have you seen the coal?
Tom couldn't believe Mary really loved him.
I can't buy you that dress.
I think you panicked.
He went out for a walk.
I hope you're right.
Not less than 100 people attended the meeting.
I know you're right.
My holiday plans failed.
I haven't seen you in a few days.
He came to Tokyo and married her there.
I don't think so.
I lost track of time.
He thought this could be a trick.
He's the greatest poet.
What's your problem?
I'll see my grandmother at the hospital.
Hell is a place where it smells bad and nobody loves anyone.
Tom squeezed his knee.
Where's the bathroom?
I have to report this.
You're pretty good with French, aren't you?
He postponeed the party.
Marie said Tom was her cousin.
They caught five butterflies.
Do it for me.
"How you doing, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
What exactly happened to you?
Get the car in the garage.
Are you sure Tom knows what to do?
I saw his father fighting him.
Keep your room clean and cool.
I had a rough night.
She didn't like her husband.
I was studying his face for scars of exhaustion.

He's often late.
I wish I had a friend like you.
I speak French every day at work.
I don't believe in coincidences.
He's nice.
I'm still a little busy.
I just couldn't make Tom know.
He's one of my neighbors.
We're almost done.
I closed my door.
I could make you happy.
I've never seen anything like it before.
Open the bottle, please.
I'm smarter than you.
The latest new introductions in medicine are remarkable.
You have to control yourself.
I have no interest in doing this.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain.
Can you speak French?
They wrote it down as a lost one.

I wish I could sleep.
Be more specific.
I was a vacation.
No one's gonna know.
Tom goes out to drink every night.
The museum is closed today.
She gave me a shirt.
Tom didn't put his belt on.
Do you think you're funny?
That's what you decided.
Where's the library?
The boy put all his clothes in his purse.
Get me the magazines.
She tied him to the chair.
I'm young.
It's a big town.
He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone.
Have you owed it yet?
Will you teach me to speak French?
You're cruel.
Tom stays strong.
The problem seems much more complicated.
I'm drinking water.
Don't worry.
Tom hasn't been feeling well lately.
I have to tell you something first.
Coffee, please.
I'm a widow.
Did I have another choice?
He's alone.
In China, we put the family ahead first, then the name.
Give it to him.
The boy palely reminded his father of appearance.
He always manages to write to his mother at least once a week.
He looked me right in the eye.
Don't stop because of me.
How do you distinguish them?
Time is on our side.
Do you love your mother?
They've improved their results.
Don't touch them so much.
Where's the boss?
When can we say that a person has alcohol problems?
Will anyone have to meet me at the station?

Tom's the guy who gave me that bike.
We're not gonna roll under the pressure of a tyrant.
Tom is a complete mystery.

Everyone but me was invited.
I didn't say that either.
He loves geography and history.
Did you come here alone?
Do you have any subordinates who speak French?

I'm giving up.
My eyes are tired.

Do you have this shirt in black?
It wasn't a party.
Well, you ordered a new dress.
I've seen you on TV.
Meg talks too much.
I took off some of my stuff.

This sweater is worth over $50.
Just leave it with me.
I don't like doctors.
Tom refused to speak French.
Tom doesn't make Mary wait too long.
Tony didn't know their names.
This is for Tom.
This is where Tom was born.
My car's in the service.
I have an old bike.
Don't you speak English?
Tom won't let you pay.
Shake out your shirts before they get wet.
I'll be there.
Don't get up too fast.
Why do you know that?
You're a panda.
I just don't want to see you disappointed.
The investment brought him 6%.

I think we should go.
Unbutton your shirt, please.
I almost forgot about it.
Tom can't forget the first time he and Mary had a serious fight.
You're in danger here.
I'll say I did it.
I don't have anything.
If you need help, don't worry about looking for me.
We managed to get some foreign brands.
I laughed.
It's hard to explain.
We went to the Shinjuku Race.

The phone is a convenience.
Do you sell French newspapers?
Now it's your service.
I'll be away tomorrow.
I want something hot to drink.
Tom went there to study French.
I haven't said yes yet.
I was barely handling the lights.
Don't talk to me.
What did you do with your camera?
Tom's very modest.
Thank you for that.
But bala, Turkish panic, Gidi Vancho, our captain.
I'll contact you as soon as I can.
I want to go to the same school that Tom intends to take.
The condition of the wounded is improving.
We have a lot of lottery leaves.
We are firmly convinced that when I make up sentences, the author must avoid to submit to harmful habits in the use of too many unnecessary words that are actually absolutely unnecessary in the light of targeted meaning.
Tom didn't see you.
Tom said, "Move," make a way and sit down.
I forgot his name.
Is Bob right?
I need to know.
When's it over?
I get sick every time I see blood.
Don't!
I thought we could make it by 2:30.
Tom doesn't think Mary looks like her mother.
I've seen Tom do some pretty amazing things.
He couldn't pass the test.
Almost all students love English.
God knows what can happen in an hour!
I fell asleep reading a book.
She's late again.
He wasn't that strong.
I'm not a king.
They made their way through the crowd.
Bring him in.
I doubt Tom's staying.
It's too expensive!
Goodbye!
I think Tom wants to kill himself.
I don't want to sell my soul.
Tom, I have something to tell you.
Police searched the house and found two pounds of heroin.
What color is Tom's dog?
Is that close to your house?
Jane fills out one.
I could make you happy.
Why is your French so good?
The fools run where the angels are afraid to step.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
I've been in sports my whole life.
I'll eat here.
I love tennis.
Do you authorize me to come in?
Is it hard to learn French?
I've waited so long for it to happen.
Come on!
Do you know if Tom can speak French?
I'm very happy.
You don't have to say such things when there are kids around.
He's cold easy.
I want to improve my pronouncement in French.
You won't believe what I heard.
I'll study Tom.
The train is ten minutes late today.
There was silence.
Are you absolutely sure you want to do this?
She didn't like him.
You learn French, don't you?
I have to go to a date.
I hope we find Tom.
Although I know a little French, I think we should talk English.
She's getting better.
What are you doing this weekend?
Aren't you nervous?
I need to talk to Tom now.
The drawer doesn't open.
Try to calm down.
We need to conduct an inquiry on the date of the exam.
Maybe we're avoiding the obvious.
Everyone dies.
Tom's a monk.
I have faith in you.
I'll take your advice.
My computer stopped working a few days ago.
In Japan practically every family has a laundry.
We're moving to Boston next week.
The raven flew away.
Will you marry me?
Close your books.
What exactly do you do, what is the scope of the study, your main interest.
You're trembling.
I'm a little busy.
I thought I'd go say hello to Tom.
I think Tom may be drunk.
I had a lot of heads.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Mark Zuckerberg is an atheist, not a believer.
There's little chance I can't make it to the meeting.

Tom's okay, right?
She was staring at the paper for a while.
J.F. Kennedy was buried in the graveyards in Arlington.
I'm not giving up.
What do you care about?
I could make you happy.
Carlos climbed the mountain.
He added some sugar in the coffee.
Give me your shirt.
I don't take any meds.
You'll never be alone.
Does he have a big house?
I'm sorry, I don't have much time.
I couldn't understand his ideas.
He knows how to capture his audience.
He'll get to Hacodate tonight.
I'm not a tourist.
A man has to try.
Hello!
They eat apples.
I got her letter yesterday.
I've been very bumpy lately. My favorite football team is falling in the west.
It was easy for me to deal with sweet stories.
Tom didn't know what was wrong.
I know you're right.
I need to know what you saw that night.
I studied French for three years with a language carrier.
That's not my car.
If we don't leave soon, we won't get there until it's still light.
Tom's hurting himself.
His room is a mess.
They take part of their free time to take care of the sick.
Are you sure you don't want us to come with you?
I really don't think Tom is going to go.
Ask Tom.
Put the radio on.
I'll stay three days.
We've postponed the departure for tomorrow.
Nature doesn't know boundaries.
I'm very happy in Georgia.
I'm busy with things.
I hear you think I'm crazy.
I'm a musician.
I need to know what the truth is.
If John had come, I wouldn't have had to come.
You better wear a sweater under your jacket.
I thought you'd be tired.
I think you're an idiot.
How complicated is it?
I heard you laughing.
I completely wiped it out of my memory.
How can I leave?
You can't go to the museum.
He insisted on his own, even though I told him not to.
I didn't want to hurt Tom's feelings.
Tom's swimming real fast.
Add this site to "Defaults".
I have a lot to say about this.
I love my enemies.
I have no idea why.
That's your concern.
The worst part is, it wasn't always that way.
All the doctor's efforts were in vain and the man died soon.
I noticed you weren't at your house last night.
He's threatening us.
You want to buy that spoon.
He's an excellent brain surgeon.
I got cold last month.
He can speak French, too.
Are you coming?
Let's change the subject.
It was very interesting at school.
They set up the library with new books.
I couldn't speak French.
Can I leave now?
Whatever you say, I'm not giving up.
I've been taking my day in French for the last three years.
I'm much older than you.
He only eats fruit.
It wasn't that funny.
Or he, or I'm wrong.
You learn French, don't you?
The girl's used to playing alone.
I play in a group.
The birds were singing.
Tom's doing the job at 5:00.
Although Tom left home early today, he's late for work.
I'd rather not speak French.
It was scary, wasn't it?
He looks strong.
You're so good.
It'll come a time when she'll regret what she said.
Think about it, please.
The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
Did they get a bus to the museum?
Is he your teacher?
Be careful with him.
Be exact.
What else do you want me to read?
There's a golden rule: with the gold, he sets the rules.
The house is inhabited by ghosts.
Tom's going to town.
Everything that isn't forever is aged forever.
You're early again.
Tom married when he was 30.
I helped Tom do his homework.
Can I help you?
You don't always agree with your boss.
I bought it for $10.
You don't have to go.
Tom lives alone in a big house.
You ever go to the beach with Tom?
I care.
Have you ever heard Tom speak French?
It's a beautiful sunset, isn't it?
You really speak French pretty good.
Say hi to Jimmy.
I heard what you said.
Tom didn't try to hide the truth.
I think you should choose Tom.
Something's going on.
Am I clear?
Many parents worry that their children do not get the basic knowledge of the numbers.
I finished philosophy at my university.
Which beach do you like to go to?
You can always give part of the work of the junior employees.
Maybe that's the problem.
She's a very beautiful girl.
Tom can't do that.
Whatever you're doing, you can't let a man believe in something, even less yourself.
I don't feel very well.
The air conditioner's not working.
You're sitting in my seat.
Would something scare you?
Everyone agrees with you.
Tom encouraged me to learn French.
I want an MP3 player!
Where's Tom hiding?
I'm shaking when I think about it.
I paid $200 taxes.
I think you should check under the bed.
That won't happen again.
I did it for you.
Stop it or I'll let you know.
We need Tom's help.
She's an atheist.
There's nothing to worry about.
There's something I need to take care of.
I can't accept the invitation because I have another commitment.
When I first met Tom, he couldn't speak French.
I've seen Tom do the impossible.
What the hell is that?
Is there anything else I can help you with?
I have no intention of retreating this watch for a little while, and let's not even talk about splitting up with him.
He couldn't get the job.
I think you'll do great.
Tom wanted to leave, but Mary wanted to stay a little longer.
I think we have enough food.
I'll be on the next bus.
Mary made egg sandwiches.
What did you see?
In the summer, I bathe every morning.
Tie up your shirt.
Read it again.
If I were you, I wouldn't be so sure.
I think you're crazy.
Unfortunately, I didn't make it in time for his speech.
I prefer grapefruits than oranges.
This place is worth visiting at least once.
He kept reading the book.
Are you sure you don't want one?
I like that color.
Just take it.
Her sister flattened her shirt.
I've told you that before, haven't I?
Why do you keep saying there's enough time?
I'll visit you tomorrow.
I don't want your gold or your silver.
I forgot to close the door.
I'd like some orange juice.
From the moment I took your book until I left it, I've been overwhelmed by laughter and one day I'm gonna start reading it.
I tried to argue with Tom.
The fighter's tightened up for the round.
That's what I've seen.
The dolphin is a kind of mammal.
What color are these?
He shakes his son's shoulder.
Tom heard something and wondered what it might be.
Tom asked me to stay.
I don't want to be involved.
I don't take drugs.
I'm dying to see Paris.
At Mother's Day, I gave my mother 19 flowers.
I think you're absolutely right.
If peace cannot be maintained with honor, it ceases to be peace.
She arranged a room with beautiful furniture.
The digit calculators can be bought at the price of pair socks, and thousands of British children in school, not less than the pencil and the tire.
This is the hospital Tom was born in.
You don't have to wait here.
And Tom, and Mary covered their eyes.
That's my baby.
I'll give you all the information you need.
Stop whining.
You can't just walk and abuse people like that.
Don't open those windows.
I'm not insured.
I borrow money.
She's cooking for college.
I think you're really amazing.
Looks like everything Tom wants is money.
I'm not going with you.
For the cold weather, when you want to drink something hot, I recommend this type of thermos.
Tom's running around like a headless chicken.
Greece is an ancient country.
A few people have visited the meeting.
He put on his coat and left the house.
Tateeba's new site will use a home "hyper" database from a "built by the foundations" search engine, and will go to the tattoebux-OS server with a tatetellitic CPU that is made entirely by tateebius.
The old man stopped her.
She hated being called a coward.
I like it very much.
I never voted.
Where's the bathroom?
Just go to your room.
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I totally forgot.
She gave me a nice gift.
Are you coming?
Let's meet at 2:30.
The crown is the symbol of the kings.
I don't intend to apologize to Tom.
What do you do?
I read all Milton's work during my vacation.
What will you recommend me?
I'm sure Tom didn't even notice you were late.
I'll meet him at the bus stop.
Every student was asked about one question.
Are you sure you want me to sell it?
I'm really worried about your future.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I've never seen you around before.
It's very hot today.
Don't rush to protect me.
Who is the capital of Greece?
Tom can't speak French, Mary can't speak French either.
I met her for the first time in London.
Can Tom come in tomorrow?
Watch where you're going.
They described the girl as a little girl.
Tom's not used to city life.
Keep your promise.
I forgot about that.
I think you're putting too much sugar on.
Do you like Mexican food?
I'll take you home.
The man is the only animal who uses fire.
All the flowers in the garden were swollen.
They made us work all day.
We chose him as president.
No kidding?
I've seen these pictures.
If I hadn't noticed, I'd tell you.
What's the minimum salary in Luxembourg?
His fate is destined.
Are those candles?
If you have to choose between the piano and the violin, what would you choose?
The answer is true.
I think that's great.
Did he pass the test?
Don't miss the bus.
Be careful not to break Tom's heart.
We went there for a week.
So far, so good.
This kind is in danger.
I think you better go to bed.
I like you so much.
I called the bell.
Wolves move on packs.
Do you have medical insurance?
Look out, Tom!
The museum is closed on Sunday.
I've been teaching Russian for three years.
We're married to each other.
Tom won't back down.
It'll cost about 10,000 yen.
Tom speaks French as well as Mary speaks.
How hungry are you?
This guy's stable.
I almost won.
It wasn't my fault.
Did you cut the paper?
I don't care what happens.
I've seen you with Tom.
Tom's my friend.
You're up to this in the wrong way.
Something's going on.
Fill it up.
We have a little chance of success.
Let's go ask her.
I can only wonder if that's the same thing for everyone else.
Are you sure you want to throw it away?
Tom speaks French.
The situation has improved sensitively to what it was.
I played you.
His joke was great.
The police will investigate the crime.
The stories you will read in this book deal with some of the many problems young people face.
We finally saw each other. I've waited a long time for this moment.
Can you clarify a little bit more?
Am I wrong?
Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
I think we need to look into things.
So we all agree.
If time allows, I'll go to the museum.
That tie really looks good on you.
I think you're gonna be a great father.
There's no way you can contact him.
Never give up, never give up.
Would you show me that bag?
That's my computer.
Bern is the capital of Switzerland.
You won't believe me.
Can you come by 9:00?
Let's synchronize our watches.
I'm shopping every morning.
I wish I could speak French like you.
Please don't do this.
Is this a petty store?
I'm looking for a gift for my friend.
Even if I'd told you, Kel Faida.
That's the camera Tom made the pictures with.
Make sure you don't get lost.
I'm tired of changing my plans every time you think you want something else.
It looks like a man from a distance.
We worked hard to tie both ends.
Good morning.
John's grandmother died after a long illness.
I have to rest.
She said she wouldn't move an inch, no matter who tells her what.
I don't even know how old Tom is.
The defendant was given the right to appeal.
Let's not rush it.
My dad went fishing.
They didn't offer me anything to eat.
You don't have to make any quick conclusions.
Don't worry.
He gave up.
The wine is the milk of adults.
Tom opens the windows every morning as soon as he gets into his office.
I can't work with you if you don't trust me.
That was years ago.
I'm having nightmares.
When Tom woke up, he found out Mary was missing.
I've seen these pictures.
I'm as strong as you.
I've never been to Europe.
I'm unemployed.
Why don't we take a cab?
I hope I'm not late.
I went home with the train.
Why are you always so mean?
Ewy!
Is that why you didn't want to come with me?
Have you decided what you want to order?
I found the boy asleep deeply.
She used to call him that way.
Are we capable of this?
My sister's name is Patricia.
I should have opened my suitcase.
We were discussing whether to cancel the reservation.
The kids thought their parents were made of money.
The swimmers were froze by the cold.
It's authorized for dogs.
Kids are flowers in our lives.
I had to cancel the invitation because I was sick.
Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
They hated Tom.
Go ahead.
This is a challenge for me and I learn a lot.
Tom was tired.
I counted on her.
Don't look at Tom.
I have to pay for it.
I want to marry you.
Calm down.
That's one of the fish you caught Tom.
All right, let's go.
There's a car coming.
Looks like we'll make it in time.
Being a troll is art.
I ordered you a beer.
I haven't seen him in about three years.
Let's play baseball.
She's a bodybuilder.
The man eats bread.
He's flooding the river.
You don't remember, and I'll never forget.
I wonder why I'm so tired.
Please give my regards to your family.
When someone mediocre sent a message to a bottle, it was just a childish fantasy. When Christofor Columbus sent a message to a bottle, the fate of a whole country was placed on a map.
Are you sure you don't want to help me?
I'm sorry I made you so much trouble.
Kids play dodgeball.
It's snowing.
I want you to clean up your room.
I tried to act human.
What's the plan, Tom?
Thank you very much for your cooperation.
Let's not talk about it again.
Her condition continued to improve.
Tom really wants me to go to his party?
I'm not tired at all.
Most people think I'm crazy.
How many museums have you visited?
I waited as long as I could.
He broke into the room without taking off my coat.
I went shopping last Saturday.
It's June 18th, and Muriel's birthday.
The way he works doesn't show anything to boast with.
We don't see things as they are, we see things as we are.
She pushed the door a little bit.
Come when you're comfortable.
Alexander wrote a few sentences in Berber.
I think you're the only one who cares.
What exactly happened to you?
That's when I visited the museum for the first time.
Is she staying in a hotel?
I don't like that jacket.
Tom and Mary went down the stairs together.
You're early.
You want to leave at the last minute?
He's an atheist.
I thought you might be mad at me.
I give up.
I know her very well.
What's in the beach bag that's in your trunk of the car?
I don't trust women.
He's an atheist.
Drugs can ruin your life.
Don't go, Tom.
Dima slept with 25 men for one night and then killed them.
If that's true, I'm not.
I don't blame anyone.
I will never forget your goodness.
There's no toilet paper.
You're sitting in my seat.
I don't speak French as well as Tom.
She got good grades in English.
What do you want?
Three months before Tom finished college, he died.
I hope John comes.
I'll open the wine and let it breathe.
I'm getting better.
Your education is important.
Tom stole your bike.
I'd be happy if you could come with us.
It happens.
Did I say something wrong?
When you get to the light, turn right.
I think you've done this before.
Press presence inside is not allowed.
It wasn't selling.
Where's the bathroom?
Everyone was singing except me.
My uncle gave me a gift.
We got there before lunch.
Aren't you married?
He crossed the Pacific for thirty days.
