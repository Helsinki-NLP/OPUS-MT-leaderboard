It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
It'll take time.
Why don't you go after him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're getting cold.
I like walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean to him?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
How much is it worth?
Our water was tied up.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking forward and back.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom's not my dad.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was sealed.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it so far.
You made a good choice.
The nudes view the nakedness as normal.
We were sitting and waiting.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine, give it back.
The wolves stalking the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll be there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I like that tattoo so much.
Get a card for free.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's a childless man.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damage.
Nobody trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should've known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did what Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little rusty in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
Tomorrow we'll help them.
I would have said yes.
I am obliged to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out the gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go to a picnic with John.
Don't be rude with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be silly, we're not made of monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Who do you usually have lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It's been going on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too big for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
It sounds like Tom.
No one judges you.
Stop making Tom miserable.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two relatives?
He likes egg ham.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather take a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my account.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She has a nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report myself.
Do you buy one of these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
The act is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go back?
Tom and Mary were speaking in French.
He shaved himself.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose flows every time I'm cold.
We've met several times.
Nobody likes soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terribly in high school.
Tom wore a hat on which the price was still on.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what it said in the papers.
Tom said it was an emergency.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having some fun.
I wanted to call you back.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're men-eaters.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried her own way.
Run!
Is the delivery paid?
I want tails.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes are transporting malaria.
You've been postponing this for too long.
I don't understand.
That's sad.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
The paper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You've got one shot.
Macedonian has four verbal ways: pronounced, conditioned, commanded and foretold.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected its lines as a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right to me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember how I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What's the Japanese economy going to be next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a pamphlet.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
It's a big court.
It's a child's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom kicked me in the ass.
I was only gone for an hour.
I'd love to help.
Is that what Tom thinks it happened?
The show has to go on.
Make a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't attract attention.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who do you have on the list?
He's got a very big alibi.
Look in the mirror, bro.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for his birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Do you mind if I come with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom's spending a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One thing Tom complained about is food.
Make sure you don't get messed up in the mud bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through the tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are the meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today's the fatal day they'll try to escape.
Everybody's out of their minds.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's room is rotten.
No survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
“ It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. ”
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I glued his slap.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
It'll work.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly wretched to keep speeches because of the hard speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised to tell him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is defective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels were in vain trying to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then run away.
He licked himself.
When do you learn?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom's reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and ate by man - eaters.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get on it right away.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Let's take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the clamp.
I don't have plans for tomorrow.
Tom fell forward to listening.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
Don't be honest.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie it up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is stupid.
We bankrupted.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you have to renew your passport?
Mary has no courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's no dive height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We've discussed this.
Tom got the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
The power heater warms the ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to see us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the pellets.
Let's forget for now.
Because of his father’s sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data quickly.
You mustn't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll sum up the whole thing.
I don't know about that.
I couldn't stand it at first.
His sleeve's stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left but him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are sealed.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think she's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids cry again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was pretty.
Tom was brutally killed.
I have thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on planktons.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water got to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy guy.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts very much.
Invite them to join us.
Where am I supposed to park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom had a bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are ripping apart.
Tom got Mary to donate money.
I got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you cheated on her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel very good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multiphase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran through the down.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
This mustard is really hot.
We're advertising our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You were a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit my head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's almost gonna have to leave.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched his hands.
There's nothing you and I would do.
He says that the previous dentist told him he would remove his nichotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carito in the dust is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This was a bad night.
Tom was driving through town with a high brake without notice.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to turn Mary off the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom seems suspicious.
Keep that for yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not a employee.
My old English teacher is probably turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly and do not see their own behavior as unwanted.
He wears high heels to make it bigger.
Do you like bowling?
Excuse me, I think you've dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
May I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't shout.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What difference does it make?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom's made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
The day was so beautiful, we decided to hike.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used indefinite expressions.
Your bucket's inserting energy!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big football measure.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I fear the darkness.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works in NASA.
Tom writes skillfully.
Something very similar has happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They've got to drop the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as dishonorable.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes glowed with anger.
Why did you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom might have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom's the smartest man I've ever known.
"I like to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in the woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
Just me he wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask for help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible Tom could be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that kind of desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
He apologized.
I can't find the hotel's address.
Smoking means suicide.
The fortress, butterflies, and the peppers are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light a fire.
I wanted to bring this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took off his knee.
Where do the piñols come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of skin.
I have to rest.
Can I take a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom made the show, and the crowd applauded.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but it didn't work.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink gased drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You cook a turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going so whatever he wants to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking slaughtered.
I know how it sounds.
On Tom's appearance, he didn't mind sitting alone.
I already feel considerably better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to keep my mouth shut.
I'm swollen.
Tom arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
It's always bent with your English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought an everlasting bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare phenomenon.
Tom packed his bags.
What good does that make?
That's very useful.
Tom's vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're an unexpectedly pronounced word.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do his job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom smiling Mary.
That was the main idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have a big priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
Do you understand?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won't make it.
Tom cleared his room.
You know I would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never take the capitulation.
I hope you're ready for the challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I see this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care of yourself!
Linda had a nausea, and she suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of painful.
I'll do as I know and can.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fix everything.
Tom threw the arrow.
It's not corroborating.
It's not safe here.
To my great pity, Mary came to the party in a harsh dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything.
The worst kind of hangover is emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the satchel to collect the honey.
I have to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom had the eyes when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that riddle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his fingers on his feet.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so people eat them.
Could you pull this arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He's spending money is water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's end this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
It's a book weighing.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom's been lying to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel seem to be choking sounds very badly, and I hear him in the next room chewing gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk the market!
Try being optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you teasing me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels keep us safe and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy didn't help.
My grammar's weak.
Tom was available.
Tom's going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is Jave.
Who saw me.
Tom's approaching.
Tom's the real hero.
Where did you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary everything about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second he was trying to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopol since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're relatives.
It's my fault I didn't call you back.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washs his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's asleep tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood in front of her.
There's more exits.
Tom has always protected the children a lot.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was renovated.
He gave me six lane handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven't found time to write that report.
I can do it without that.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's dressing.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I really like walking by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom's blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We need to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Do you know how to rot?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my dream.
What about the sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the teams.
It was a terrible view.
Dan's knife was full of blood.
Who did you talk to Tom?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you so much, Tom.
We'll eat cherry from Italy this afternoon.
And Tom's from Boston.
Look out, it's a tough bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I was gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsocial.
It suits me tonight.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is a source of life.
The ceramids that fell off the roof broke apart.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the bathtub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have kicked us out.
Tom's not embarrassed.
I'm just finishing the report.
Come on, hurry up!
You'd better go.
Tom's got the way out.
I have two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan admitted to Linda he's a heavy drunk.
It's on Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom dropped his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't fight with me.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here for you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary screaming.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amebs are life-threatening.
If you do this to me, I'll cut your throat.
Does Tom die of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't mean Tom's dead.
Waves create the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French write their word about "bubamara".
The elevator can move twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Is that good for you?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into dice and fried.
Ask the expert face.
I love traveling.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom was having a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of nice.
Tom erased his forehead.
This book is not yet translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a lot of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're being bitten by a conscience, aren't you?
I wanted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take a handkerchief, your nose's leaking.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom reiterated the question.
They were originally farmers.
All you have to do is trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We set up a tent.
I didn't think it would rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing pajamas and bathrooms when I came in this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
In the middle of town, there's a fountain.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is precise and that its results are more reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree hampered the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
Mathematics is doing his best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's vain.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Get some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I'm not cursed by their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's making us work too much.
Slow down.
He wants every wedding to be the groom and every funeral of the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not suitable for the semi-stroke.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out the pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long do you need this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Put a lyke on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not write their happiness down.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm teaching him English.
Usually what causes pain?
We're addicted to work.
The box is made of potatoes.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom's evil.
Try not to pay attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
Sperm was barking; there was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very boring.
I vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to dance, too.
Tom was a piano professor.
Tom was one-legged.
Is Tom interested?
I got it right here.
I want to make a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how best it is.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work in the open if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's treasures.
That cake is calorie.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I'm blaming Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
They told me you knew how to do this.
You're experienced.
What is wrong with her?
It's not an ordinary pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not blue.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of the day.
Should we wait here?
You come out so naked you'll get cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Are they all busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All stores are closed.
You made white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom finished the bowls.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We're unnecessary drama.
We believe in God.
We have to take everything we need to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go alone.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom agree with the associates?
It smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you a little advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom's a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I forgave you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom myself.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow, I still can't believe it.
What's the shortcut?
Thanks again for coming.
They're cheating on us.
The wounded soldier barely walked.
The sun's just coming up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom often downloads movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
The light is rejected by water.
Tom sucks the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police put Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
You miss anything?
Sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We were going between the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun, Tom.
He's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was pouring his barrel with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gifts.
Tom was working.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She's got short hair.
The crowd smiled.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the bottom.
Should I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the more important capitals.
What's under the blanket?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's all drinking tours.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously out of his mind.
Tom approached them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
It can't be him.
Tom certainly didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her rank.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rough.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm carrying my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have any pen.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you embarrassed to speak that way?
They've come to the conclusion that the ship has sunk anyway.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
I'm hurting work.
The question is who's gonna do it.
I'll leave for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was wrong at all.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He walks to school.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very witty.
Now the question is what we have to do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
Finish in the fourth place of 56 runners.
Don't shout.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he was obsessed with a girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds very good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom pissed Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
He's knitting a wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I don't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never see you in that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are threatened.
Tom made a proposition.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned around to watch her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right now.
He's got a huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We heard carefully so we didn't miss any word.
I already have plans this weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're exaggerating.
Please let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better when he drinks a few beers.
You have merciful eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, he'll be fine... when the crop produces grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you?
You insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when does he have fireworks?
Maybe Tom's lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
I'm dropping my hair.
The big question no one found the answer, including me, despite 30 years of female soul research, is "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The peasants reap harvests.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the break-in?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
At every breakup, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan pictures.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a success criteria.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I have something to do with.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost in translation.
Tom didn't have anything else to say.
How can you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think she's hiding something?
I hope there's quite enough air here.
She married a zero of a man.
The wind's steady.
Nothing's changed.
You don't need to dress anything.
The old man entreated before death.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I hit him.
What would Tom ask for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I've got the potatoes.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google for her?
It's not a spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
Mystery solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's true to me.
Are you sure we shouldn't have an appointment first?
One who can hear butterflies laughing knows and how the clouds taste.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They drew a shrimp to see who goes first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got great work to do.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to eat like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be much more afraid.
Have you ever worked like a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like him at all.
I just finished my worktime.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have a flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, warm it in the microwave oven.
The stream is on the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible Tom saw him.
Tom's knocking a little bit.
Tom's very immature.
What are they up to?
How is the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drinking.
I've been enjoyed by your company.
Tom, you need to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stabbed a fork in the booker.
Am I going to be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom's got a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
The whales are kind of mammals.
Dan waved Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make things easier for us.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not repaid.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
Throw your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's what I'm good at.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a bunch of questions.
Who runs things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every people have their own tongue.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
How did it come -- that's how it went.
His legs were smashed.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any new accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on the map?
Tom's unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the hover.
Look forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Does Tom bother you?
This is my latest look.
I haven't been feeling well for two days.
The intestines are waste.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between mule and donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Wandering this rain doesn't come into consideration.
I'll tell them to leave right now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got an asal.
There was no living soul in town.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a long time.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was firing Mary with a shitty egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom got worried right away.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I already believe.
She writes a letter to her mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy was impossible to swim the river.
Tom was here early than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old housekeeper has a certain charm.
This theme is taboo.
We barely saved each other.
Did they hire you?
Gas leaks.
Tom could see Mary texting.
You'll be better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most believe that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Dude, you can't just approach a woman and crush her -- it's counted as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting.
You can't do what you can.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He's been blowing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's going on here.
It is better to be optimistic and deceiving than being pessimistic and right.
The water was soft.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The body of the ship is divided into several waterproof parts.
Given what you cooked, I'll wash the dishes.
Let's leave this topic.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your condition.
He's got fake blinks.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knocking?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?"
He's not as shy as he was anymore.
You get that?
Don't do the scene now.
What was told Tom?
We can help you find them.
I need to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys everywhere divided into groups, some played mosquitoes, some tiles, some with ball, others riding a wheel or riding wooden horses.
Suspects destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk in the bottle yet.
We should both go.
The pain that causes love is sweet of any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from the inside.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He hit his head.
We're out.
Return the seat.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting mad.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
Today's less wet than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't determine who loves the baby because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix the bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
Are you lunchy?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a shoe on one side.
Let's eat something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm good at it.
She can't even read or write.
Tom hurt your leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom gets out of jail once or twice.
The most expensive thing is the country.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we have to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We don't have any food.
Is it Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you opposing?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Consider how much money we'll need next year.
I burned the matches in the dark.
How much does she cost there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you getting up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom's spending too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was burning my lungs, I was just chatting in my room waiting for me to recover.
Don't thank me now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, yeah.
There's no one here.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
You did your best.
He's a lubricant.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mom buys me a toy.
I won't take that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a runner.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them you'd give them right away.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What'd you do?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask for help.
Maybe you should call them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What do I have to do?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
We were 18 at the time.
I make thirteen dollars an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate carphyol.
I feel like seeing him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Keep it up.
This is disgusting.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
You've been drunk.
Tom started complaining.
I think you should pick her.
Rest assured.
You're gorgeous.
Tom lost himself in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Draw out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom cruelly looked at Mary.
Tom was wearing a sweatshirt.
Tom looks decisive.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
It's been a lot worse.
Tom's trying to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
I just drank a glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom's my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with a full mouth.
They're all out of control.
Every customer has rights.
I'm only calling to hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What were you doing last?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you a friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I'm going shopping because the car's broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
He's got us all enslaved.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not much of a big deal.
It was midnight.
That's scandalous.
What happens if you wet?
Have you changed the shampoo?
Tom looked around, didn't expect anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
You can take off your coat.
I don't think they were following me.
They don't have defense.
He often helps others.
Tom's a big pessimist.
You're entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually much more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to dip myself.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine a party like that, but as you like.
Do you think Tom would want to come with us?
Yoga originates from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom mashed his toast with butter.
We've got work to do.
I heard him sniffing.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
The sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the hill.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never meant to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's almost Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to problems like this.
You'll be all right.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the musama.
It rarely went there.
Tom's stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the defeated are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
The translation of jokes is quite difficult, if you can even say it's possible.
This was an arena day.
I'm bringing bad news.
This isn't helping.
Override the weakness.
How many pushes do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you have a key by chance?
Let's be realistic.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was crawling at alcohol.
Tom's getting fat.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a tiny set.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
You won the first place in the game.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often takes a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You're being disgusted.
Everyone's shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
What's wrong?
You gave up the plan.
It's not just speculation.
How do we find them?
It might seem weird.
No one can be saved from death.
That won't help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that what we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom's got an ear pain.
Dan got hit on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time now.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on your mind, Tom?
Mother's council would have outgrown the friendly.
We haven't saved ourselves from the danger yet.
Tom's freaking out.
He's been waiting ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan's looking for the police now.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.

What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm gonna get stronger.

Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.

She's got a picture.
He's skilled.
Flowers are wreathing.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is so annoying.
We need more American sleng of Tateba, urgently!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared and quit.
Is this place free?
Take a look at this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
I wouldn't want to get into it anyway.
Doesn't anybody want to sit with you?
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom said Mary was doing a bad thing.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying from school.
I often listened to him playing the trumpet tune.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's fooling.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the refrigerator.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee than tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
The mosquitoes enjoy human society.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom set the curtain on fire, by chance.
Did you talk to Tom?
It is hard to understand self - injury if you have never felt the need to practice it.
This is gonna hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately responded to Mary’s question
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in eating?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom's salting his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's so mean.
In what situation would you use it?
Can't we start over?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without someone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's weapon.
Look back.
Tom hasn't returned in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you have any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without interruption.
I got quality.
Did anyone find out how to watch the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom chuckled out loud.
Does it matter which one of these I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not gonna say anything.
It would be good.
We're walking fast.
Tom's very fried.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan dragged Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's already 11:00.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom, think about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom made for me.
I've seen him personally.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not doing what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems pissed off.
What the hell do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no replacement.
Hypochondric invents diseases where they are not.

Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my hand lamp.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be in school.
I never say anything, even though it pisses me off.
You're under his level.
It's like I'm getting early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible Tom could hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom's very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, vet the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to accept the job.
How many percent of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think I am.
That's very smart.
Please help me meet Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't last longer than five minutes.
If the time was running, the radioactivity was down.
Should we believe that?
What are you doing here?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for the computer.
You're a faggot.
What are you up to?
Why are you mean to me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody's done anything else.
I'm sorry to break in like this.
These books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom erased the containers.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a good point.
They must be worried.
I gave him a ride.
That gave me an idea.
The fed from the watch broke.
I asked about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Let's all follow me.
This is a good parking spot.
I've been going to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
It's his business.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to watch the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be okay.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's have a dream.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
It is possible that there is another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear's green.
Tom repented what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom murmured.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's in consciousness.
Tom scratched her hair.
Everyone's sitting down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
Looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
Let's start.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What kind of hobby do you have?
So I'm serious.
Forbidden talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a thank-you letter to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light's faded.
Come on!
And if he refuses, Tom?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to eat breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the light.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's very close.
We were worried about you.
The experience is not inherited - everyone gains his own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
This twain is stretched a lot when it's washed.
Truth is a purpose, not a destination.
I'm blaming him.
Have you heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I ran out of class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it's gonna be hard for me to hunt fish.
Tom was sleeping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs two helps.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were as black and deep as the abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him with the kids a little bit more.
Everyone has drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strong critic.
I healed my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold time.
That's not necessary.
I just wanted the situation cleared up.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll call you back.
It doesn't come this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom drifted.
Please repeat it.
You're very dramatic.
Tom's licking.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say Maria Antoineta was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's great.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We've been trying.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You have too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was voted as mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the crime scene.
I asked the same question.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would love that.
She ran out half naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's spinning.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this alone.
They drilled the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Do you know for sure this isn't a diamond?
You let Tom get away.
What is the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
April's weather is unnecessary.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was a boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm indispensable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut off the sandwich.
Can we see each other later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two kids.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left no food on the dish.
Tom has changed the direction.
There's no man alive in the classroom.
The rocket's flying.
We laughed.
Tom was a little sloppy.
Tom's only visiting.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom tried to make him look busy so that Mary would not ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
Flowers swell fast after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do it for them.
Tom's not writing well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Additionally, I can fly.
We wasted our money.
There was hate among them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never been a lamb to be anything other than who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to determine if Tom's happy or not.
This isn't hot.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you have a wish?
Children sometimes fear the darkness.
Stay away.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked for Mary's money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna catch you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's getting sad.
Cube's hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's who I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them licking.
Too bad I didn't ride a wheel here.
I need to see Tom.
What are you uncomfortable about?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I'm not wearing provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
I'll be damned!
You'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you're smothered.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What'd you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to shadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't give us a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He's a sex car dealer.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's overnumbered.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice in the footage doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get nasty.
I didn't know whether to get mad or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at 7:00.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is if he's coming to visit us next month.
The marionets are running wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you are.
The other girls were messing with her because of her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he had to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
Failure depressed him.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
She doesn't even understand me.
Bees believe that genetically modified plants harm bees of health.
You can go now.
They're stalling.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
Tourists were unhappy.
Tom's rooming the socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like spiders - hunting flies, but they let the axes and the Stršleds break.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left the key on his desk, just like he used to.
He took off his fur jacket down, climbed up, and softly knocked on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same thing on this subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Tom had something to do with it.
You want your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fine.
We were looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Are you staying long, Tom?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He escaped the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to do that again?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom's unforgettable.
Which is an extremely beautiful city.
This handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I write my legacy.
"Why did you break my vase?"
We were so close.
I'm sweating every day.
Give me your knife.
No one defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
There's a big day ahead of us tomorrow.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me breathe.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
He's watching TV now.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can tie me up, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try this sweater.
The cat put his claws in my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "Four o'clock." "What did you do so late?" "I spoke on the phone with my ex."
How did you get them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
His heart was broken by unresponsive love.
When's too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're upsetting me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a professional carpenter.
Tom's not as naive as many people think.
I hit his jaw.
We have two daughters and a son.
I'm going to lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone turned Tom down.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can get you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
What can I choose?
We have to put them in bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
I brought some bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why does Tom do that?
I have an assignment for you.
How does a number of names be formed?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got caught up with a nasty cold of him.
It's getting better.
This world is the valley of tears.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
He's not even mad.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom's got to get a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're really good.
That was a trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where'd this come from?
We're not done.
Tom was put in prison for spying.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only with a shell.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not keeping my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He would do anything to make money.
Now I recognize you.
I don't want you to say anything you don't think.
It's a beautiful room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'll go see Tom and see how he is.
Let Tom make his cupcake.
Our chun was getting closer to the little island.
You won't win.
Wait a minute. My laundry's ready. I'm going to give it to you.
Tom was a miner.
It's totally white.
I wish I had enough will to hold a diet.
The man at the moment is in America.
He's believed to be guilty.
I'll look at Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I'm here for the first time.
That trumpet sounds so bad to me.
I'm tired of my eyes.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
A boy grabbed my bag while he was passing by with a wheel.
When was the last time you fed the baby?
My muscles hurt a little bit.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm crawling.
They're gonna fire me because I'm really late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a few earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's it!
There's always a trick.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Ghost, are you there?
There are no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old, historical building.
I can't ask him to do that.
They're really ugly.
Tom's back covered in mud.
That's not for you.
Tom was wondering if Mary knew what was wrong.
I have nothing else.
Tom's in a pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with kids.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom booked the seat.
I want to use this.
What color was Tom's socks?
Tom baked me a cake.
I've never been a jury before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like being touched.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were nabbed.
Traveling abroad doesn't come considerably.
Tom ended up a winner.
Tom came right away.
I came to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.
I came home and told my wife about the work in Boston.
Tom took off his clothes and went to bed.
And the opposite is true.
Tom's very naive.
Tom didn't want to leave so early.
I'll explain later.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I'm chewing gum.
The girl who plays piano is my little sister.
I'm not sure anymore.
Don't lose hope.
Have you been there?
She's wearing hulahops.
They don't miss stones.
Tom left on the wheel.
He came back at 6:00.
It has been proven that the bulls living on dogs jump higher than those living on cats.
Watch your step up the ladder.
Were you with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this from?
Butler opened the door.
Tom was wrong anyway.
Get your paws off me.
Don't say that name around me.
Will you throw that away?
Tom has a good profession.
They're my stuff.
Tom used to take a walk every day.
The same thing happened to my friend.
I don't feel that way for you anymore.
Tom's not stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We'll handle this.
It feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'll reread this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom has suffered a catastrophic failure.
He just came back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you get to Boston?
I've been bitten by something.
The mushrooms contain significant amounts of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom's back at work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid to face mistakes than to make mistakes.
This is an immense stupid question, but who's stronger, the lion or the tiger?
We'll have company.
We're classmates.
Tom took the tube out of the champagne.
There's a girl missing.
Tom despises your brazenness.
Don't eat live pork.
Tom made a list of places he wants to visit.
From his views, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me red and white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
He shot three times.
I'll complain if I want to.
They're gratis.
Will you come back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in a choir.
I don't have a word to say anymore.
You can make it easy for yourself.
You know, my dick.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
Give me a few minutes.
You know how to recognize children's voices without trouble.
I suggest we go home.
Tom refused to talk to me.
Tom doesn't like me.
Do you know Tom by chance?
Tom wasn't sure if he liked the plan.
Tom's very young.
Tom's so stupid.
Tom wants to see him.
Tom was just partly joking.
I'll find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.
I can make a call.
Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid being captured.
Did you find her yet?
Tom's alone there.
You did your job well.
Don't be gay.
Freedom of speech is limited to certain countries.
Tom picked up his hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom's right.
Could you recommend a good book for me?
I'll take you home.
Does his stomach hurt?
Is Tom dead?
You're not kidding me.
Try to clean yourself up.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
They knocked next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
Don't wait now.
Has anyone seen Tom?
I could use some help with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
It was an amazing evening.
The smells of jasmine and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seemed bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very sharp tip.
Get ready.
Put it down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you or burn and if you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your watch.
Now you're in charge.
Not all of them sleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my pencils.
Aren't you going to leave?
Do you know anyone who could help?
This week is extremely warm.
No one wanted to get out of the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom came by earlier.
He's a fool.
Maybe you can help them.
The hearts of the broken mirror were scattered on the floor.
I can't ask him that.
He eats pork creams.
I have to go help them.
Tom's not daring to tell Mrs. White the truth.
Esperanto is acute language.
The garlic drops a strong smell.
I want to get some more sleep.
The tower is viewed from here.
They're on their own.
They're harassing me.
Tom was waiting in line.
Tom knew exactly where he was going.
I'm sorry I lied to you before.
I've got a few minutes off.
I'm sorry, but that's not what I'm up to right now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I like vanilla ice cream so much.
I just had breakfast.
Step by step, he's coming down the stairs.
That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
Should we call him?
My sister got more gifts for Christmas than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's with languages and doesn't taste good?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped yelling.
Were there any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom's warm.
Where's the bathroom?
Tom seems to know everything.
She gave birth to twins.
My boyfriend's a reporter.
What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would resist.
What brand of shampoo do you use?
It's good for playing cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you should handle this on your own.
As far as I can tell, Tom's got nothing from a medical point of view.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
Tom seems confidential.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?
Does Tom have a tail?
I thought you'd live with us.
How do I know how to get back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Eating can be spicy without being angry.
Bring her home.
I'd help if I could.
Whoever loves flowers can't be a bad man.
Get your computer.
What's this key from?
Tom should thank you.
I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what to do.
I wish I hadn't married Tom.
I know what this is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you pass me the remote control?
I'll get him to cut your lawn.
You help her once.
We cried in a duet.
I'll set up the table.
I have a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
There shouldn't be any problems.
It's hard to imagine.
Where's the nearest DJ store?
Where did you and Tom go?
Does anyone here know Tom's phone number?
I don't know what I got.
I haven't fixed it yet.
I don't work for him.
I can't wait to go home.
Tom killed himself on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.
The concert piano doesn't have any faggots at all.
I'll keep you a seat.
We were all shocked.
I'm not responding well to threats.
Take a breath and keep it.
I love Boston so much.
I know a city whose residents never smoked.
I must have forgotten.
Tom got Mary to go to the party with him.
Tom can do almost everything.
We arrested him.
What else could you do?
Please sign here.
I'll see if he's in there.
It'll be beastly.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not very normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?
Tom doesn't seem to speak French.
The fruit contains seeds.
You're doing a good job.
I don't have enough time to do anything to do.
The forest is my home.
There's a swelling on the head.
Vampires can't cross the threshold to a certain house without being invited.
I think Tom's got a lot on his mind.
I need peace and quiet after the hard day of work.
If you ignore the past, you endanger the future.
The windows in my room are cracked.
Do you hate him that much?
I want justice.
Why don't we go pick them up?
Please find her.
Tom doesn't stand Mary.
I'm not ready yet.
This bird can't fly.
I'm not a trucker.
Tom's studying law school.
Tom likes his job.
I'm an astronomer.
I had to lie again.
What are your plans?
Tom's a lucky man.
We're not invited.
Paravan shared the room in two parts.

Defend yourself.
Can we get him to fix it?
You have beautiful lips.
The earrings are a contagious disease.
Tom was hanging out in Boston a year ago.
I just saw him.
What's gonna happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.
I got out of the house at seven.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind has changed its direction.
Please don't ask her.
I have to take them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you came?
I can't get an asal answer from Tom.
I wish I'd known this sooner.
Is there something missing?
I didn't do it for him.
She felt quite lonely.
I'm going hunting on my own time.
Where did my chauffeur go?
He's in a flaw.
The coat is fur-coated.
Tom's ugly.
When did you buy that with Tom?
I've been briefed.
He slept hard.
I never doubted that.
Pignons are made in bottles.
Tom doesn't feel that way.
Tom was sitting on the stairs talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you had to eat.
I always like to eat.
Tom gave Mary the message from John.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
May I ask a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not some big sailor.
My father got a burn on the white cracks last month.
What a sad story!
Make sure you get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'm gonna live much longer.
You need to help her.
They're worried about him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom plays in a band and he's very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom's out of interest.
Let's play volleyball.
It was fun yesterday.
Tom might help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating at restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay, he's married and he's got three kids.
That was a secret, wasn't it?
I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medallions.
My dream came true.
This is a wooden table.
The situation is tense.
I'm interested in Greek mythology, too.
The Observatory has a good location.
I'm in charge of propaganda.
We have to put him in bed.
Tom had respect for Mary.
Tom and Mary haven't heard from John in a long time.
You're not dressed.
They're pretty good.
Did you confess to that?
Tom's a diabetic.
Call him whatever you want.
I'll send Tom to take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar to me.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They were verbally harassed.
Why were you chasing me?
I've been pretty busy.
I couldn't do what you were doing.
Are you always busy?
Tom heard the noise.
You're under her level.
Wisdom is a curse when it does not help the one who possesses it.
What is the origin of the universe?
Whoever calls, tell him I'm out.
I convinced Tom he should go to Boston with Mary.
Sheep feeds on grass.
Tom's gonna give up.
I didn't know you were unhappy here.
Tom gave up the thought of going to Boston.
I didn't find anything wrong.
Tom seems to be effective.
I need to be alone.
I can take it from them.
I read Tom's story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he was leaving at 2:30.
I'll take him.
It's not about luck.
I think you know the rules.
I truly regret that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at 6:00.
Let these people go.
Tom's eye didn't blink.
You're a good son.
I'll arrange for you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
Lamia saw her.
I need to turn off the phone.
Time's good.
This was the wrong information.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan saw him talking to an unknown man near the restaurant.
Tom with easiness did it.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a cherry outside my house.
He's the company's boss.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
It won't get any better.
He's already done his job.
My ears are shut.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to push myself.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at two and a half.
How could Tom know?
She's a deaf school.
You have a habit I don't like.
You sound very sure.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I took so long.
I don't want to wait.
What's that, invisible?
Radio's off.
I turned Tom down.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money at the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me and a point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let us do our best.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible that Tom doesn't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I got here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
It's a blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Envy is sin.
All children are foreigners.
They shot me.
Tom's not inclined to drama.
I finished twenty-five projects in just a month.
Tom couldn't take a look through the lock.
This tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That column isn't exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They talked quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going and a point.
So, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
Now you can't help us.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging your wells.
I have a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you anyway.
You cook nicely.
There's no short way to the top, just the break-in.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom pays a lot.
It was sad.
You can see you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked them all.
Automatic cars are now spread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom's wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new money.
I kicked Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my snack?
The organiser was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
His aunt eats apple or banana?
You're a moron.
She was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a prick.
I like the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't sweeten my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with that, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play the gaide?
They picked her up nicely.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine anyway I don't like it.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure I spent the night with a smart, ghost and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl escaped from home and got rid of parental control.
Tom's a rascal.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
The census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were gonna text me in the evening, but you lied to me, obviously.
Conjecture.
It's dissolved to take a bath.
The river from the sweat began to pour on my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nychilist.
Let's just drop it.
I like math.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you guys get around?
The movies are great entertainment.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests to expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged it.
I appreciate your help with this.
They were all smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight because of unfavorable weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
The singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They could be back.
I'm so scared!
The entire board is against it.
The world lights the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom made everything a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport is in the vicinity.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
It's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to keep an eye on Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom's soft.
I gave her a fake address.
I've got a room.
I'm not mad anymore.
It's a big chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you're panicking.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom's giggling.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'll really try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
He looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom's gone without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's an irrelevant mistake.
I really hope so.
Take your clothes off.
I have a lot of problems right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom's got anger issues.
Get him.
You're paying me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is, can it or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you gonna eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls lower than you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom almost hit Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He made a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him back.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What makes you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd you get involved, Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
The Germans have a light attitude toward nakedness.
We can’t help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they put his body in a large grave.
Women love mustache men.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Are you taking a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud lightning.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I had no luck.
His body was grown with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants on the island are friendly.
Why don't Tom and I try first?
I've always liked mysterious characters more.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most famous American poets.
Couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom will never come back here again.
No one likes cries.
She was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb the far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do that if I could.
Tom's really crazy.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We got there first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd love to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate very nice food.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
They beat me up.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought stinking trash bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He used to working in the garden after two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's out of his passport.
You deserve a medal.
They're very strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
That's a good memory.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom's still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is drugs.
This is a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look at the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
It was very helpful to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked each other.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was roasting brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never look for my wrists.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go into my room.
We just started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the mail with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I have some doughnuts.
I'm studying French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's wit.
We have to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You're not gonna need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientel consists mostly of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why do you have a problem with that?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love mustache men.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname fits him perfectly.
Can you make that stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You took out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom hated to go.
Tom seems a little depressed this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that topic with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took out his hat and bowed politely.
That's one reason.
Give me my book back.
Marco thinks he's skilled.
Tom looked.
My ears are shouting.
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very arranged.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a scumbag!
Who's making breakfast for him?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complicated.
Tom wouldn't back down.
Tom was suspended.
They're getting smashed.
She's going to be a teacher.
I don't intend to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks smashed.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're bumping.
He works at the embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this yourself.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's pissed off.
It's work.
We'll manage.
Praises encourage students to work hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop spending my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two people.
Tom's measured on a scale.
Something must've happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom got his nose up.
Tom looks a little shaken.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At the time, the title “lady ” was used only for noble women.
Tom's been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can a man choose only one?
I came to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I came to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched on the bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in the heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
Couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She slipped the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your childish laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I have something to do.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in quarrels.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thundershooting?
Stay out of work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
You put the king's crown on his head.
Tom kept his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're all right.
Your patent's unbuttoned.
This is one of mine.
Nothing stops us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned the fan on and pointed it towards the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked for Mary’s help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a strong headache.
Once he looked at him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank borrowed a million dollars to the company.
I've got a lot more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the conditions?
Are you staying, Tom?
I know what matters to you and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it easy.
My son always interrupts me when I talk.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
I guess I drank too much yesterday.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he didn't remember his name.
I'll get to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Can you lend me an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
He skew a sword from the steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will we see each other?
I promise you I won't do anything that will hurt you.
Tom's a single man.
The woman calls him the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did he want to see, Tom?
I'm so scared.
Day's furious.
I don't even know what's which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their point?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me in front of the mail.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my hand.
I'd better call him again.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't fuck with Tom.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Clean your eyes.
Tom just got in there.
I got a blood bowl in my eye.
That's where she visited Mary yesterday.
You're overreacting!
He's got a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch that the show is going to drop; they didn't sell a lot of cards.
Tom's going.
Tom doesn't think he's supposed to use a desodorance.
Does Tom swim a lot?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't force the kid to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
It's my job to read books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting dumb.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own flaws.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What are you looking at?
I have the impression it's raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come with a car.
I am grateful to you.
You've already caught a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one case less than me, she complained she had too much to wear.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live at all?
Mary's a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with a light on.
There's too much acid in this orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he'd pour the garden.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please do not add comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Thunders usually accompany thunderstorms.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I got a little fever.
Tom knocked him on the ground.
This lecture doesn't end!
The glasses are in the cupboard.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to hang out with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear your helmet while you're driving the engine.
We're worried about him.
Tom's a British man.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How do you still not sleep?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's unable to do that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the garbage.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was quiet.
I think I better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropical areas.
I think I made a good point.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this too good?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this thing.
I think Tom's wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What does Tom want?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he doesn't.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign over the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she's holding her head remind me of Mary.
Don't bother my way.
Now we're looking for them.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would have responded.
She always works hard.
Which state are you a citizen?
Elephant trafficking is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet with Tom.
I prefer cat dogs.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been coloring her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom doesn't know how to swim yet.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took a lot of care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't support this heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you urgently.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep your business up.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you can say.
Could not close temporary folder: %s
Looks like we're gonna have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
Now I'm looking for them.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree is sailing.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost doing everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is Tom's picture.
Can you call her?
Louder.
The forest was quiet back then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe I'll be ready to leave soon.
Tom can't sympathize.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car elsewhere.
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
The noise was pissing me off.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you liked Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluton soon.
"I see," the blind man said.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he lived here before.
Why is he such a Tom?
I have problems with the sinus.
I had low expectations from him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's skilled with a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website on the Internet.
They're dropping the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a virtue.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's on the ceiling.
Her face was tortured with sperm.
Tom's fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the company.
I'd understand what you're doing.
Tom's trying to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me this ugly?
Why do you blame them?
They're too expensive.
We're acting childish.
Tom was a Bosnian leg.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's up there.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, I don't even know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The tire's broken.
We made trees.
This is much better.
I'll get her to cut your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your oven.
You're a mess.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know what that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steg.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the disease.
Tom tried to help me.
They broke the door.
Tom came to stay with us a few days last spring.
You only think it's weird because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was last night.
That's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I don't have any use of that.
It's not good yet.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The filijan was empty.
Don't say.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't give in.
They're close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire came back alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where are these documents to be handed over?
Tom's got an eye bruise.
Tom's company is compromised.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't call you back.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came by this morning, Tom was still in pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom is blurred.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, what about you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They've raised my paycheck again.
I'll never even get there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in a horoscope?
I know how to go.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I've got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name on the list.
Tom made all this.
I won't betray her.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's soft.
Before that, there was no plant life in this afternoon.
You're incapable.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom's very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I have a great interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I couldn't give him these.
That's not what I'm learned.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, it violates all the rules.
Why are you not home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are people of opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was dropping pussy.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must feel lonely.
What did you ask on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly moving.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers at the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm learning art history.
I don't think so.
What's on the agenda?
There's plenty more.
Looks like these two are having a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
A moral choice is whether to translate or not. Some things are better left in the language that he produced.
You're nasty.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Take a look around.
Hand me the French key.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
Tom's courtesy thrilled me.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in her eyes and smiled.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars shine.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You found them.
I couldn't sleep over.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be informed in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally killed on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait anymore.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We could have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We're gonna go shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom's a grumpy.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone's been following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powder cure.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
Depends on your decision.
That's feasible.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
Tom was measuring you.
It's not attractive.
A few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her granddaughter.
That's our best chance.
I smell like flowers.
Tom stumbled.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
You've had a lot of difficulty.
She slowly developed hate for me.
I don't think that's what he's looking for.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Well, didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I.
My computer's up.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
So our conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take off his pants.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's good to see you.
Now you must leave, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
Screen releases green light.
English became my favorite item.
Things happened fast.
Where to evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we faced terrible news.
The knee wound is now rotting.
Clean your eyes.
Mary's scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom's a farmer.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying it.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered great losses.
Tom just needs some rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a candy with a mint?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'll have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
The blood bowl broke into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't a guy that was easy to agree with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a sea nuts.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The kids drew pictures on the sidewalk with the chalk.
You wonder what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married when he was 26.
We've already cleared that up.
You want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the capital either.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he hears something.
Tom's always trying to do what he thinks is right.
He doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What do you got in the plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You stink of shit.
What's your favorite nail elbow?
I'm studying piano.
They need the money.
He's a good swimmer.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I watched the TV when Tom came.
You're following us.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to get Tom mad at me?
Triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom's been counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary turned the lipstick off.
Oh, guess.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what you said to me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I looked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
You gave us a suspicious answer.
Awake me as soon as the sun is up.
Mr. Gorbachev, bring down this wall!
Tom seems amazed.
Tom's getting jammed.
It's just the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel like retiring.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was not to be sent at all.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you complaining about?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince has inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt this much in love.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick it up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll come in the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom's going to school with a car.
Did you look?
I'll have to think carefully about this.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everyone's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing the sayings?
It was a great show.
We need to go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night when I was 13 years old.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You just made me sick.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom's mad anyway.
Tom's gonna sleep.
Protect our peace!
Tom's well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a gift.
I know what happened in school today.
I have a glass of beer to sail my thirst.
Tom arrived in time.
Today's annoying TV.
Oh, great!
Tom found a four-leaf pod.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say good-bye to them.
Have you smoked?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The Association was established in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's awesome!
Water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom has arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
There, I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very alike with Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Watch out for the sparks flying from the firehouse.
It's just imaginary.
Tom's been silent on Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming about you.
Let's find out more about her.
I won't tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get a soul together.
I'm sure he's going to pass the closer exam.
We're headed to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He really kissed her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three bug spray cans.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these medicines for my father.
Kids love cakes.
He was quite abstained.
I can deal with Tom.
Tom's getting pissed.
This is from us.
In an emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary got Tom all the money.
Enough of this nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom's starting to whine.
Butterflies are nice.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom's out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked his cookies.
When's the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say bye?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty cannot be established objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom's unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Between me and Tom, it's over.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in desperation.
Tom screaming, woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak vision.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start immediately.
Is it over?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe was not too happy to see a peacemaker coming.
Open up.
Put your coat on.
It's possible you're wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my advisors about what objects to take.
I have already written everything that was to be written.
Make sure you don't care about me.
We can get some rest.
Boston's worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room underneath this?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll drive you.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in her ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I've seen how it works.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do anything like that before.
You're so brazen.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tateba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask Google for me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's on his own again.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop-Music is my favorite kind of music.
Half an hour passed.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was fascinating.
I can't see anything.
He's a rather unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one in that place.
Stop!
Do you want cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
The cows aren't clear at all.
That was very negligible by Tom.
It's bumped.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them cut you.
Sharing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom probably went out.
We didn't fight.
Tom penetrated inside.
At the same time, you're heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I can't live without you.
Let's say you're right for now.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom's a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm taking care of it.
Tom hit Mary's head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fucheric.
You need to help them.
Tom didn't even cry.
You wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the clutch.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and I was cold.
Nothing is sadder than foolishness and indifference.
They're all arguing.
Tom protested us.
What are the web sites blocking from?
Vampires live forever.
They both smiled.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate patlidzians.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
It's been my whole day cleaning snow.
His paralysis gets worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Changes are never easy.
Is Boston far?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could prepare it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very effective.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train when he went to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the clip out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
The guard's coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me a picture attached to the chimney.
The doves symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do anything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Anja's music is beautiful.
Is she a taxi driver?
I must be losing my ear.
Now that's over.
I'm getting some sleep.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a man product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I like your website very much.
I'll get you.
Press this button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom scattered his car.
You have to overcome the difficulty.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards carry eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
Lots of trees collapsed.
Lions don't differ colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer's fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're so far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Just a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you getting married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm shorter than you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed his wallet's gone.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm running like a pus from my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts at meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These guys didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar to the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
Why couldn't you sleep last night?
They cursed us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live for a long time.
Tom's a strong man.
Tom's sleeping very hard.
Are you helping him?
Looks like she's drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here with a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
We're all done here.
I'm sure.
Can you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
Something's weakened me.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who's gonna make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a hot night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan's actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer eggs than subpopology.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for madmen.
Why would I help him?
Tom lighted his shoes.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom borrowed me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hang on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom is still unable to talk to us.
They'd love that.
I'm a faggot.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom wants cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Get down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm chasing myself.
He drove fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's licking his boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my spending this month.
No one talks about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom washed his face.
What good do I have from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It makes me hot when he wears that clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live upstairs underneath this one.
They trusted her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't get it.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are kind of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows the choice.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to take care of his child.
I drew the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third luck.
We should take off.
This is the air dough popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let us strive for virtue and give up the vices.
You're smart.
I'm against this project.
Wasn't he tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I arrived too late.
I could've known Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There's writing reports.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just messing with you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep and finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
The diseases often occur at the most uncomfortable time.
This dog stares at me like he wants to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they weren't real people at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It's all passable, but good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom mean?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies at times.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I suggest we focus on the demand for a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Do you know how to write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this true in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed a towel to Mary.
She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger potion.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom was wondering what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I guess you read my report.
Tom has retired.
Don't repeat yourself.
The creepy are wormholes.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look so good.
You blew it, Tom.
It's warming him up.
Tom looked like he was disgusting.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become physically and mentally stronger.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would've stayed.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started going.
Do you have a map from Boston?
Don't you remember that.
"I got a nine at the chemistry test.
You were lucky you survived the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was a picnic.
How was the dance?
I'm a student.
It's just there.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm taking Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your wheel dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have a professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool that I expected you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two lines.
The titles should draw attention to the readers.
She was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I watched a French film with an English translation.
Tom mocked Mary.
Tom's back in confidence.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's diseases are false.
Dan had a serious relationship with Linda.
Everyone's back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at the wedding.
Which one would Tom choose?
The hospital isn't much there.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary's pregnant.
We'll stay.
I don't care about their dog.
I didn't sleep right.
I love freedom, I don't want and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty from ten to eleven years old, and boys aged 11 to 12 years old.
It's on its way.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will lighten up soon.
The wall is cold to touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
Many do this.
I still can't tell you.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was dressed up.
It was really cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door closed?
I've got a big sailboat.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag when you come home.
Tom taught me to sing.
"What book do you read?" "Roman."
You're burning the car.
That weapon is not a toy, boy!
Half of the kind is getting married.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
It's Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially useful job to redeem myself for everything I have done.
Tom tied his ropes.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom's wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I should have taken into account during the translation.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the oysters poisoned?
The kidnappers tied their eyes.
You're lying, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a college party.
Mary has provided a lot of support.
Tom's in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're a little rude.
Hey, put that back in place.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Mary like Tom?
I was waiting outside for you.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows the bonton.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Does your appearance fit your age?
How about me?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom mugged himself.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
The Falcons have sharp vision.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was trumpeting.
We want a new carpet.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom smiled politely.
Teanicon's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.
Tom downloaded the weight.
They went for a walk.
This is his mother's grandfather's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The Vulcan has become active again.
Tom told me he had to take care of some things.
How will that help?
Dan probably killed Linda by choking her.
The little island from far looks like a turtle.
Do the pastry bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop blaning yourself.
I'm thirty years old.
His action isn't perfect at all.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait.
You don't know how long.
The dog barked him.
Let's go to the movie.
Handsome women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He snapped him.
Mary felt her face warming up.
I know what upsets Tom so much.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed him.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom's a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom doesn't need to lift a jeep.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts so bad here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom's been interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be kind to each other.
Tom's a substitute.
I think I better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all look so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
He's got a lot on him.
Faith implies that you hope for something that your mind can’t hope for.
Tom was hanging out with me.
Tom was wondering why Mary wouldn't help him.
You've ruined your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live around here.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent to the value.
We rented a movie.
The death's coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Pick a weapon.
They chose a new government.
"I'll wash the dishes." "Okay, I'll wipe them."
I'd buy it.
He's the one who's pulling around in the back.
We appreciate our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom's wet.
They asked to raise their salary.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I'd have just wanted to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Throw your weapons down.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I'm the one you love.
We bought them those books.
That's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like a sweep.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The ventilator's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
Understood?
My day was full of action.
Is this yours, Tom?
My father's influenza.
I don't wait long.
Just look at you.
This is gorgeous.
It's missing empty before both points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should go to the dentist.
Soldiers fired.
Tom can't stand it.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom came out.
This is all I can do.
He adheres to his principles.
Tom's pissed off.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember him the first time I saw you.
They unlocked it.
Tom's a big boob.
Do you mind if I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm sleepy.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He rolls like an eel.
You should pay your rent in advance.
Put all the trash in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's time for that again.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes."
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at the desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk so fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see a conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to give him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take out the mask.
That's an option anyway.
You can go anywhere.
I'm blaming you.
I liked how you danced.
I need you a little.
They cheated on us.
Tom's the right one.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now disguise him.
She's white.
Sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We won't let you die.
My shoes are jamming me.
Tom hasn't said anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home in the rain.
It's nice to be alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Each color has its own meaning.
The old house was in bad shape.
I just don't feel safe about that.
I'm out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I screwed up.
He healed me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake Tom up.
How do I find him?
The ice has melted.
I spit blood out.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must have made it very easy.
They never caught me.
I love my country.
I haven't learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle it.
Don't spell me out.
Tom's comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They're looking in the mirror.
It's not my place to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Marie to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two have come against me!
I've never wore a sleeper in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
Kids sleep upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of it.
Make sure you don't bother.
We live by the sea.
Soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're freaking out.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It's probably not worth waiting.
I need to buy a new pendant for the room.
Tell Tom to write me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunshine today, but it's also cold.
What is this really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary left us from the first day.
Let's go hang out.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Aren't you going to eat the spinach?" "I'll eat it later."
This is my favorite item.
Tom downloaded the weight.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom's singing.
Tom's not that tall.
She wears a leather belt on the waist.
The fire was extinguished.
They're finally gone.
Tom shrugged Mary.
I'll go look for them.
Tom came while it was raining.
I don't want to use dilda. I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can stay only if you're quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I already told you everything?
Don't fight.
I expect help from you.
Tom's gonna go on his own.
Tom only had fives in school.
Tom agreed to me.
I'm sure your intentions are clean.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
You were great.
I wish I could tell my real name to people.
The dentist installed a temporary flat.
Tom actually smiled.
Tom's allergic to pollen.
They contacted local politicians.
Tom's taking notes.
They gave me this map.
We'll be conducting a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat the apples?
How long since Tom died?
Tom's weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a ten-dollar pocket a week.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you worked for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom's cutting me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with an elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What kind of games do you like to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come to us and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
Trust me.
I'm looking for you.
Do you like robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really sets me on fire.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often abused in school.
When does it start?
The bear bites himself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three brown spoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove's got a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's how I doubted it.
Tom doesn't do what he needs to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe isn't your friend or an alien, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What did you cook for dinner?
What did you do then?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked in the other direction.
Tom's the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'm gonna get rid of myself first.
Tom's 30 now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
He became a cukunbaba just a few days before he was ninety-nine years old.
Did you look everywhere?
It is important to keep in mind that no one is ever anything 100%.
He gesticulates while he talks.
Sit next to me.
Tom's thrilled.
Tom never borrows any money.
I'm truly happy about Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to a life sentence in 1633, yet because of his age and his health, they allowed him to serve that sentence in domestic detention.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those run over by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom scattered the tree.
The earth is still in the water, he'll probably give up the sword.
I was getting a nap.
What a collection!
Everyone's got names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog followed me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
She's trying to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom's very negligent.
The cloudproof is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom's a patient man.
Tom's had too much to drink.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there and kept his mouth shut.
I'm collecting postmarks.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
You live here?
The room looks like a cotton.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom Fusher's stuff.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peachs are mild.
That doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the fooly uncle sat in the living room.
Did I talk to you?
The mix falls from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You're welcome to wait here.
I got a Friday for French.
I want the class quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind blows.
It's a risk plan.
How do you get from here to the mail as fast as possible?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you going to mask yourself this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I don't feel that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there's an unforgivable act, it's the act of refusing to forgive.
The door's closing.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm thirsty for him.
He's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're making me stop.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky cheered up.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight.
That's not exactly what a man should be getting ready for.
Tom and Mary are playing remi.
I've made my decision.
Take care of our planet.
Tom relyed on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think I'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He raised the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked in two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
It's on his way.
The long walk called his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do that, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both smiled again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom felt the danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom's the highest guy in class.
Tom, you're growing up fast.
That was our only comfort.
No one would care.
Have you ever written in a diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it on my own?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't hold it.
I knew the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you screwing around?
Come on, Tom.
I'm gonna make sure I get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause a disease.
We're ready up and down.
Tom's got a sharp ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the drum out.
I helped him break the table.
I ate steak with potatoes last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is nasty.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom's drinking.
I slept in the bow.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could really work.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He's got an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever had in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom's rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Asal Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was sleng first.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I sent Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun if we went to the party.
You didn't save the bell.
He knocked me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stopped.
The fun continues your youth.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells unbearable.
As if I should know you?
Tom skilled to cover up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just sprayed Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a deadly coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves missiles.
You need to hurry.
Everyone's talking.
Oh, what's this?
Tom's a tramp.
We despise her.
He got in front of them.
Here, brother, half.
Tom sent to the table a new mushroom he just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's a dick.
The landscape is too high.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the Wine Victory.
We don't have a week.
I'll try to hold myself down.
The autumn has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the crash?
The water only takes three minutes to burn.
They could fire me for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so magnificent.
Dan was about Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer the question.
I want to get into class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are gifted with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of common humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunder.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to play himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen it work?
The soup is salty.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom penetrated the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It seems familiar to me.
I envy her.
I offered him to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The basil, the grief, the rosemary, the Timian, and Origano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a perceptive man.
Everything seemed all right.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me very much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have cheated on you, but she's gone!
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
It's good for me.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled a few coins.
The room was a buyer.
It's just to resolve this task.
They must remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's really fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunshine.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how bad it hurts.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but there he is.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to look into the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against ice.
I was pretty.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
Looks like he's not coming around to ask Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorie?
They'll win soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think.
I want to make faces for him.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I get your name and phone number?
Tom was firing me with a stone.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They stood underway in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I have a few reasons to remember.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't get it.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all underway.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called "The Russians Coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was away from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom is still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice are plague transmitters.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's slipping out.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write so well.
The king did not predict the fall of the monarchy.
I'm freaking out from Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep driving and caused a car accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greet Mary by waving.
It's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't mean to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French quite well.
Make sure you don't overreact.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need any help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
They disqualified me.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would he do that, Tom?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too worried about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite in orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here too soon?
That sounds very strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his ropes.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
The women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the firehouse.
Tom said I need to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom's not listening.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Tom's wandering around somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm's ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Any objections?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's a pointless fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to admit it.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little grumpy.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medelin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'll bring it.
Survive the kind of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in a big bowl.
If I meet Jesus, I will examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the wool going?
He wiped his wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I don't graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled the screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving with his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write skill.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, luft the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm baking my honey toast in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went picking strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom kicked his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost got there.
I was making cake.
Look at the number.
I was thrilled by your design.
You told me to call you anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom's choking.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month, I had an infectious bladder.
Look at the girls.
I'll take off the weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What benefits do we benefit from this?
I'm just with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick talk.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We've done nothing wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary may agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were totally confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has very good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's not good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he had to be redeemed.
It's a message for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not flat.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
He kicked the dog with a stone.
Tom kept staring.
It's 7:00.
I'm curious.
We can try.
As if I wrote this book myself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be self-esteemed.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary play with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to orore it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We don't see.
Mahmoud can't stand to dent.
No one listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgottenness and hatred usually go into pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
I got my pants off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admitted he spilled the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all scary.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited Loara's castles.
Tom is hopeless.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'm gonna help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your things are here.
Stay as much as your soul wants.
Grab me for a hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very pedent in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to hear?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you being in Boston for a while.
How much stomach should I do a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
What was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan's turning into a questionnaire.
You've got a lot of penetrated eyes.
Isn't that what you mean?
He seemed tired to me.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to the city.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Will you go back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Suck it and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems reliable.
Do you want some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
Squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They're developing addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat there and kept their mouths shut.
Get the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary's stuck on her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
You want me to get something from the supermarket?
The Mass is over.
Tom erased the knife blade from his jeans.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can set that up.
Are your palate bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer pint on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
We've got a seductive look in it.
Come on, don't be ashamed.
I don't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I better stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain how that's possible.
He looked at me sharply through the glasses.
Linda convinced Dan that he was chasing her.
Why would they mind that?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is sustainable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave properly.
I need to release us.
Why is heaven blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could break the aquarium?
I'm sick of it.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression for several periods of his life.
Shall I grab your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
Class is going wild.
There were footprints of penguin on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the helmet.
I want to scratch my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious for everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as your soul wants.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was robbing something.
She's studying English.
With such a tremendous dream, he will either become a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We'll survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spits the chewing tire.
Make it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easily bad habits are gained!
She started acting weird.
Probably, they won't pay off the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are as strong as you.
The president looked strong.
What can I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
They stole his cell phone.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were better off playing chess than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy talked about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people fear enough, everything can happen.
You're a tight town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's Tom bell?
He's very handsome.
Take care of the buyer.
Tom runs out of class a lot.
Now's the time to make up for it.
Most virgins have a whole hymen.
You can end it.
Why did you just burn two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, and when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom's interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited long in the rain.
You'll manage.
Does she have a dog?
We're resting.
Mary wore fake blinks.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking French better than he really does.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be the last.
Please accept the work offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look silly.
His mother's American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fusherski did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my decision, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works well.
Tom got sick bad.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese than cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning to stay in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy products in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Are they all having fun?
I've been watching all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to rebuild his driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where have you been born?
Xenie to the end.
Onenipol’s couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot she was once a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a manual thing.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear the letter off.
Let me try that.
Could you turn that cigarette off?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
Still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I don't have any more money.
The table is plastic.
The sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectation tool.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
You're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He hung me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
Bring us after lunch, we plan to walk into the park.
You have to answer the question.
Red light turned on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let him bite your conscience now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today, the first snow fell.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet on?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood's circling through the body.
I'll get him to go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
They won't help lies.
My thumb on my right leg hurts.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a pencil?
Tom bakes for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
They built their houses from a stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this right now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really mean that kind of thing.
There's a wind.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a handwalk.
Just sit there.
Tom can barely walk.
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the entire team.
What age did you start menstruating?
You're annoying me.
But not before the choir.
The company bankrupted.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very chatty.
You were right, guys.
It happens.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you going to eat at home or outside?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I'm drinking milk.
Don't piss Tom off.
It's a trouble job.
You need to get him to listen.
I was surprised that it was so easy.
I wish he were here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom calls Mary a lot.
Thank you, darling.
They have increased the territory of the kingdom.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom must have known about it already.
My mother's sister is my aunt.
I've been looking everywhere for them.
Tom is incapable.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny that.
It went red.
I have to go.
Who sleeps with dogs wakes up with bows.
His aunt is all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
It might rain tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom hooked up a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Listen.
Tom says he can pay.
She didn't show up.
I'll confess.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these counsel in mind.
His saying is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Get your stuff out of here.
Where did you put it?
Tom can't accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of it?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You don't have to be present for this.
Any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
My headache's over.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
Time here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't be too bad.
Isn't that unusual?
I accumulated myself from the wall.
The clock's broken.
Tom needs to be stopped.
Isn't that too much?
They know what happened.
Tom wrapped the scarf off his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was standing in the midst of ruins.
Tom's a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax for a second.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Pass me the claws.
Haskes love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Did you forgive me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the buffalo.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his father very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom went well today.
Milton hasn't slept well for a week.
When's the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he was planning to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's not a secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you preparing?
Now this is your house.
How about a little sushi?
How do you do it?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing just what I wanted.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
The lust is one of the seven mortal sins.
Tom's irresponsible.
I've always wanted to be a teacher.
Tom saw that Mary was about to say something.
I'll be out of town next week.
They sowed the seeds, raised him, and married him; and the stream of the stream was turning water.
He feels hate for his father.
Tom helped us escape.
Tom was in an accident.
Tom took Mary home.
I ski often.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom failed.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a print error.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Is the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan smiling the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely saved myself from getting caught.
I can't get involved.
You beat them.
They shut up.
Tom's back soon.
I'd be in.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when he exploded.
Who's going to make up for the zyan?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing bothers me here.
You tricked me.
It's for the sin.
Nothing is sacred.
Looks like Tom's pretty proud of himself.
In fact, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're embarrassing her.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was three corners away.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red at sundown.
I came to wish you luck.
It would be a pleasure for you to come.
They must be happy.
We have to fix this.
I speak bad English.
We'll handle it.
The bread is made of flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this very well.
Do you want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them and told him.
Dan may have quarreled with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's warm here in hell.
I missed that.
This is your work!
Please come back to me.
It's cold in here.
Let me congratulate you on the wedding.
Kids, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Does your dog bark?
Wonderful!
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go pick them up.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom's gone astray.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you leave.
Tom came here alone.
I forgot my scarf.
We've had a lot of time.
Tom wanted everyone to think he died.
Scientific research often requires difficult compromises.
Tom just took out his protesis.
I have to try and find him.
I've taken care of it.
Tell me the details.
Are you busy with anything?
Go wake Mary.
You almost missed it.
I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of anyone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
She's relaxing very much.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was compromised.
I wish I hadn't done that.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole is tight.
You should go help him.
Are you enjoying that?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom dropped the sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long is the road going on?
I'm fine, thank you!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's getting dark.
Tom's raised.
I'm surprised Tom left with Mary.
He's blind since he was born.
The book contains fifteen resumes.
Tom worked all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
The socks and shoes are new.
I haven't had pizza lately.
Something wouldn't make me happy anymore.
I suggest you learn more.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
Tom was buried in Boston.
Tom's not my cousin.
What's Tom talking about now?
How are you two?
Dalida died of overdose with sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign down, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
Tom just put on one shoe.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them you're not really big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a slaughter.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
It's raining.
Ish, dog!
They jumped in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.
Tom didn't come home at all last night.
I think we've eaten enough.
This is very difficult for them.
The witches don't cry.
Tom taught me to make pancakes.
The one that washs the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks terrified.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can drive you.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're unorganized.
I insist.
I'm sure Tom's gonna do it this way.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the task?
We have to go back for him.
You're rude.
Do you have any sports?
It just sounds boring.
Get him in there.
Tom lied to us the whole time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The men in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely incorrect.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait anymore.
I only practice to look beautiful when I'm naked.
Thousand years are a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
Honest word.
We've got three guards working on a shift.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Can you present in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Get your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom shut his mouth.
Well, don't you hate him?
Stop acting like a child.
Tom's not a bad guy.
He never hired them.
I like cakes.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was so sweet.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
Soon he will leave the home of his parents.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.
My husband is a doctor.
It's spider bite.
Tom didn't really want to live in Boston.
The price of wisdom is greater than the price of the pearls.
Tom's obviously upset about something.
I'll wait here.
I know I should sleep now.
I can get her to help you.
This new song is called "Slipper".
It's deeper than that.
Henry doesn't have more than six bucks.
We all have our price.
The answer to both questions is no.
They're amazing.
The legend says she was a siren.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
Was Tom in Boston last week?
I've used to talking in public.
He cried out of luck.
Tom got out of jail.
I'm glad to work here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for the green to start.
Do you want me to massage your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I took my head right away.
Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
Next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to end it.
I'm going to change.
He hung up on me.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, my movie's gonna blow.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, but never could have happened here.
Tom was warming up before the fire.
This is not what I want to talk about.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
Tom swims every day.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
Why don't you call him?
I want to use these.
Tom's allergic to a fly.
You should try writing respectfully.
I'll sit right there.
She's older than him.
I baked them a cake.
Tom's very patient.
We can get started.
Come alone.
Your pencil ran out of your pocket.
Tom asked for his lawyer.
Write it to Tom.
I had to help her.
Don't risk it.
Isn't that good news?
Suppose she was here.
Tom always makes me angry.
Tom's just watching.
Here's your schedule today.
Tom waited for us.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom's an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is what you're gonna do.
Tom told Mary he loved her.
Well, she's not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was raining two days ago.
The job is not embarrassing.
If you bite me, I'll bite you.
You really should have let me get a cab.
I baked an apple pie.
The hoove cannon of the horse's hoof calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book fully covers the subject.
I think this is over.
Linda wore humble dresses all the time.
Have you smoked?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He outranked his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom contacted Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he wanted to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna have to ask Tom for permission.
His joke made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee a day are too many?
Tom hates running.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I was dancing with my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling each other.
Try to figure this out.
What kind of man are you?
I should try to help them.
Can I gather a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom makes three times more than me.
I cried one.
Write your birth date.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about this.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary won't be able to come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom stuck his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's petty.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do it.
Is this your bag?
It will help her sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll do the dishes.
They've been scanding for half an hour.
So far, he's been working very intensely lately, but he doesn't see the least of it.
Dan found out Linda was looking for the police.
I'm cooking dinner.
Please come to me next Saturday, if you like.
I'm not sure.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's asleep tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hatred.
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming by.
I'm just as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have done that without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
He spent the night drinking in a meat tavern.
I'm in.
Do you need a rand?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to make it up to you.
They're coming again.
You're really sweet.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke anyway.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen the rainbow.
I don't think they're following us.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary get out of jail.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired.
But that's no argument!
Tom got a drink.
What am I supposed to tell the kids now?
Leave Tom alone.
I've been through the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
Then we were just a few people among a group of gorillas.
She started to stick her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I didn't invite Tom to my party?
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
Are you traveling a lot?
Have you told Tom about the back pains you've got?
That's what everybody does.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.
Tom's collecting postmarks.
I want you to find her.
The water shines on the sun.
And it is a multitude consisting of members of the B, B, and A.
Tom's free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a fraud.
You know you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom's got thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom exercises a violin at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I use this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's so fun.
Let's do it tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I long for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You're burning the car.
She managed to learn how to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the strength of the will when it comes to exercise.
Come to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room's a ardume.
At your service.
I like to watch football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need this much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean.
I've found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to mix with sun cream.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely hearing.
Don't talk.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days do you usually need to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We'll have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep over.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was chaos.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom's gonna wait.
You're too hungry to get down.
The real story is a little different than what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon slowed down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she immediately knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; either way you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny eat pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something that will distract our minds from our problems.
I called her yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells marine schools.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom's not like his brother at all.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't possibly do it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie this knot.
Give me back my money.
You have to show up first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you you could be a professional drummer.
You stole my new hand watch.
Doesn't look much different.
You've studied.
Tom made Mary room on the bench.
We're harassing him.
It's good.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know if I should be happy or not.
Did I get in?
Tom wrote to me and told me about his journey.
Your excuse is right or not.
I don't know anyone like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the precious stones last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom's your teacher.
I already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetus movements?
I can't do this alone.
You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did it.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost done.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I travel to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom got the fog.
They tied my eyes.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me a mess.
When will you visit us?
There are tragedies happening every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm listening well.
Give me those leaves.
You can take mine.
Tom won't like it.
All comments are unnecessary.
Did you do this for me?
Can you call for help?
Tom made his mouth cry.
It smells like cheese.
Tom's not delusional.
The patient is suffering from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
The virtue without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom looks offended.
We know him.
I slept there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a couple they are!
Did Tom get early this morning?
Your complaints upset me.
I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's loud in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found it.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty chatty.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going and point.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom's cooperating.
Snow is a deep one rate.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's chewing the beetle.
I'm gonna go look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will be done for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom listened immediately.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without anxiety.
You misunderstood me.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're so attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open on page nine.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We were arguing.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not quite happy with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom has not been returned yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me long.
Tom's in the living room watching cartoon movies with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his own about what happened.
He was in the mud to his knees.
You told Tom about it, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
There's nothing you can prove.
Tom hates green peppers.
Don't you panic?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom's intelligent.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big for you.
We'll turn back.
Is there anyone else?
Not all people are equal, but it's good news, because it means not all people are bad.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of interpunctive signs is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom was wondering if Mary was already awake.
Do you want to get you home?
That house was built by bricks.
We didn't come to any conclusions.
Tom came around 2:30.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
Tom tried to escape.
I've got a cat insertion.
The crowd applauded.
I'm letting the detellins grow on the edges.
I think Tom's mean.
The door was locked.
I'll get your daughter.
I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We've depressed.
I was too tired to go on.
Everything has its own sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's on his forehead.
I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson last night.
Can you use this page like Twitter?
Shouldn't be too hard to finish the report by 2:30.
Tom's been doing this for a while.
Heteronormality is in close relationship with sexism.
She's got a legograph.
Are they your bags?
For what reason do you learn English?
Did Tom leave already?
Tom must have acted important.
Tom's still at home.
It's worth watching.
My breasts are growing.
I'll talk by tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
Dan's back in London.
My dad bought me a digital hand watch for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom's a human hater.
Don't you feel lonely?
Did you make coffee?
Don't look so cute about it.
Stand up when you talk to me.
He's always funny.
The forest was very quiet.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom's inclined.
Most of the clothes the Europeans wear are produced outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can find it online.
When I was younger, I always traveled with a stop.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
I bought a pair of shoes.
How negative you are.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here?
When I pee, something comes up like a pus.
You beat her.
The stars showed up.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I often play volleyball.
Where's the shirt I bought you?
That's what's gonna teach them in order.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom ran.
We're ready to fight.
I advise you to listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everyone thinks this book is so good.
Tom was hired.
This time has passed very quickly.
There's no way out.
The rain in the night made the attempts to save the survivors from the down ferry.
My wife's hiding something from me.
What can we offer the guests?
Tom's pissed off.
Look at the number.
He must have a key.
Half the apple.
All the balls are yellow.
I have a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they hit anyone?
The factory produces toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What did you sing?
I can figure it out myself.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like merchandise.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of humanity.
It's still for sale.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
I would've had a carriage by time.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do the job in one day.
You almost got stoned by horror.
Suddenly, I felt old.
They're pissing me off.
It was night.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge his late father.
Tom took the cookie.
I've been studying French since I was 13.
Men don't really differ so much from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite facial cleaning oils and skin cultivation.
I'm sick of French.
I don't care if there are twenty women.
The bull's sore.
Tom walks.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I get you one?
Babours are usually mild to taste.
I'm shocked.
It's possible it's raining today.
We were ready.
Let's go to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're pretty.
Wash up.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I have something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and watch her.
Wouldn't you start cooking hair from that?
How are you gonna run away?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg's broken.
How are you going to do that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd like to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these messes from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing.
She's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom for the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be true.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You're not sleeping all night, are you?
It happens.
The noise will wake the baby.
I bit the spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the sofa with Mary and watching TV.
Nothing bothers us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Nice to see you, Tom.
How are your parents?
I'm usually not at work on Monday.
I'm a fool that I trusted them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to the service every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He'd be broken.
There's a crowd in the bar.
He's quitting the idea.
Tom wondered more.
Who gave them so much money?
We have to buy them a gift.
When did the war end?
Did the dish machine work?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, the soup is so salty.
Did I miss a lot?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Do you mind if I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're gonna have to learn harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There's algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one loves Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom caught two seats.
I'll send you the recipe.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Pick what you like most.
Your offences dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
Looks like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pens.
This is very confusing.
I'm bringing terrible news.
If it was possible, I would just like to experience the bitter love that I have in the basics.
I saw Tom around here.
They're surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom's blown up the movie.
It's a stupid rule.
Did Tom suggest this?
Did Tom ask who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to watch the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We cut off our conversation.
Training.
The cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't focus on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became addictive.
I just want money.
I don't say bad things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How badly was Tom hurt?
Was he compassionate?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
The beggars can't pick.
Is there sugar?
Dan and Linda finally moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
He looked funny.
Tom plays in a band.
Now we live together.
You've been busy.
Excuse me, it's not a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship has changed the direction.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April-li-li!
Tom used to say that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you'll have a job to do.
Open up, Sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
You want me to take a picture with or without a flash?
He and his sisters ate ice cream while the radio was released.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can handle this problem on my own.
They are too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We don't sell alcoholic drinks and cigarettes to minors.
I came back with a bus.
Here's how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college professor.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe that's the cat.
The fight doesn't seem to be nearing the end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's scattered.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up from the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you touch anything?
Let's do it now and that's it.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be fine.
Think what you want.
Where can I find a hospital?
Don't ruin the party.
I can make it happen.
I'm not discriminating.
I'll go if Tom goes too.
We'll be back in a month.
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you drink the medicine they prescribed you.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I got in.
I want to swim.
It was from her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We need to get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started climbing.
Tom likes you so much.
Tom called Mary.
Now I'm putting pepper on eggs for the first time.
I'll manage.
The cure worked.
Tom can play the guitar.
Who broke it?
The linear is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you very much.
I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I don't remember buying this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, lazy!
How long ago?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd be avoiding Tom for a while.
I won't wait to find out.
Let's keep this conversation out there.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I've failed you.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
No one really loves us.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom's got some candy.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
Everything's ready.
She's indisposed.
It's all in the file.
Let's not ruin it.
Swab yourself.
Did you get rid of it yet?
Tom's tapping.
Can anyone hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I've fallen in love with you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
It was hard for us.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a chain.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was one of them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital and he's recovering from what he overdoses.
He broke the nut with his teeth.
I can't believe we were ready to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just do your best.
Tom's the face.
When you go to a date with a girl, you have to be confident.
Tom, please, this isn't even the right time or the right place.
We've got her under surveillance.
Tom's untrusted.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cup cap up.
It's a good training.
This capital is its own sight.
I should have refused.
I had to take into account what could happen.
That was my tactic.
I've lived here for years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my libe.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the cover on the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should be sorry for them.
I'm not barking.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I'm not commenting on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is really hot.
I want to live in Brazil.
Cancel.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom's overly swearing.
Nobody walks to Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
You didn't bother me.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through deeds.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America, you're supposed to leave a tip to the waiter.
Such behavior was childish by his side.
I'm walking with her.
That would be okay.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable about Mary.
I don't need them.
Did Tom give you that?
The cars replaced the chariots.
I've been kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is delicious.
We're on the same plane.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom's very hard on himself.
She's a nerd.
Lemonade is cold.
The lamp was swinging back and forth.
Tom seems insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom's a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why should I worry about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom doesn't have manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banderana on the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell off the tree.
Tom told Maria he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you catch a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was half-sleep.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the mild things and the books.
This is a lot worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna lose his mind.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I've got a stick.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I was staring at the man.
Take care of Tom.
They look familiar to me.
We have a job for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river passes through the valley.
Get in touch with her.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you to be with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom was deeply interested in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see him.
Did you get some sleep?
It's probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have snow Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
His concert was great.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're troubled enough.
I don't think Tom's gonna help us much.
Tom seems worried.
I care about him.
Tom's amazing.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's sympathetic.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to ask if he could help.
We could've handled it.
This is no one's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
It's hotter today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend was fully equipped, with pool, barbecue, football playground and pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While eating pizza, he was boring his sister.
We should've given up early.
That's close enough.
Tom's nice.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far was in vain.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned the heat on.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds quite acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar contrasts: one was honest and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't kneel.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I'm not gonna stick.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it in a butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two species in Ireland.
One thing at a time, the boys came to see what I read.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I say to him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on the bed and talk on the phone.
These are amazing.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was enthusiastic.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need the pride to carry them.
The noise disturbed the whole city.
The one who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They blinked.
You're mean.
Did you hand over Tom's note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have tiny breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing messages to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom did.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears attack clothes.
Tom was a boss.
That's ugly.
There could be discussions about that.
Girls don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem. It's mine.
Before I go to bed, I had three cold pills.
Maybe Tom's wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled little brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be boring.
I'm raising goods.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mom had to borrow her keys.
Tom's got a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Did Tom participate, too?
The thief turned into a cop.
We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're evil and you're rejecting.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom's not seeing anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They fully renovated the building's facade, and when I walked by her car, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do it without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her sedative.
This has nothing to do with the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult test.
I'm gonna get a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's running out.
They're gonna make you a mustache.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge crashed when one of the ropes broke.
The geiser throws out the hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here by my own will.
It's to protect you.
Someone always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he wins the lottery, he'll buy himself a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to the elderly.
The precious stones include aquamarin, amethist, emerald, quartz, and rubin.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission earlier.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're cutting the chickens off.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I'm having a quick lunch.
Tom remembered all sorts of things that nobody else remembered.
You can easily tell them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
From all the languages I've learned, the French was the easiest.
Tom's doing homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Should I go?
The boy looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are nice.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project doesn't go well.
Why don't you eat meat?
You've been expressing your idea in particular.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom showed up to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Did you get there with a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do as it suits me.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I hit something weird.
When's the last time Tom came to visit?

Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That's what surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually portable disease.
That doesn't surprise me.

Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom's incredibly calm.
I'll ask Tom to take some time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you get?
Tom was struggling to get rid of him.
What do they want me for?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not a good time now.
I'll be home by noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old-fashioned guy.
The question is how Tom did it.
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
Now I can't ask them.
Tom's got a wave of hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's very strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question.
The bushes are burning.
Tom was affected.
I'm being bitten by a conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own tongue.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'm gonna have time to do that.
Tom got drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're having a lot of fun.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you agree with your parents?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom's got a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I honor you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I hear music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benchs are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom gathered his hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where did you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People try to eat here.
I need you more than you could imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a hand watch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed the job.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide that.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom keeps climbing.
Tom might be able to burn your car.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to me in the eye.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to wash up.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
They'd just bother Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exponents.
Maybe I can find her.
I've learned it by mind.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach so they spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
Everyone was on guard.
He's a little deaf, so talk louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's about you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in their own place.
Wasn't it terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom wore his shirt off.
When was the last time you cleaned up your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was really good!
Control yourself.
The multiplication is commutative, and the division is not.
I'm kidding.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What have we done wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom shook up loud.
It was better.
Tom started snoring.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We're hearing two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed to her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was freaked out.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the refrigerator.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom released his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam clouded my glasses.
So, no, no, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We were all cheering for her.
Didn't you see the al flag?
Get a good mood!
I told you it would be hard to do.
I think I found one of those.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Although I am a merciful man, I am a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there a problem I need to know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so angry.
A lot of people hunt.
She deserves the prize.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
There's something we need to investigate.
Tom, open your eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met in a mean.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The cure must be drank on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like our job is not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
It's my fault.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you an everlasting bread.
Marcipan pigs don't boil.
Tom's getting conscious.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good at that.
Tom might be here today.
Tom doesn't differ between reality and fantasy.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no strength of will.
Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on already.
You better die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at 11:00.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher paycheck.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it is from another dimension.
I'm bored.
What's the time?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've made up a cure for it yet.
Every member has to attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the uglyest snowman I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on that subject.
You're just.
I'll go.
Today's my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar to me.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are very sweet together.
You're so beautiful.
Tom and Mary had a good time together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's the luck?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
You ripped off your key bone while you were dancing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was rude.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom's sticking to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I need to call her.
He asked me if I wanted to cook anything.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom go down the hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves about that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play piano?
It's time to close.
Leave it to me.
The stone smashed down the hill.
She went to a hairdresser.
Tom's crazy anyway.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't cost his heart.
You don't have to comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
Pingwin's very cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look terrified.
I could make it easy for you.
Put the phone down.
I would never leave home for slippers.
I think Tom's a serpent.
I don't give a shit about a terrible infection, and the ovary came out.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't work.
He doesn't come considerably.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He sometimes behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Trust in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapable.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cupcake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to gossip.
I have questions on tons.
This is an interesting, funny, even trembling story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is a sacred land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We've got everything.
What's a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where the hell did you find her?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we argued.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for decades?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you in love with him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are gathering in this room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little sloppy.
