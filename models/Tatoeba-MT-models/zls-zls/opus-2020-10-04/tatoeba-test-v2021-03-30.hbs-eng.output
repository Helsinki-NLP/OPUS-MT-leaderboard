That seems inhuman to me.

How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he had his belt tied.
It seemed yellow.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firm against compromise.
Eat slowly.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Keep trying.
She doesn't use salt when she cooks.
We got off the train.
We were always close.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
What's this?
I went to the hospital.
We've never been here.
Sing!

Everyone was looking for Tom.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain that to you.

I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
He went out for a walk.
Tom finally realized that Mary was right.
It was a crazy year.
Get the fuck out of here, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his home before.
You owe me a lot.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's like summer outside.
It's only been one day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
They're waiting for us.
What's your story?
Begin.
You have no idea how right you are.
I've been looking for you.
It's going to take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
I forgot.
This knife is not sharp.
Just close your eyes.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
Everyone's the boss in his house.
These are my best friends.
I swim in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
What school did you go to?
The clouds are getting darker.
He's gentle by nature.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.

Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You always sing.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
May I ask you a question?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth were squeezing.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Stop.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom's still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet astas are the kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"You learn from your mistakes" and "The experience is the best teacher," they say, but on long paths even the best teacher angry, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Share the tickets, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in that town.
They already have one.
You really don't have to do that.
Is your watch correct?
I hope it's dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches next day?
At least 50 passengers died.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not so happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world education is disappointing.
First thing my mother said was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I only listen to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Based on what we know he's innocent?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was being persecuted by nightmares.
I've made my decision.
My hands are cold.
Thank you so much!
The best lecture you can attend is what you don't understand.
That won't have any effect.
Don't blink.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm the person responsible.
We have wine.
I wrote his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Italy is the peninsula.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
It's his car.
Of course!
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all the others.
Sign here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife Edith.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love from one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with major oil and gas investments.
I have a white horse.
Good luck!
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Where did you get that idea?
Say hello to your friends.
That company's on shaky feet for bad debts.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom said Mary was driving the car.
Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We need to respect personal rights.
What's that thing with your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you guys eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him what you like.
Don't run in front of the mine!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
Tom must have been trying to clean this up without soap.
The rain was so heavy that we decided to visit him the other day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
Merry Christmas!
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
His unkindness made her angry.
She turned down my proposal.
The trains in Serbia are terribly slow.
In that case, let's go.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
Gimnastics is his strong side.
He's got a good memory.
Tom's been fired.
Cold limbs thorn.
Tom's not very nice.
He found himself a hero on a hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
Did you know Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
Now he's pretty busy.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
The refugees are welcome.
Many economists disobey this fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is that lake?
What age is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't stretch out.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We don't have such an example.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen enough for now.
Turn around!
Be kind.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
It took four kilos of gold to golden the winning medals.
I'll have dinner in seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers to his head.
Take care of me, and I'll look after you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with a touching man?
Will you talk to Tom about me?
I bought this yesterday.
What do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak plainly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one is unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
You'll need it later.
This has been a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income's down by ten percent.
You'll see her.
It may be difficult to visit an unknown field.
They're willing to talk about the problem.
Cheese.
Okay, you don't have it.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After my long deliberation, I eventually did things by chance.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen a lot?
They were walking along the beach.
We're cutting down.
Can you talk to me?
Lower the TV.
I wear short sleeves in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis the locker?
Don't be a road bully.
Tom could tell us how to do this.
I'm just leaving.
Tell him I'm innocent.
She spends three bucks a day for lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The task of a lawyer is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom's going to remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with it, the porn will be made with it.
Canada is a land-mother hockey on ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom saves money so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try it.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
All right, how about you?
This is, without any doubt, an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
It leads to the city this time.
I'm not happy with that.
I baked my tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
What did science ever do for us?
Stop watching TV and start learning.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find a book in the library.
The police found stolen money.
I've never seen it before.
I got here a few minutes before you.
Fantastic!
I didn't do it either.
How much is a bottle of beer?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell nice.
It was obvious Tom didn't want to kiss Maria.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flower flowers.
What a pity!
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm done fighting.
I have plenty of room.
What are you going to do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
A young man is often reckless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's get something to eat.
That's what you think?
Can we agree not to agree?
I try to be careful.
Always a problem when it comes to my child.
Not yet.
She wants to study abroad one day.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I've been working on it day after day.
Do you have your favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there's grass, there's no water, no grass.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else in the room with him.
Better merciful than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
There's trouble waiting for you.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
There is no word "liberty" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
That bag's mine.
Tom left before I arrived.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom's Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is a base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I've been told nothing.
The fire spread to the next building before the firemen arrived.
Tom didn't make friendships as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It's one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Close your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
He's got his clothes off.
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
He's American.
Tom's only talking to Mary.
No doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You're getting fat real fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I can do a lot of things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one who's going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Let the imagination go to your will.
Okay, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't get in that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary made a mistake about that.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
If you do, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a melem for a soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have gotten involved in your silly business.
The light just disappeared from itself.
Tom begged Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the policeman!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's savings to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What do the papers say?
The system completed repairs after three years of volunteering work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm Klaustrophobic.
He lives around in the white house.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road connection to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
Hello, how are you?
She got four e-mails.
I am truly happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I have something in mind.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without any difficulty.
It's not easy sports.
Bitcoin is a cryptocratic.
I'm just not gonna do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
I find it hard to express what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
Turn right on the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I try to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
Do you know why I'm here?
I hope they don't notice my mistake.
I must have ate something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too hard.
Avoid addicts on the color dilutor.
I liked that one.
He didn't hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller-bones?
We're out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's a nice time today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletters of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend a meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy hanging out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have the right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was spinnin' around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come over sometime?
She wonders how that's possible.
Santa lives in the north pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
I tried to be nice.
Mary is the wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having a hard time talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice smiled.
She can't bribe.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll keep you posted.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger moves, creating music that is very pleasant to listen.
Strong winds broke a lot of branches from the trees last night.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare the field for negotiations.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed because of his mistake.
The way to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is built by brick.
I didn't write this.
I went down to the wrong bus station.
I can't feel partially responsible.
People have been good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Are you a student?
Can I scratch for a cigarette?
I could come with you.
Take some.
Come in.
Burge Kalifa is currently the highest cloudcoder in the world.
How many blankets on the bed?
You really don't have to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
I'm fat.
To extend to the choir, it's necessary to learn to read notes.
Tom's asleep.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very lewd.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human being to always prevail in the interests of others.
I eat here.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was declared captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stupid, insensitive children can sometimes grow into sociopaths.
I'd like her to be with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She's not familiar with the hatred of others.
This will make the job much easier for us.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks could play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will be here soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
You're drinking coffee?
Some of us feel that such views are pure madness.
It works.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any of the letters to Mary until he was away.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to take this job.
We all know Tom is guilty.
She's Chinese.
I don't want vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs her.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled the fatter ending out.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't without feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt mild nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I peed to the skin.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write the number?
That's not the reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
The worst headaches have been caused by unprecedented ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
What's your name?
They try.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom's cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you tell the silver from the skeleton?
Hands up!
I don't work out as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think it's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
It's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In a short matter of fact, I disagree.
I'm responsible.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it's impossible to live.
I used to play the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
He drew himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
They bow apples and pears, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The professor's saying is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like practicing.
I love you!
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I contributed.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
I can read German, but I can't say it.
That doesn't exactly sound like you.
She's accomplished her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Craziness crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a book for children.
You're right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
It's like I don't know it!
Let's not talk about this right now.
Have fun.
Time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a rich trader.
The meeting execution is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being judged.
I have a meeting tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
If you help me, it'll be fine.
I've been squirrel.
That was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin was encrypted.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go and take a look.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Or remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you the pictures of Eplđek's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mec." "Yes." "What did you say you learned from it?" "I realized that Philips' screwdriver was convincing, but not misleading; and that Rerittie was a heavily charging things that I think should do as a friend."
I've always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I don't want to take any more time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
"Did he explain?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is magical.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I will do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom's waiting.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
Students didn't know how to answer.
Shame on you.
I'm not a nightbird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
Good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's going to call.
He lighted the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth about what Tom says.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight has fallen from a horse.
I didn't forget.
There are islands on the sea.
I'm looking into it right now.
Mini skirts are modern again.
What are we really looking for?
She's accomplished her goal.
Tom can do as he will, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medicine will ease your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together quietly for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes on a train.
He's addicted to Starbuck coffee.
The book's on the table.
Two sides are going to hold speeches this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Carton's stronger than paper.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.
I've never noticed that before.
It's happening.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in a gypsy.
Mom just went shopping.
It's hers, isn't it?
I'm proud of you.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That one needs help.
Defend yourself.
He grabbed a cab to the hospital.
This exceeds all borders.
My house is looking south.
I miss you so much.
Do you know how to joggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.

How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.

Tom and Mary are different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion about who's gonna win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not want to meet and even it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment for him. One such desire is the desire for everlasting life. If it were fulfilled, a man would become completely ill of eternal life, and would long for death.
Water is fluid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.

The news's here.
No one really wants us.

He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!

We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll be in a hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It really is pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
You too, Brut?
The house Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
It's snowing.
I thought you needed help.
Does this make sense?

He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
I know your name.
Let's hear your excuse.
Dad said no.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog is lying down.
Don't talk.
This information is classified.
You taught us that.
Nope.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not leaving me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message, Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the first row.
Mary pushes her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
Little blooms flourish at night.
I counted to two hundred.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try.
I'll stay home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of the nerve.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Tomorrow's Christmas.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom tricked you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work at the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals harassed animals with recklessness.
I'll live in Cambodia.
How angry are you going to be and yelling at us?
Please stop here.
How important does that really matter?
Shall we have an appetite?
Tom keeps complaining.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it already.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he told her.
I like to play the music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I was there twice.
Deeds speak more than words.
Is this the place Tom is sitting?
Enough!
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's fattened.
The lion is the king of the jungle.
It's my fault.
Don't answer.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It takes a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
I'm so tired I can't learn.
I've never seen his face.
Tom's very careful.
When are you leaving?
This report isn't very well written.
I want a new bike.
It stresses that this last move of the government has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
Five brothers worked together on a farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.
Don't forget to wet your sunscreen.
Tom did not try to deny Mary's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
Thank you for accepting my request for a friend on Facebook.
His hair covered almost his whole face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world in size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow from the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who forged his degree into college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I had thought of that.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you, really?
We've all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just an essay problem, it's all these terrible questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I want to see her very much.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started yelling.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean it up.
Can I use your vocabulary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this one?
Most people love chicken.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I was burnt badly.
Fall back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Look out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by splashing stones on your car.
I became a retired man after fourteen years of work at the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
I just took a bath.
Do you doubt me?
Fortunately, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
In general, kids love candy.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
The gold is much harder than the water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled the fatter ending out.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's not even.
Everything's fine with me.
It's clear Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was 12; then I was interested in languages, but not in that extent; now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time for me to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom so much.
Tom won't escape.
I'd leave.
I don't take a bribe.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
That's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just miserable.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm a homosexual?
Anyway, he will surely come.
Please leave this place as clean as you wish to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
What's your name?
I understand.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm crying.
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be done soon.
Learn as you do.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
They won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
The book's on the table.
He's a real aristocratic.
I'm doing my job.
Everything's quiet again.
I failed.
We know.
Tom's going to graphic design school.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
Music is his passion.
You should face up to that reality.
Light waves pass through space and different materials.
We managed to escape just in time.
I'm sick of it.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Cartage must be devastated!
How much does that cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I don't object to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Take some.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?
I'm starving from all this running.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of that word.
The spider tickles me.
He's talking about how he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we'll get through the jungle.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
The committee recommends that those who complained should be compensated for the proportional part of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of superreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice, it's very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
Time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Either way, it's past.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the name of the file before you try to retrieve the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things work out for me.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of his work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much will I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been up for his exam?
Some book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to shoot stones in a glass house.
I'm gonna scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
You can't touch that.
Don't squirt.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do it.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary's a retired nurse.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the fatter end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We also call Roberta "Bob."
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
They're teachers.
The government fell after the parliamentary vote.
You're not funny.
Tom left instead of Mary.
The notebook's not yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car down the street.
I don't know Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I've been so upset by the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have some tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not exactly like that.
They know you.
I've passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was as cold as a syringe.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We were walking through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out at the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song only for you.
His house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him any money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We were studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mailbox?
What are you suggesting?
It's said that love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Have you talked about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They were moving forward slowly.
Why is love so hard?
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm late, aren't I?

Blue suits you.
Come visit us soon.

What are you and Tom doing?

I don't know if I'll have time.

Something was lying on the ground.
Kids are flowers of our life.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
She called him, but he didn't hear her.
Water is life.
What are you doing today?
He will win the championship by his own chance.
After silence, what is most precise is inexplicable is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy little girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a beautiful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't work too much!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
We're gonna have to walk now.
I'll release you.
I strongly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we make a Facebook group so we can discuss learning foreign languages?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Stop smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me a number.
Neither can I.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom was afraid of me earlier.
Tom whispered something Mary and she smiled.
But why?
May I take a look at your ticket?
What happens now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They set up a library of new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a knocking error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to make it up to you during your student life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a haircut.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could come with you.
Life costs are rising.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.

How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.

Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.

So what did Tom see?
How many umbrellas is this?
I'm on it.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.

They'll know what to do.

He took off his clothes.
He saw Leila's reaction on his own.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?

She's got short hair.
He's driving the lights.
My right hand's jammed.

You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy mother's day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everybody appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Please, have a seat.

I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
I need you to talk to me.

Where were you in Japan?
Everyone's gone.

The more I know people the more I admire dogs.

What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs her.
It's obviously about a tipfeler.
Are we done here?
Do I see it?

Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
Excuse me.
I wasn't home all day yesterday.
I'd appreciate it if you stayed until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.

Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
The cost will grow soon.

Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It hasn't gotten that much worse.
And they lived happily ever after.
Tom's red.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.

Is that a yes or no?

Dear God, it's really hard for people to pay attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I'm thrown into a great villain.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written Mary in so long.
That history tells us interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just hang up for a second?
I hate science.
Students didn't know how to answer.
Do you have a book?
He's got two cars.
If they don't mind you, they won't bother you either.
It's a good intent.
I've already thought about it.
Men stay children their whole lives.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were sleeping.
I'm just looking around.
Where's the beach?
Anything you want to know in particular?
Welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interaability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of students were in a meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You're opening the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters think Mary is the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom won't vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll do fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I'm probably not going to read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make way.
Tom is also very famous in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter's snowtime.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother's Greek.
Be careful of your wishes.
Tom's a third-year student.
Who's coming with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
How it came, that's how it went.
Give him time.
Who's waiting, welcomes.
I'm gonna have to say yes.
We were never separated.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor thoroughly examined her.
At that point, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 per cent of the Norwegian population is supplied by drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
They're artificial tears.
Tom's very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
Try again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
It's said it's a new restaurant.
The price of this book is five dollars.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
The childhood sickness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is quite speculation, there will be evidence to support it in the future.
Keep it down there a little bit.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want some cheese.
That's not what you'd like.
I'm gonna have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Do you know Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you going to do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to protect moral and material interests that come from any scientific, literary or artistic work he is a creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands in the sea.
I've never had a problem sleeping.
Tom's hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Is there any other way?
The amount of work done and interest in invested capital were several millions.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't agree with you entirely.
It's a nice day.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday is seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Will you come to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in Southeast Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sappora.
The politician had sticky fingers because 5% of every contract ended in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he read.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hate us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't fight.
Did you write the report?
Tom wouldn't talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have a Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom's been working around nine hours continuously.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Everyone couldn't hear what Tom said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not his.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Dani give him money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It's a typical Gothian church.
It was a presentation to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do this.
Is this your notebook?
We kind of survived.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should re-test.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans gained leverage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I thought Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom kicked the flies out.
He suddenly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to deny what he said.
I have a cat and a dog, the cat is black, and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There's a cup on the table.
That makes me so angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Wouldn't you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish I had thought of that.
I'm drinking milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom's back safe.
I have no idea what happened in his head to refuse such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You've tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to go through with it.
Tom is strict but fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, how about you?
I mean to go abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I made a promise.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not a simple sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lesbian.
This is what it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like working.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, since he became a victim of the conspiracy, he was convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French sucks.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Smells.
Can you let Tom know I stopped by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned the French myself.
I like walking.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
One foot is in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy like electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your letter earlier.
Don't drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks quite different from what it was before.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbit ears big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to deal with things in a walk.
You're working too much.
This one's so cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I enjoyed it.
That's something you can trust.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of stuff.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Cade.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us so much.
What do you believe in?
Sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a government responsible, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried.
This river looks shallow, isn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this essay.
It's five in the morning in Brazil.
Tom suggested Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's so cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a very big secret.
Mary said she'd disclose the secrets of all her bosses unless they increase her salary.
That's not what you learn at school.
Is it clear?
I don't want to go out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two flowers.
Move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Well done!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom might be up to it.
I just want to get away.
Dania continued to follow Fadil's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day Bill goes fishing.
Don't let your chance get out of this good.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
He's in first year of law school.
I was looking for grape juice.
I've been thinking about my family.
The colourless green ideas sleep angryly.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Can I take your dictionary?
My liquid language knowledge is enough for many situations, but not for showing my, often mutually contradictional, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a teacher.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm tickled.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's strange the postman hasn't arrived yet.
Try doing one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
His novels are popular among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune has taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
Why?
A storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom's a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the Internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
As most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote a lot of musical work for the fagot.
Secretary of the United States John Carrie broke his right thigh in a bike accident Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of midwifes, they're skinny kids.
Tom's tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom seemed very confused.
The results were amazing.
Pick one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes are squeezed.
Have you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job was already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a slug.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop it?
Are you happy?
This is the stupidest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom couldn't speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by appearance.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
Tom's left side of the house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, known for its luxury dishes, this year will be something more modest.
Did you report to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long lookout, I ended up doing things randomly.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to me for dinner yesterday.
Look at the size of it!
It's the truth.
You're very rude.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're totally right.
He knows all his customers' names.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved in people he should never have mixed up with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write, and I'll write it.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I exaggerated.
The thermites eat a tree.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
You let me down.
There's no need to judge a man in his appearance.
That's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wasn't going to tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?
Kids are sleeping.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in england, has a rather long history.
Tom shut the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard, distributed a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
Phase one's over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even a surplus.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She's taking care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I've ever known.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pens today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Does French learn in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before he crossed the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's going to recover.
It is important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not being liked by anyone.
The brakes squeezed.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
It's just like beans.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to express the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow's gonna be a good time.
Maria's got a gig.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I give up.
Do your kids have rooms?
Tom saved all the letters Mary sent him.
Go swim with Tom for a little bit.
He's safe.
Tom died in a dream.
The female chiphoner is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the bathroom here?
Happy resurrection!
Tom helped me save some money by telling me about a cheaper place where it could be bought.
I owe you an apology.
There's nothing else you can do but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Die!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I truly so happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.
I had lunch in a hurry.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is a fortune.
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
For all I know, he never came in time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a rock.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
The wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure it's the pilot of Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer's faster than the stronger.
People used to write books to knock machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I acted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn how to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope not.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
You're wearing this.
How barbaric!
What day is tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.
When the cat's gone, the mouse's wheel of water.
We need this from Tom.
Japan rules the Emperor and the Spanish King.
It's Ali's book.
Are we going to see Tom again?
The world was a private edge of the nuclear war during the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis game.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie drinks milk.
Where did you see Tom?
Everything's quiet again.
I'm engaged.
Can we order, please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They laughed at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you set an example?
I don't intend to go to Busto with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom's drinking like a slug.
Like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That doesn't sound like you.
It's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like hard-headed people.
Sitting around all day is bad for you.
The rainy season starts in June.
You always do.
It's totally normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and bulletproof.
Do you hear anything?
He's got two cars.
Tom's probably still gonna be mad.
He said hello and left.
Welcome to Tatoeb.
I can't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We're close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced with robots.
Tom was totally drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
Who?
How many people live on Earth?
I'm a little worried now.
Come again anytime.
We're from Russia.
Have it your way.
Which I should do my free time.
We have to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last doughnut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
You don't speak English.
They shook hands.
They recognized Tom.
Tom was afraid of me earlier.
Anyone you meet is fighting a battle that you don't know anything about.
I'm afraid of death.
Don't run.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Tom's my big brother.
One man was arrested and accused of deliberate murder of 25-year-old Mary Thompson.
Come on, you two.
The film was inspired by the novel of the same title.
Peter loves Jane.
Is this a real diamond?
I don't want to be cruel.
Are you free tonight?
Do you have time to help me?
This is clear in itself.
Tom's furious.
Tom's gonna make sure he gets there in time.
Tom says I'm too aggressive.
What does that mean?
We'll never know the reason.
My favorite teacher was Jackson.
Tom's bored.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
I have to do what's right.
I like to watch you dance.
They replaced the coal with oil.
John came to Japan yesterday.
It was snowing.
We've already decided not to do that.
How can I say that in your tongue?
That's not a good sign.
He's a doctor, and he's also a writer.
It's hers, isn't it?

I don't live here.
I gave my mother nineteen flowers for Mother's day.
I hope you like it.
This card is worth a month.

Turns out the price was lower than I thought.
Some think that spontaneous burning people really happens, but I'm not so sure.
Who's going to read such a fat book?
It's good to see you again.
We'll visit you sometime.
I don't think so.

You taught us that.
Tom can't come to work today because he's not feeling well.
I'm a terrible writer.
We could accomplish what we started before.
They live in a white house with a fascinating brick on the left-hand corner at the end of the street.
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
It's too loud for me here.
I'm alone.
Why are you acting like this?
I'm really upset about that.
Tom's alone.
If she had been a little more patient, she could have done it.
Whatever you do, don't laugh.
Why don't you tell me what's really bothering you?
I don't understand why Tom would want to do that.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I'm not sure what time I need to be there.
Don't open it.

Mary makes a living sewing.

We won!
Tom ran in there.
Where's Tom going to sleep?
How does Tom do that?
All their efforts were in vain.
Did you sleep enough last night?
Tom asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with him.
The only word written on the page was "frog."
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Do you speak Italian?
It wasn't the only reason I left Mary.
"Do you have a nickname?" "Yes, Rick."
I stayed.
Tom ate a piece of pie.
Who told you to write with your left hand?
You should have told me.
Don't exaggerate.
I'm not doing anything today.
Really?
This is Brian Rock.
You can do better than that.
Tom's not an expert.
We came to London to see the comedy.
Why are you alone?

I have strong reasons to believe that my son Sérgio Melo today, May 11, 2014, registered to Tatoeba as 20,000 members!
I think that's absolutely great.
Tom was very scared.
I speak Bosnian.
Will we be there soon?
It's snowing.
I didn't recognize the tune.
I'm from Turkey.
Just tell me the truth.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I didn't speak French at the time.
I spent many nights clutching in bed watching TV.
The guard's outside.
Do you have any rooms?
May I call at 2:30 p.m.?
I'm really lucky about that.
Well, that's what happens.
That's a nice sweater.
I don't like Tom that much, actually.
I didn't really want to do that.
Tom didn't see anything.
You're stupid.
Tom looked a lot different after his haircut.
Tom invited Maria to dinner.
We're not staying here.
Interesting.
Music is, after silence, what the nearest shows inexplicable.
We walked all the way to the next station.
I have two daughters.
I really didn't have any money.
Tom kneeled to hide.
Have the courage.
Let's rest for five minutes.
I believe science.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Don't get complicated, Tom.
She smiled.
Just give us a chance.
Be careful.
Tom came out on stage.
Tom's getting on my nerves.
Take another one.

Seems most people are just flying the barbecue.
I shouldn't have said that.

This is not true.
I made the first step.
This is easy.
I know as much as you do.
They're scary.
They're just trying to help.
Tom told me he wanted to be a doctor.
I owe my father what I am.
Emily's English.
I asked him a lot of questions about ecology.
Why are you still awake?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
I thought you were going to the Boss bus.
We're going for a walk.
Can you keep a secret?
I thought you'd already taken care of that.
I remember everything.
Don't stop.
Tom's been shot three times.
Don't cheat.
You never know what can happen.
You do well to those who hate you.
I nod once.
Hello, how are you?
He doesn't speak English.
What's your favorite TV star?
Tom passed out.
How was your day?
He's not the kind of person who steals.

What's your job?
Tom hasn't written to me in a while.
Tom never told me what he wants to eat.
Could you read it?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Hello.
Tom's gonna make it.
Tom is living proof that you don't have to be smart to be successful.
Tom's a busy guy.
You look very pale.
This is a good textbook.
I've lost my mind.
Do you speak Italian?
Tom took out some ID.
You're embarrassing her.
My phone's about to go off.
Tom convinced Mary to invite John to the party.
Wait, what are you trying to do?
Let's stretch our legs.
I'm going on a trip.
That'll be all for now.
Interesting, he's coming today?
The powerless must be protected from the mighty.
I don't know if your languages are related.
I thought you'd be busy.
I want to rent a car, show me the pricebook, please.
How long has the turtle lived?
Haven't you done enough?
I'm very optimistic about this.
I think Tom was trying to impress me.
They show up here to enjoy the fountain with ice, beer and a picnic basket.

Tom was very sleepy.
This building will be built in the city.
Come closer.
Come!
What are you reading?

Don't go out tonight.
Don't get too tense!
Can you wake me up at 7:00 tomorrow morning?

This tea is good.
I miss you so much.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or yawning.
I'm ready.
I'm anti-war.
Walk.
He's got a nice patience on him.
Tom didn't give it to me.
Do you know how to deactivate the bomb?
I've tried that before.
You're my mother.
Italy is not Greece.
I'm just not so happy.

I will cooperate.
I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.
Give me an example.
It all played with the speed of light.
Fight!
That's really nice.
I've been called worse.
How did I miss that?
I'm not surprised at all.
I saved you a place next to me.
Looks like the victim tried to write the name of the killer with her own blood.
Being powerful is similar to being a lady, if you need to tell people that you are, then you're not.
Tom could have something to do with it.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
What's your story?
Where's Lori?
Were you in an accident?
I'll tell Tom if I don't forget.
I'm leaving.
I pissed him off.
That's very rare.
I pretended not to see.
I tried to be nice.
Can you ask her to call me?
I pretended not to see it.
Have you seen my dog?
It's getting dark.
Don't yell.
You know your rights.
You can't get in that room.
That's the point.
The whole town was underwater.
I didn't know where I came from.
I'm naked.
What do they call him?
Tom tried the button.
Can you add the salt?
I am ashamed that my son has done such a thing.
Success was only partial.
He always leaves for work at 8:00 in the morning.
I'm not 100% sure.
You want to bet?
That didn't like the look of his nose, so he did a nose surgery.

I didn't tell him you were here.
I have a gun.

We all live under the same sky, but we don't have the same horizon.
I can't imagine doing that.
My father has a good job.
He has a good memory.
Tom has a good mentor.
I came back today.
Here's a little secret.
How much money does he make a month?
What a stupid question!
I'm restless.
We protested peacefully.
Mary was as angry as Ris.
Get up and introduce yourself, please.
We're all eager to see the movie.
You have to solve your problems alone.
Where do you live, Tom?
Satisfied laughing.
Tom's got good notes.
That's not the reason for panicking.
I'm glad Tom won.
Tom was celebrating his prom anniversary last week.
I'll sit at the table there.
Why are you so good at explaining things?
Turn left.
Who's first?
Don't piss!
Your book is twice as big as mine.
My third husband bought me this.
I know as much as you do.
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
I'm thorough.
Let's take a look.
Tom writes something in the diary every night, however tired he is.
Have you planned anything special?
My parents died.
Most scientists believe that this is caused by human activity, through the release of methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas, since industrialisation time, but still, several other scientists doubt this.
Am I going to be replaced?
Earth is a planet.
I can resist anything but temptation.
All we have to do is practice.
I paid for it.
Louder, please.
I didn't say I did it.
They know you.
You were right to worry.
I wish you could watch my dog while I'm out.
I'm confused.
She has a good heart.
Did you bring a fan?
How much time do I have left?
Can you explain how to get to the airport?
I don't take the job.
I'm intrigued.
Does that happen often?
You can't rely on Tom.
You remind a little bit of Tom.
Everything's normal.
If you do.
Did you write the number?
You're under oath.
I fainted.
I wish I knew.
I haven't seen you here before.
I don't think so.
There's about 300 miles from here to Boston.
Tom asked me for more money than he really needed.
Tom only managed to save a little money.
I'll leave work early today.
Are you enjoying your work?
She was wearing a black hat.
Are you looking for something specific?
Her composition is very good, except a few mistakes in the excuse.
English is considered an international language.
Don't worry!
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
I'm a monk.
I live in Boston right now.
Ania has black, and Magdalena has blue hair.
What made you decide to stop using Twitter for?
I'm not a philologist.
Am I a suspect?
I could help.
Oh, my God!
Haven't you done enough?
All animals are equal.
I doubt Tom's going to give you the keys.
I didn't give anything.
I have a feeling it's going to rain.
Caroline's sad because she can't get pregnant.
He's got a few friends.
Did you sleep?
I don't want meat.
What are you hiding now?
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Tom seems a little blurred.
I am truly happy about that.
Drive faster.
I'm trying.
I have no idea what he's talking about.
That's certainly not a concern.
I took off my wig.
My life was good.
That's my cat.
There is a large amount of minor mistakes here and a small misunderstanding that distorts the meaning of the original sentence.
I've never had any complaints before.
I know how to ski.
He's standing there.
Are you afraid of rats?
I was at the front desk.
He's known as a great painter.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
Now you're lying to me.
Did Tom ever answer you?
Go find Tom.
Tom did his best.
Shoot in the legs!
"Are you serious?" "I'm totally serious."
Why are you mad at me?
I'd prefer a check-up in the morning.
That didn't like the way Mary talked to him.
We need to find out.
You're sad.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Tom has to learn more if he's thinking about finishing his class.
I've had enough fighting.
I wrote a song about what happened here last year.
I can't try it!
It's too easy that way.
Where'd that come from?
I'm not going to tell anyone that you did it.
Bears are very dangerous.
Really?
We know you're a coward.
I bought some books from the bookstore.
Last night we had to call the police.
I'm worried about you.
Have they ever had a car accident?
She's Prime Minister Finland.
Please come pick me up.
I like the way you made the apartment.
She decided not to go.
Tom traveled to the legendary Orient Express from Paris to Istanbul.
You're lying!
She's a fish.
Tom already knew about this.
I did it, didn't I?
No one noticed she was away until the meeting was over.
She's honest.
Who's running the meeting today?
How did you find out where Tom was?
You're not rational.
These are my best friends.
Don't go through that with me.
Give me a day or two.
She confessed everything.
Tom used to drive a bus earlier.
Would you like some coffee?
In the autumn many birds move south.
Forbidden fruit is always the sweetest.
That article was banged in English.
Some of you need help.
Sugar replaced the honey as a sweeter.
You're about to make a big mistake.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll leave.
What's all this mess about?
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
There's a bus stop near our school.
Don't drink water.
I was adopted.
No one knows what's going to happen next.
I've made my decision.
Do you have a copy?
Monday and Tuesday are the holidays.
We're going to the movies.
I don't understand why they're such good friends.
It's a linguist day.
I wouldn't hurt her.
This is a book.
In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he wrote it, he would already know that it would never appear in the press. I get my regular salary to keep my sincere opinion outside the newspapers that I do. Many of you are also paid similarly for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he thinks, he would be out on the street, looking for another job. If I let my right opinion appear only in one issue of newspapers I work for, I would get fired from work in less than 24 hours.
I'm not worried at all.
The bedroom's upstairs.
It's mine, it's not his.
I could use some help.
What's wrong with you?
I wasn't too surprised.
Tom couldn't get Mary to make a cake for John's birthday party.
Tom writes very well.
Tom froze himself.
I watched Tom die.
She hated him.
It's my favorite shirt, and I always wash it on my hands.
Somehow you gave me the feeling that you wanted me to invite you out.
It is recommended that you do not write your passwords where others can see them.
That's so funny.
Look again.
How could I do that?
Did you eat anything?
Tom's been very supportive.
It's expensive.
What are you gonna do today?
I'd rather not be involved in this phase, thank you.
It only happens occasionally.
I know your face.
This is the only place I can do.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
I'd like to tell you the truth.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
If you're going out, please close the door.
I can't believe I forgot.
Taxi is expensive.
Open up.
Do you love your mother?
I didn't know much about Australia.
Tom's going to recover.
There's no use trying to talk him into it.
That's true.
Let's be friends.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
You'll probably never see me again.
The dairy path is a huge belt of distant stars similar to our sun.
Who's that?
I could talk to Tom.
He lives around in the white house.
I thought you were happy here.
I thought Tom went well.
I could come with you.
I'm excited.
I invited him.
He's a man with great experience.
The beautiful blonde dried up on the beach.
Logic is obviously your strong side.
We're trying.
Fortunately, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
I need your help.
Stop!

I was just too busy.
The most beautiful flowers have the sharpest thorns.
What's this about?
I'd like to kiss you.
He owned many lands, once upon a time.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Tom laughed at the idea.
She was wearing intruding clothes.
I'll be right there.
He was terribly skinny.
I'm sorry.
What did she look like?
We can't go back.
He told me I was cute.
Colosseum was used until 217, but then lightning hit him and burned him.
My father's so old he can't work.
Ricky, this is my friend Suzuki.
How desperate are you?
It's time for you to go to sleep.
You're absolutely right.
I consider him the enemy.
You deserve it.
I'm working.
Does Tom have an attorney?
You changed my life.
Can I take your dictionary?
He ran away from her.
If a man has the right to life, then he should have the right to death.
All teachers were young and loved teaching.
Faith makes miracles!
He kept the air.
Tom's an acquaintance.
Congratulations!
The bird on the roof is crow.
My house is far away.
I've never really been anywhere.
We're in a difficult situation.
I'll check it out now.
Check again.
Come with us, please.
Sam's missing some board in the head.
You don't look so good.
What's the name of that restaurant?
How do I call a cab?
There's a lot of nice parks in London.
Tom kissed from anger.
I have a return ticket to Tokyo.
When did you get home?
They know you.
You didn't answer the question.
In this vocabulary, 1,000 words are written, and all of them must be remembered until July.
It's too loud for me here.
There's a good chance we'll win.
We have to go back.
Do you think it's possible to pass all the tests?
It would have been different.
They're all there.
Is that your car?
Did you bring a hairdresser?
He was naked chest and boson.
Did you talk about me?
Tom's going to drop out.
Does your head hurt?
I can ski.
Why do you think that?
It's snowing today.
You should write Tom a message.
I got a headache today.
She insisted that he go to the hospital.
I think Tom pulled out a fatter ending.
It doesn't play any role anymore.
I'll fix my homework tomorrow.
Get help.
Tom's suffering from chronic pain.
By the way, where do you live?
Tom installed solar panels on the roof of his house.
I want you to know if Tom and Mary are planning to be alone here.
He lives in England.
It's terrible down here.
Who wants to talk to me?
What a shock!
We tried to stop Tom.
Love and love is the greatest happiness.
Get the fuck out of here.
It's my fault.
Who wants to talk to me?
Get backup.
He was two years younger than me.
We just got here today.
Come stay with me.
Bring me her head.
I wasn't wearing an intruding clothes.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
When she was in Los Angeles, she had at least six different jobs.
You're embarrassing him.
Because of her physical deficiencies, Mary uses a walking cane when she's out there.
You can just tell us the truth.
The door offices are yellow.
I think Tom needs help.
I'm usually not in the office on Monday.
Dad, can you read me a story before I go to sleep?
Lemon contains lemon acid.
We'll never catch Tom.
I have a lot of friends.
Croatia was so beautiful.
I was tearing down the school.
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
We'll stop it.
Tom wants his money today.
Are you done washing dishes?
Can I use your dictionary?
Is it yours?
You told me that before.
Are you honest?
Tom didn't think Mary would have to do it.
Tom's a waiter, but he's looking for a better job.
The road is direct.
I need more coffee.
TV's not involved in the power.
The house is made of brick.
Everybody's lying.
Damn it, can you imagine how much they smelled?
Do you love your mother?
You should get a new car now.
I made the first step.
I'm down there.
Be tolerant.
What happens next time?
Would you like some fruit juice?
Tom's the best student in the class.
I assumed you were busy.
Go away.
Tom changed his name.
Can you help us?
I wasn't nervous about it.
Are you going back now?
My name is Hashimoto.
It's comfortable.
He lost hope and killed himself with poison.
You spyed on me.
It's night, dinner family.
Better late than never.
We're never going back there.
Are we going home?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him any money.
I was wrong this morning.
You can do better than that.
Is everything settled now?
Have you seen my dog?
Stay still.
One day he'll be mine.
I have a few friends.
Give Tom a drink.
I'm sick of it!
He went despite her disrespect.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
I feel a sharp stomach pain.
You must lie still.
That was scary.
Can I replace this?
They didn't know me.
What a beautiful car!
There are islands on the sea.
Are these bananas mature?
You're sad.
You're very rude.
I could kill you now.
Soldier woke Layla with a blow.
I know what you probably mean.
Tell me why you did it.
Can you take me to the airport tomorrow morning?
Please kick as hard as you can.
I won't let you do that.
I think I can save you some time.
Then I'll see what I can do!
Would you like some more tomato juice?
Maybe it's not enough.
That really liked his job.
Are you done?
I agreed to buy that.
Can you come?
Yes or no?
Speaking English is fun.
The postmortem showed that she was drowned.
Tom's going to die.
It's pronounced like this:
It was serious.
How was the French class?
Someone probably told him, but it wasn't me.
It's just unique.
No trouble, no science.
Stay positive.
The city was damaged during the war.
I pissed him off.
Give yourself some time.
Tom can't even write his own name yet.
Make yourself at home.
Thank you for the information.
What's your material status?
They need each other.
Was that who he was delusional?
Take it easy, but hurry up.
The rumor spread into the whole city.
Time flies.
He wants to see you some Mr. Itoh.
Cat's not human!
I'm doing a lot of things well.
I don't like to be surprised.
Come here.
You should eat more vegetables.
The best way to lose a kilo is to eat less and more exercise.
It's gonna be a fun weekend.
What's your name?
Tom's going to reconsider.
It wasn't too cold.
Tom wrote me over thirty messages yesterday.
I hope they don't notice my mistake.
I bought a cactus.
I'm a little worried now.
Now we need the truth.
The game is over.
Is that a bird?
Did breakfast be computed at the price?
Pick Tom up to go.
Is everything okay between us?
The ship's landed in the harbor.
Aren't you from Australia?
He raised a trophy high.
What can I say?
Tom was a big supporter.
We're finally here!
I'll be back soon.
He's afraid to get involved in paying large amounts.
She took off her clothes.
Tom loves Mary.
I killed God.
I could talk to Tom.
You're irrational.
Her name was unknown.
They've improved security checks, and they're prepared for the worst.
I found something, too.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
Do we have time?
Where's my room?
It's an investment advice.
My driving instructor says I should be more patient.
Pay in advance
I assumed you were busy.
The document came into the enemy's hands.
What kind of work are you looking for?
I want to drink.
I'm not that worried.
Why is that interesting?

You need a hobby.
I assumed you were busy.
At the next intersection, turn right.
I told you it didn't work.
You too, Brute?
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
I borrow books often from Tom.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well prepared in advance.
That's not what I'm counting on.
I don't know what that is.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
He's poor but too proud to ask for help.
"Who's in the car?" "Marie."
They gave water to their horses.
I went down to the wrong bus station.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls were wearing grass skirts and they had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?
The world is unfair.
Do you know she likes animals?
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
He might already have gone.
He started yelling.
Don't be rude to me!
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure the table for cross budgets, insert and use plain tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll be staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Come to my house.
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What happens next time?
Mr. Wood came to the door and talked to Tony's mother.
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
He doesn't speak French at all.
We watched the bird feed her young.
The detectives are still investigating.
Tom was sophisticated.
This sad story was written at the time Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
She drinks like a fish.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis game.
Do you have anything to say?
Change your clothes.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
He's dressed like a woman.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You shouldn't send that email.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you were abandoned by your husband?
Can you prove that?
It's a dead end.
It's easy to write this pen.
Tom called his hamster Cookie.
Are you ready for more?
Don't change your mind so often.
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me dance?
I don't like learning in this heat.
I'd rather not be involved in this at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
There's nothing to do in this village.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play the guitar before.
He's a man of experience.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what both of them like.
Must have been terrible.
Your plan sounds great.
You sound amazed.
I'll lend you a paperwork if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where can we meet tomorrow?
The house is in his possession.
Tom saved Mary.
What do we want to learn a few languages?
Tom's deaf as a cannon.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
"Have you seen my phone?" "It's on the table."
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
Stiglitch is a very interesting bird.
There's no point waiting.
The connection between a person and a blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
The cat came out under the table.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
Your house is big.
If you spend a lot of time in there, you can practice as high as you can as you walk or walk in a place.
You're all for me.
I want to get married.
Hold my backpack.
I've checked some things.
Tom knew Maria didn't like him.
I'm not singing.
It was love at first sight.
I'd love to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Will you be here soon?
Many young Romans have gone to Greece.
The plan was dismissed as unpracticable.
I don't want to go to school.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
A working group dealing with data transfer led by Ben Manni will hold a meeting on January 14, 1999.
Some say if you step on a rainbow, it'll start to rain.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
I have to go to the mosque.
I mean, so I did.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
He used to talk to young women on his own.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Don't push yourself!
Tom can knock very quickly.
I can't answer you right now.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
I want a sword like this!
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
Tom still seems surprised.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't just give up.
He soon recovered from shock.
I'll give you what you want.
It's pure escapism.
Who did you write the letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Karin is Austrian.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
You're sad.
Tom bought some newspapers and read them on the train.
Focus your camera on the flower.
I won't be home next week.
When I was a kid, I often visited him on Sundays.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
Welcome back.
How does Tom know the French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no policy established.
Write down what I say.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
The redheads are driving me crazy!
Do you love your mother?
He finally fulfilled my request.
It was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they give you a reason?
Can you spell me your name?
Look at this.
I have an aunt who lives in Kyoto.
She was saving a living head.
What wine do you have?
Do you think she did it?
I think we should call a doctor.
Life in Tokyo is very expensive.
You're so early today.
We got Tom in action.
We should be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
I think this is obvious.
Emma was very inspiring at the party.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Tom asked Mary how she liked the new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Could you hand me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
The terrorists freed the hostages.
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like her at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
Tom asked Maria if he could borrow her English textbook.
We're here for you.
Call security!
My scarf is blue.
The land is too small.
I'm intrigued.
What do you believe?
What do you want?
The drugs mostly don't have to be mixed with alcohol.
The bakery's right next to the butcher's.
Did you see who that was?
Try this.
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people no matter what age they are, don't lose their beauty.
Tom adopted a Russian sentence.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's quite extraordinary.
Tom got off his shoulders.
Bad things are going to happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Explore her.
I'm very impressed.
She was dressed in red.
I should talk to my father about it.
What does a Sovietologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Where's the dog?
Have you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
All right, how about you?
We're the same soy.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope loses when you experience a difficult situation and a pointless brake.
I laughed.
You have to stop smoking.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.

You better shut up!
Tom and Mary decided to adopt John.
The baby's asleep.
Did you eat anything?
Tom is in no danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
He's not a kid anymore.
We're almost done.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
My friend was shocked when I told her.
I think Tom could do it.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really that individual?
I asked Tony a question.
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning up the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
Tom came to Mary's birthday party.
What's your specialization?
He couldn't have laughed at her jokes.
She liberated the bird from the cage.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You are the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I wasn't too surprised.
I saw him pull something out of the box like a pot.
What's your name in Bosnian?
Do you know how this machine works?
Tom managed to find a job in Boston.

Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's beautiful.
I don't really watch TV.
I love France.
He's good.
Did you know that?
I think so, too.
Are you ready?
The money's talking.
He's my rival in business.
I prefer a tent with a storm blanket, along with crossed rods because of wind stability and snowy nanosis, and this has to be a double layer tent.
Tell Tom I'm saying hello.
That's very sensitive.
This is my wife Edith.
I can't be something I'm not.
She lost her money, her family, her friends.
Now introduce yourself using these sentences!
My name is not you; it's Ricardo.
Where do we meet?
We need to consider all options.
I hope this never happens again.
It's very likely it's raining tomorrow.
You're driving me crazy.
You don't need my permission.
I remember everything.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
It has a nice flower, but it doesn't produce fruit.
I'm touched.
Tom told me to knock on the door.
Tom's been fired.
Do you plan on going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is considerably better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Who bought you this?
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor is interrogating a patient.
Tom passed his drink.

Let's hope you're right.
We split up on a corner.
Are you angry about that?
I baked my tongue.
You've tried.
I thought I could rely on Tom.
Winds!
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that fall out to me?
No one died.
Have you been sleeping?
I'm deaf and not alone while I eat.
They tried hard in court.
My name is Sally.
I'm not practicing.
Is there a reason why you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
I have to go now.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric's not from India, is it?
Who are you?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Don't yell at me.
They spoke uglyly about the captain when he was gone.

Yeah.
I love this store.
I'm about to start looking for you.
He leads a turbulent life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
I've lost my mind.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom has the right attitude.

Where did you get the keys?
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little blurred.
I saw the bus.
It's not a big deal.
Tom's wise enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports to give you a closer look at them.
I'm not both as rich as we'd like.
Can I kiss you?
Get on board.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.

What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
When exactly did you do that?
Someone probably told her, but it wasn't me.

Why are you leaving?

Give me the milk.
I just want to go home.

Have you seen my dog?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually eat?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he wrote it, he would have known in advance that it would never appear in the press. I received my regular salary to keep my sincere opinion outside the newspapers I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any one of you who would be so crazy to write what he thinks, would find himself outside, on the street, looking for some other business. That I let my opinion appear only in one issue of newspapers that I do, I would get quit from work for less than 24 hours....
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said would happen.

By what name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been?
She smiled.
You told me you wouldn't be here today.

This book is suhoparous.
She came alone.

I could go there now.
Everyone was cheering.

Let me sit down.
This is Kopakabana!

I'm learning a few languages.

You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
Do you have any idea about my life?
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
The code is Muriel.
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't even think he'd try to convince Mary to do it for a second.
Don't argue with me.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things are going to happen.
A few people were killed.

Who is this man?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
He likes to make a mosquito ass.
I totally disagree with that.
The boy is thin.
It's a routine thing.
He never got over the death of a son.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
There's nothing going behind my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my children.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it was too small.
Of course, Tom's wrong.
I didn't wash my hair.
I can keep my eyes closed.
He has to buy his son a new bike.
My dear, don't be shy!
Are you afraid of death?
Are you hungry?
Tom's still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
It was a false alarm.
Tom's learning how to program.
Anyone can get the wax.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
What did you say?
I don't know the answer.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
This commercial is very offensive.
I want Tom to leave by noon.
Tom seemed amazed.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
Nancy's scared of dogs.
It won't help if you worry.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
The cat is not human!
So this is how it ends?
What's this?
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He sleeps like a baby.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
That's not what I like.
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to the Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you!
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I wish I knew what was going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had a problem sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I'm not going to try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's account.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
Magdalene is interested in the geography.
"Do you know what's going on?" - "No. What's the matter?"
That's what both of them like.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
There's no reason to be scared.
Turn around.
The pen I'm writing belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
Just close your eyes.
Mary lost the key.
It's time.
