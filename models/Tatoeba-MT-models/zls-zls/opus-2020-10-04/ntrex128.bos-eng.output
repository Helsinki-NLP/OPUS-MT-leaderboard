Welsh members of the congregation are concerned about similarity with "Mapetovci"
Some members of the congregation are overly irritated by the proposal to change their title into "Welsh Parliament members" (MWP).
This came about plans to change the name of the congregation to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned that this could become a mockery.
A labor member of the congregation said that his group is concerned "because it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: Welsh Twp means silly, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Parliament of the Political Party, Plaid, said that the group is "not fully satisfied" and proposed alternative names.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was "opened" on a name change, but noted that there was a small difference between MWP and Mapetovac concepts.
In this context, the excuse of the Welsh letter w is similar to the excuse of the letter in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Commission, currently working on a draft law on the introduction of a name change, said: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of members of the assembly will, of course, be made by members themselves."
In 2017, the Velsa government law gave the congregation the authority to change the name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public debate on proposals that resulted in a major support for the appointment of the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the Assembly, the Commission gave the title of members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support in the public debate.
The members of the assembly are supposed to make alternative proposals, but efforts to achieve a consensus could give headaches to the chairman of Elina Jones, who is expected to submit a draft amendment law within a few weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes on how the congregation works, including rules on disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Commission's system plan.
The members of the congregation will have the last chance to vote on their name when they discuss the law.
Macedonians go to a referendum on the country's name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The national vote was organised in an effort to resolve a decade dispute with a neighbouring Greece that has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting that their northern neighbour's name represents its sloppy territory and persistently opposes its EU and NATO pact requirements.
Macedonian President Đorđe Ivanov, opponent of plebiscites on the name change, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, voter supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe the change of the name is simply the price they must pay for EU membership and NATO pact.
The bells on St. Martin shut up while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to say that once on every corner there were bars and churches," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the others are here today."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are hanging out differently today," he said.
"The bars are no longer quarterly living rooms that people go to regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the managers expect, "and sooner or later, they will return to where they started."
The church, he added, could be replaced by housing buildings with apartments full of people who will not help preserve the remaining quarterly sanctuary.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings will be white people," he said, "and that is why they will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white communities before Harlem became a black Metropolitan Metropolitan community in 1870 and St. Martin's Church ten years later.
The original community of white methodists moved out in the 1930s.
The black community who worshipped nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's church was taken over by the black community under the lead of Reverend John Howard John Johnson, who led the boycott of traders on 125th Street, the main trade street in Harlem, who opposed employment or promotion of black people.
In 1939, the fire damaged the building, but as the priests of Father Johnson made a plan for reconstruction, they ordered the organs.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his heir in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "poor bells."
The expert who played the organ in July called them differently: "cultural treasure" and "independable historical instrument."
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first organs in the world played by black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to greater organs in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin's Church didn't find a replacement for him.
What happened in St. Martin's Church has been a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of which brought church heads and other bishops.
The bishop administration – the administrative body of the bishops, composed of church heads – wrote to the bishop in July expressing concern that the bishop "will endeavor to transfer expenses" to the bishop administration, although the bishop's administration was not included in the lease of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the bishop.
The shark hurt a 13-year-old during lobster hunt in California
The shark attacked and hurt a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California on the day of the lobster opening, officials said.
The attack happened sometime before seven o'clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday he dive with his friends about half an hour when he heard the boy who called for help and then took him to him along with the group and helped to get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement for lobster capture, but then "he realized he was yelling "She bit me!"
She's got me!
The whole key bone was torn apart," Hammel said he noticed when he got to the boy.
"I have called on everyone to come out of the water: 'The shark is in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported by a helicopter to the paediatric hospital Rady's where his condition is being handled as critical.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Savior Captain Larry Giles said in addressing the media that the shark was already spotted in that area several weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim received traumatic injuries in the upper part of the hull.
Officials closed the beach access from the Ponto Beach beach in Casablad to Swami's beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the beauty market in Britain
Sainsbury's becoming competition with chains Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams to cosmetic products in the style of goods houses in which professional assistants work.
As part of a significant penetration on the beauty market in Britain worth 2.8 billion pounds, which is increased as the sale of fashion and household equipment is decreasing, larger cosmetic departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be extended to several stores next year if successful.
Investments in cosmetic products occur because supermarkets find ways to use the shelves used once for televisions, microwaves and domestic equipment.
Sainsbury's said he would double his cosmetic asortiman by offering more than 3000 products, including brand products such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brand products L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space in departments similar to those in stores like Boots.
Supermarket will also restart its line of makeup Boutique by making most of the products suitable for vegans – something that younger customers are increasingly looking for.
In addition, Fragrant Shop's parfem store will test the two Sainsbury's stores, first opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the other will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and moving towards daily purchase of small amounts of food in local shops means supermarkets must make additional efforts to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of the chain of Sainsbury's, said the stores would look more like supermarkets in the attempts to counter the chains with large discounts of Alda and Lidl, with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opened departments of the Argos store in hundreds of its shops, and also introduced Habitat departments since they bought both chains two years ago, which says it increased sales of food products and profitability.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to modernise its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments ended unfamous.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended with a quarrel over the division of income from pharmacy in their shops.
The new strategy entered into force after Sainsbury's three years ago sold his 281 pharmacy to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds was said to play a role in this plan by adding an additional line of luxury for skin care to four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of the chain of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and experience of our beauty departments in order to provide our customers a more pleasant environment.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be at hand to provide advice.
Our asortiman of brands is designed to satisfy all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an indispensable destination for the market of beauty that sets new standards compared to the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "dire" after Holly Willoughby retired from an agreement worth 11 million pounds
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "dire" after TV leader Holly Willoughby withdraws from an agreement with his personal brand worth 11 million pounds to focus on its contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for his brand home and additional equipment Truly.
The company of this pair is compared to the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The Emission Manager This Morning (37) announced its departure through Instagram.
Holly WIlloughby pissed off the Dragons' Den Peter Jones' star by pulling out of their profitable brand at the last minute – to focus on her new entering contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was "bearing" when a golden girl of television confessed, during an intense meeting Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, in Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to 1.5 million pounds, meant that there is no time to dedicate their brand of home and additional equipment to Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow Goop and it was predicted to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced her departure on Instagram, Jones flew from Britain into one of his weekends.
The source said, "Holly put Truly in the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan that would provide her earnings over the next few decades.
Her decision to retire was all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launching.
There's a lot of products in Marlowe's headquarters ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the head of the show This Morning, which among the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions because of huge investment in broad product asortiment, from pillows and candles to clothing and household equipment, and possible further delays in launch dates.
And it could mean an end to long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tari Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cappov in 2016, and Jones (52) joined in March as CEO of the company.
The couples go on vacation together and Jones has 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's production house.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the brand M&S and will replace Anto McPartlin as the leader in the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
The source close to Jones last night said, "We wouldn't comment on his business."
Tough words, “and then we fell in love ”
He joked about criticisms he could get from the media for comments that could be characterised as "unprecedent" and for a positive stance on the northern Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so much?
Trump said his funny voice "reader of the news."
"I didn't give in at all."
He pointed out that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump declared their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step forward towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, High North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders and UN General Assembly Saturday that North Korea did not see "adequate response" by the US to the original steps of North Korea towards disarmament.
Instead, he pointed out, the United States continues to sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump gave a much more positive opinion during his speech at the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were a step away from war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we have great relations."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results -- by suspending missile tests, liberating hostages and returning the remains of the US soldiers.
And he stood up defending his unusual approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It's easy to act presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this full arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of it.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island by killing hundreds
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that their assistance is not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of the island of Lombok has been relocated, the state of national disaster has not been declared, a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it will be quite difficult," Mrs Sumbung said.
While the organization Save the Children is putting together a team that will travel to Pala, they are still not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials assess the situation on the island of Pala to see if they should allow international agencies to participate in helping.
With the constant earthquake in Indonesia, it is sad to see how unwilling this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters for tsunami are built in Aceh, they are not often seen on other parts of the coast.
Apparently there was no tsunami siren on the island of Pala, even though the warning was in force, so it also contributed to the loss of life.
And in ideal conditions, travel between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship accumulated in Lombok to help victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pala, but it will take him at least three days to get to the scene of a new accident.
President Joko Widododo focused on improving Indonesia's enduring infrastructure and not saving money on roads and railroads.
However, the lack of funding hit Mr. Joko's administration as he expects new elections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also under pressure because of long-term sectatic tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and dozens of thousands were displaced because of the street fights of Christian and Muslim groups, who used machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look: Leverpoola Footballer Daniel Sturridge has put a deep matching shot against Chelsea football club
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from loss at the Premier League hit in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge stadium in London.
Sturridge received a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri on about 30 yards from Chelsea's naked club while his team was losing 1:0.
He switched the ball to his left and then kicked to the outer stave.
The ball flew high above the criminal space turning to the upper right corner of the net.
In the end, she fell over the Cape Arrizabalg who was jumping and falling into the net.
"It was only up to positioning, to receiving the ball, and players like Shaq always go forward as far as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time," Sturrudge said for LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the Cante coming, I touched her once, and I didn't think much, I just hit the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 in half after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a 25-minute hit.
The blue attacker added the 5th ball to Mate Kovacic before running from the middle of the field to Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly touched and brought the ball back in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful cross, leading Hazard to criminal space.
Hazard was faster than defense, and he ended up close to the statue, putting into the net by the left leg of Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli at the group phase of the Championship League in three hours Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea plays against Videoton at the League of Europe at three o'clock Thursday in London.
The number of victims of Indonesian tsunami reached 832
The number of victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami have risen to 832, the state disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported in the ruins of buildings that collapsed the 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and raised waves high and up to 20 feet, the spokesman of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a man (32) after a woman was stabbed fatally
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead this morning in the Merseyside area.
Forty-four-year-old girl found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 30-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called the people nearby who saw or heard something to answer.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is early, but I'm calling everyone near John Street in Birkenhead and who have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have taken some cameras on the car control panels, to contact us because they may have information that is important for the investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed the woman whose body was found from Birkenhead and found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman have arrived on the spot to question where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and the police said that the family of the victim is in the process of informing.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police informed him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He ran out of text when he found out what happened.
The tenants are now told that they will have to wait for hours before they are allowed to go back inside.
They heard a cop tell a man that the whole zone was considered a crime scene.
One woman came to the crime scene in tears.
She said, "This is so terrible."
At 14 o'clock, two police vans were inside the police cordon, and another van right next to it.
Most police officers were inside the police Cordon by overseeing the housing building.
All who have any information have been called to contact @MerPolCC directly, call 101 or anonymously contact the Criplaceppers line on 0800 555 111 citing the case 247 since September 30th.
The statue of Cromwell in parliament became the latest monument in the midst of arguing about "the revision of history"
Her removal would represent poetic justice for the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts in England performed by his puritane followers in the Taliban manner.
But the company of Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick as "sancy" and "Try revision of history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the context of the current discussion on the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace in Westminster became a target.
Cromwell didn't even order or carry out iconism during the English civil wars.
The wrong Cromwell could be sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas from the previous century.
The magnificent display of Cromwell's author Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is evidence of an opinion from the 19th century and part of the history of a character that many believe should be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said about The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwella many consider, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to protect Parliament from external pressure, in his case of monarchy.
Is this entirely the subject of permanent historic debate.
What is certain is that the conflict from the middle of the 17th century has formed a further development of our nation and that Cromwell is a recognizable character that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the capacity of Lord Protector are also worthy of glory and remembrance."
The killer's pig caused death injuries to a Chinese farmer.
A pig attacked and killed a farmer at the southwest China market, local media reported.
A man, only known his name was Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood in a pork in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou district, reported South China Morning Post on Sunday.
Pig was preparing for pigs to inject vaccines in pork on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai, China.
He reportedly arrived with a cousin from the neighbouring area of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door of the next pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the pig with blood around his mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a scumbag weighed 550 libers inflicted fatal injuries to a farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and torn apart," Guiyang Evening News quoted his cousin as saying.
The security camera record shows Yuan who came to the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man was not Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked in order to prevent attacking other people while the police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market owners are supposed to negotiate damage for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks on people have been reported before.
The pig attacked her wife and her husband in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to a man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 libers kissed a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife scared and chased her away.
After the pigs ate an oregonian farmer in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "kiss trigger".
"They're just playing.
They like stitches, they're very curious... they have no intention of hurting you.
You just have to respect them enough," he said.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane bring widespread showers to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the hurricane of Rosa has weakened by moving above the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring floods due to the rains across northern Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rose's winds of the first category hurricane reached a speed of 85 miles per hour of five hours in the eastern time on Sunday, with 385 miles southwest from Punt Eugenia's town in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the gap is formed in the Pacific Ocean and moves to the east and west coast of the United States. As the tropical storm Rosa approaches Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will start pushing tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture along with the coming gap will create widespread showers in the southwest in the next days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will result in floods, nanosis and possible slides in the desert.
High tropical moisture will result in drops that will reach locally 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in the southwest regions, especially in most of Arizona.
Floods are possible as a result of the sudden deterioration of weather conditions and typical tears of tropical rain.
Excursions in the desert would be extremely reckless with the danger of tropical rain.
The abundant rain in the canyons could result in wild rivers, and thunderstorms in place with strong winds and sandstorms.
The coming me will bring local showers on the parts of the coast of Southern California.
The total drops of over half an inch are possible, which could cause nanosis and slides in August.
This will be the first rain of the damp season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers will arrive at Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain gets wider later on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
In October, there can be major fluctuations across the United States that the Arctic is getting colder and the trops remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
There is an excellent example of dramatic differences in the temperature in the central United States on Sunday.
The difference in the temperatures in Kansas City, Missouri and Omahi, Nebraska and between St Louis and Des Moins, Iowa, was almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the remains of summer heat will try to rebuild and expand.
The beginning of October will be warm in most central and eastern parts of the United States with temperatures of approximately 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
The temperature in New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term weather forecast announces a high possibility of temperature above the average in the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the high court and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual harassment allegedly in 1980, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political refusal continues, with broadcasters interrupting regular broadcasts due to the latest complication Friday: a deal Senator Arizona Jeff Blake made with the FBI agency on a weekly investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Commission that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh was touching and trying to break up at a high school party.
In a passionate confession, Kavanaugh said it was 100% certain that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, this was probably over 20.4 million people watched on Friday.
The company computerised CBS channel viewers, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks emitting it, including PBS channels, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty picking up people who are tracking the transfer from the office.
To get better, it's an audience similar to the one that monitors football elimination matches or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose editors supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led ahead of other networks with an average number of viewers of 5.69 million during the whole day's hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million, Nielsen said.
Interesting is high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character of the drama on Friday.
After the office of a moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded footage of protesters screaming at him after he tried to enter the elevator to attend the hearing of the judicial committee.
He stood down with a down view for a few minutes while he was offended, with a live transmission on CNN.
"I stand here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed, he had more to say in the commission hearing.
The cable and television networks had live broadcasts hours later while the judicial committee voted whether to forward the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do it on condition that the FBI investigates the charges set up next week, which a minority of Democrats is calling for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few more senators after that, Flake decided.
Flake's choice was significant because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of Britain and to undermine national interests in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, 29 September 2018.
In a second interview on the cover of her journal, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU take customs one of the other "very absurd".
The murder of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting that killed Wayde Sims, twenty-year-old basketball player of the LSU club.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and incarcerated on charges of second-step murder, police administration Baton Rouge said.
Officials posted a video of a fight between Simps and Simpson and the police said Simpson lost his glasses during the fight.
The police took the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, report the WAFB network CBS channel.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he confessed to killing Wayde.
His bail is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
The coronership of the eastern area of Baton Rougea issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a shot from a gun to the head and neck.
The department said credit belonged to the police work group for the fugitives of Louisiana, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police and the residents of the area that helped during the investigation that led to arrest.
The Sports Director of the LSU Club, Joe Alleva, thanked the district agency for implementing the law on "feeling and pursuit of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
An attacker 6 feet and 6 inches grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne was also a basketball player at the LSU club.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per match.
Friday morning, the basketball coach of the LSU Will Wade Club said the team was "scared" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
"This is what we worry about all the time," Wade said.
Vulcan casts ashes in Mexico City
The ash floating the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Centre for Disaster Protection warned the Mexicans on Sunday to stay safe after volcanic activity in the crater increased and after 183 emissions and ashes were registered in 24 hours.
The center was tracking more earthquakes and kicks.
Pictures in social media show a thin layer of ash that covers windscreen cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophisians have noticed an increased volcano activity located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital since the 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police confront Catalon Separatists Ahead of Anniversary of Independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Sunday after protesters, supporters of independence, confronted a special police squad, when thousands of people joined counterdemonstrations to mark the anniversary of a polarising catalonic referendum on separation.
A group of masked separatists, detained by a special police squad, fired them with eggs and colours in powder, making dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Later in the day, the conflicts with the police used the bandages to suppress the fight.
Independence supporters have scanned "No forgettings, no forgiveness" for hours and confronted Union supporters who shouted "Heavy Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries gained in protests, local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region that has set for independence a year after the first October referendum that Madrid declared illegal, but what catalonic separatists celebrated.
The voters chose largely independence, although the turnout was low because the opponents boycotted the referendum by separation.
According to Catalon authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the violent conflicts across the region.
Groups advocating independence camped Friday night to prevent demonstrations and support national police.
The demonstrations were still held, but they changed their march.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in separatist protests with his wife, said he is no longer optimistic about catalon independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they were allowed to vote, but we are now in trouble," he said.
While they took a key, but close victory in the local elections last December, the catalonic parties who advocate independence have had difficulty maintaining the momentum because some of their most famous leaders are in self-involved exile or in detention, expecting a trial for their role in the organisation of a referendum, and then declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old automechanic who filmed a police support protest on the phone, said politicians on both sides were arguing the conflict.
"It's getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalon leaders who has been detained since the end of last year, announced his candidacy in the European Parliament elections next year.
"The run in the European elections is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and repressions imposed by the Spanish authorities," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving a car into the house
Three men (33, 34 and 39) were arrested after repeatedly stumbled in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent Street Thursday around 19:30 in British weather.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings said the gate was damaged as well as the building itself.
There's a possibility that at one point the car was shot from the crossbow.
Menge's hit with Livingstone won 1:0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menge's first goal is to win Livingston.
The promotional Livingston surprised the Rangers and only recorded a second loss for Steven Gerrard in the 18 Ibrox club matches.
The goal of Dolly Menge was key, while Gary Holt's club was equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's club didn't record any guest victory at the Premier League this season and will play against the first-played Hearts, which will be eight points behind next week.
Before that, Rapid from Vienna will host Rapid at the European League match on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended a series of victories in the league to six matches, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed opportunities against guests who lacked sharpness
Holt's team was supposed to be in leadership long before they scored a goal because their direct game was very troubled for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but his attempt went by naked, then Alan Lithgrow went by naked after sliding in order to receive the ball that Craig Halkett transferred his head to naked.
The hosts answered to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could create problems for guests from free blows.
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
There was a free blow against the Rangers, Livingston made a passage, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created an opportunity for Manga, who received the ball and hit from the middle of the criminal space.
By that moment, the Rangers dominated in possession of the ball, but the host defense remained bulletproof and the goaler Liam Kelly had not had much problems.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Kelly had to intervene because of Alfred Morelos.
Scott Pittman stopped the foot of the naked Rangers of Allan McGregor, and Lithgow kicked too wide from another free shot for Livingston.
The crosses stepped to Livingston's criminal space and were constantly defended, while the two pens they were looking for – one after the foul against the replacement player Glenn Middleton, and the others because of the game with their hand – were not assigned.
"Fenomenal Game" Livingston – Analysis
Reporter BBC Scotland, Alasdair Lamont is in Tony Macaraona arena
Fenomenal game and results of Livingston.
They were all excellent and continued to exceed expectations in the eastern path.
Their style of game and players have almost changed since their return to the top, but great credit belongs to Holt who gives energy to the team since they arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great, leading an excellent organised defense, while Menga gave the whole match to Connor Goldson and Joe Worral.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard's bat from time to time, they didn't reach that level.
The final impacts were lacked – only once they broke through the host lines – and this is the kind of call to wake up for the Rangers located in the middle of the table.
A mixed reception for Erdogan in Keln
Saturday (September 29th) was a sign of a smile and a blue sky while Turkish and Germany leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at repairing NATO's allies.
They dispersed on issues like human rights, freedoms of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Keln to open a huge new mosque.
This is the city where the largest number of Turks live outside of Turkey.
The police cited security measures as a reason to block the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who oppose Erdogan -- many of them Kurds -- were also loud, condemning Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Double protests reflect the divide in the views of a guest celebrated by some German Turks as heroes, while others resent him as autocracy.
Traffic accident in Deptford: Bicyclist died in a car crash
The bicyclist died in a car crash in London.
There was a collision near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford, southeast of town, around 10:15 per British time.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance team intervened, but a man died on the spot.
The crash happened several months after the other bicycle was killed in a crash where the driver left the scene of the accident, on Childers Street, which was about a mile away from the site of the Saturday crash.
The London police said they were working on identifying the victim and informing the family.
The streets are closed, the buses are redirected, and the drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in high-security prisons for men, the prison Office said.
The riots broke out in Long Lartin, the area of Worcestershire, Sunday around 9:30 in British time and still last.
A special task force of officers of Tornado has been invited to calm down the riots in which eight protectors participate in one prison wing.
Officials gained minor injuries, and help was provided at the scene
The prison administration spokesman said, "We have arranged a specially trained prison staff dealing with an incident in the Long Lartin prison.
Six members of the staff got medical attention for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we made it clear that the responsible will be forwarded to the police and they could be extended to prison sentences."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was said that the prison manager was received to hospital treatment after he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, a special squad was called to prison for serious riots in which the staff was attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to flood Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Late City (which can be useful in areas caught with drought)
Rarely when tropical depressions hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen in the beginning of next week while the hurricane of Rosa passes through the desert southwest regions, taking the risk of flooding.
National meteorological administration has already issued warnings for floods Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona and South and Eastern Nevada, Southern California and Utah, including towns Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, and its approach will announce rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Administration in Phoenix stated in the tweet that only "ten tropical ciclons have kept the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles around Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane that was 40 miles from the border of Arizona."
The latest projections of the National Hurricane Centre envision 2 to 4 inches of rainfalls, and in the isolated parts of Mogolon Rome in Arizona and up to 6 inches.
In other parts of the desert southwest, including the central part of Rockies chain and Great Basin, it will most likely be 1 to 2 inches, and possibly up to 4 inches in isolated parts.
In parts where there are no fears of floods, Rose's rain could be a blessing because the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, one part of these rainfalls will probably be useful because the southwest is currently affected by drought.
According to the US Surveillance Agency, fewer than 40 per cent of Arizona was affected at least by extreme drought, second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, on his way, the Rosa Hurricane will lead to a slide in the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, who will still have a hurricane of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, will be 385 miles south of Punt Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will reach the colder waters of the Pacific and therefore begin to nurture.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico by the power of the tropical storm on Monday afternoon or at night.
The showers in the parts of Mexico could be very strong and could be a huge risk of flooding.
"The total drops from three to six inches are expected from Baja California to Northwest Sonore, and perhaps even to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north through Mexico by power of the tropical storm before reaching Arizona early Tuesday morning in the form of tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and South Utah on Tuesday late evening.
"The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remnants is large rains in Baja California, Northwest Sonora and the US Southwest Desert," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rainfalls are expected to cause stormy floods dangerous for life and landscape in the deserts, as well as slides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four persons arrested for attempting murder
Three teenagers and twenty-year-old men were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Summerset.
Teenagers found injured near Excelsior Terrace Street in Midsomer Norton on Saturday about 4 hours in the morning of British time.
He was taken to the hospital, and he's in stable condition.
Seventeen-year-old, two eighteen-year-olds and twenty-year-olds were arrested in the Radstock area, police said Avon and Summerset.
Officials are calling for those who have any video of the events on the cell phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "Treated Underground and Anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the cruel and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Whelling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "treated the subtleness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's claims that he sexually assaulted several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her accusations.
On Saturday, the president said the Americans saw the glow, the quality, and the courage of Cavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most realistic legal minds of our time, a lawyer with great achievements in public service," the group of supporters in West Virginia said.
The president directly touched the appointments of Kavanaugh while talking about the importance of the turnout of the Republicans in the middle of the term of office.
"Five weeks of the most important choices of our lives.
Although I'm not running myself, I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I fight all over for great candidates."
Trump claims the Democrats are trying to "provide resistance and disrupt".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected not later than Friday, said the High Representative of the Republican Party for CNN.
Hundreds have lost their lives in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to increase
At least 384 people died, many of them picked up by huge waves that hit the beaches, when the big earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulawesi, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered because of the beach festival in Pala on Friday when waves up to six meters (18 feet) hit the shore at sunset, bringing many to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
Tsunami followed a 7.5 earthquake.
"When the danger of tsunami was announced yesterday, people were still dealing with their beach business and did not immediately escape, and they were killed," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster sanitation agency, addressing Jakarta.
"Cunami was not coming alone, carrying cars, bulbs, houses, hit everyone on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that tsunami traveled across an open sea at 800km per hour (497 miles an hour) before he hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in the city of Palo.
Photos from the air, issued by the catastrophe agency, show a lot of destroyed buildings and shops, bended and demolished bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The tremors continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes hit the area in which 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy of a massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times higher than the force of an atomic bomb hurled into Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical position of the city located on the edge of the long, narrow bay has increased the power of tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "abundant" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, store centers and hotels have been demolished.
Bodies of several victims were found under the ruins of demolished buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, in the Dongalo region, near the earthquake epicenter.
Communications "have been completely cut off without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to endangered areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get even worse," they said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised for not reporting that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials said the waves arrived at the time of the warning was issued.
Amateur records divided on social networks show a man on the upper floor who alerts people on the street below panic about coming tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall hit the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused the power outtake that cut communications around Palu by making it difficult for the rescue efforts of the government.
The military began sending cargo planes with humanitarian assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other basic supplies.
The city airport has been reopened for humanitarian flights and will be closed by October.
President Yoko Widododo scheduled a visit to evacuating centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami has risen above 800.
It's very bad.
Although the staff of the World Vision organization must have arrived from Donggala in Pala, where employees were located in tents raised in the backyard of the office, they witnessed the scenes of destruction on the road, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began to make the first steps to mitigate disaster, there were complaints that foreign high-quality humanitarian workers were not allowed to travel to Pala.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the inflow of foreign funds, supplies and people is only possible if the scene is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster of the province's level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonesia Red Cross.
"When the government says 'all right, this is a national disaster', we will be open to international aid, but that status is not yet declared."
As the second night of earthquake and tsunami falls on the Pala on Friday, friends and families of the missing still hope their loved ones will be saved by miracle and their earthquake story in this natural disaster will be mitigated.
Saturday, the boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was buried in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paraglyding team, trained two missing paraglycers in the face of the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandagi, were his students.
"As an elder member of the paraglajding team I carry my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls that hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel was expanded by the circles of paraglyders desperately sent whatsApp messages to competitors in Palu who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages had only one gray leather, instead of two blue crochets.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves took $26.750 while charging the ATMs in Newport complex on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves, according to a Newport police report, stole $26.750 from the Brink workers who filled the Newport bankomat on the Levee.
The car driver was emptying the ATM in the fun complex and preparing to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "runed behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be delivered.
The witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, according to the statement, but the police did not specify the number of involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changes the name to Ye
Reper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Publishing a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "It'll be known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been known for a while under the nickname Ye and has used the title of his eighth album, which was published in June.
A change occurred before his performance in the Saturday Night Live show, where his new album Yandhi is expected to be promoted.
He replaced a singer Ariana Grande who canceled the performance for "emotional reasons," the show author said.
In addition to the shortening of his current professional name, West said earlier that this word has religious importance for him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of the album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm me, it's us.
It came from Kanya, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of what we are."
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers Love and Brother Love's names.
The former West associate, JAY-Z, also used versions with or without a line and large letters.
AMLO in Mexico swore he wouldn't use an army against civilians
The elected President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday that "will never use the army to conquer the Mexican people".
The army shot at peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people at the time when the left-hand student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double the financing of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in the field, said the investor and practitioner of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US authorities issued publications on artificial intelligence, although the United States generally lacks an official strategy in the sense of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year: their goal is to be first in the area of artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"The double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, considering all other countries are much behind the United States, and we are looking for a new breakthrough in the range of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Double funds could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "Superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order" published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that proved superior to the highest ranked American Othello player, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee gave credit to earlier American government technological competitions such as the Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects and asked when they were planning the following competitions to identify future visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to make huge efforts to get government subsidies, Lee said.
"Don't take away China from our academic leaders, it's what corporations do," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have employed great individuals from the university in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigrant policy could also help the United States to strengthen their efforts in the sense of artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically offer green cards to doctors from the domain of artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued its plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences grants subsidies to people in academic institutions in a similar manner as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States established the Joint Intelligence Centre, which seeks to include partners from the industry and the academic community, and the White House announced the formation of the Election Committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a two-billion-dollar investment for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the National Science Foundation is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in researching artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that has been trying to form a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on the country's name change
Macedonian citizens voted on Sunday's referendum to change the country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a step to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked their membership in the European Union and NATO alliance.
Greece, who has a province called Macedonia, claims their northern neighbour's name represents the stumbling of its territory and has vetoed their entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement on the proposed name in June, but nationalist opponents claim this could jeopardise the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority in Macedonia.
President Djorđe Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the referendum would be at least 50 per cent needed to make the referendum valid.
The issue on the ballot said, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with an agreement with Greece."
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries created by the fall of Yugoslavia, is worth paying for the entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely within the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," Oliver Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, the number of parliamentary members said it would be governed by the outcome of the vote and that the result would be decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would be needed to change the name.
The National Election Commission said there was no irregularities report until 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when a total of 66 per cent of voters went to elections.
"I have come to vote for my children, it is our place in Europe," said (62) Giose Tanevski, a voter in the Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško voted in the Macedonian referendum on the change of the name, which could open their way to NATO membership in the Union and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small stage and dragged chairs outside the tents crucified by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join up, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are poor, but proud land.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro Asian community."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO alliance membership would bring over-necessary investments in Macedonia whose unemployment rate is higher than 20 per cent.
"I believe that a large majority will vote 'yeah' because more than 80 per cent of our population is for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after putting in the list.
He said the result of "pro" would be "affirmation of our future."
A poll published Monday in the Macedonian Institute for Political Research says between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum -- below the necessary turnout.
According to the second poll conducted by Macedonian Telema TV, 57% of respondents are planning to vote Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would vote "yes".
A 50 per cent turnout plus one vote is required to be a successful referendum.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the Western government since it came to power last May.
See: Manchester City Player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling have resolved the defense of Brighton in the victory of 2:0 Manchester City against Brighton at the Ethmad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed very easy when Aguero scored goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received the ball in the middle of the field at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three defense players of Brighton before he found himself in the open field.
Then Aguera was surrounded by three green clothes.
He pushed around one defense player and he was faster than a few more on the edge of naked Brighton.
Then he added to the left, finding Sterling.
The English assailant used his first blow in the criminal space to return the ball to Aguer, who with his right digging override Brighton Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right side of the net.
"Aguero had some foot problems," coach of City Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what it was.
We're lucky he scored a goal at that moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave the heavenly blues the initial advantage in the misunderstanding of the Prime Minister League.
He scored a goal at 29 minutes.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep on Brighton's part of the field.
He added beautifully Leroy Sane to the left-hand side.
Sane touched a few times before he sent Sterling to naked.
The sky-blue assailant put the ball into the net before he slipped off the field.
City fights Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Championships at 12:55 on Thursday at Rhein-Neckar-Aren stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a game without competition against Rockies.
Since Nationals was eliminated in an eliminated game, there was no reason to insist on another party.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to take position on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have a game of advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers at the NL West, are still in the game.
Rockies even have a direct passage due to a 5:2 victory against the Nationals on Friday, but they're still trying to win the first title in the league.
"Although we don't play for anything, even though we can get out on the ground knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and other teams will probably be at the highest level compared to all the other years.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in those terms?"
Nationals still need to announce the initial team for Sunday, but they're supposed to be willing to let Scherzer throw in that situation.
Scherzer, to whom it would be the 34th time to start the game, trained Thursday and would throw on Sunday when he usually rests.

Trump held a rally in West Virginia
The president briefly focused on the situation of his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of the Republican exit in the elections in half a term.
"All we've done will be at stake in November.
We're five weeks from the most important choices of our lives.
These are one of the big, big -- although I didn't run, I'm actually a candidate because I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "Look at these terrible, terrible groups of radical Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power using all possible ways, you see malice, dirty games.
They don't care who he will hurt, who he will run over to get power and control, power and control are what they want, and we will not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are in the mission of "resistance and distraction".
"And you saw it in the past four days," he said calling the Democrats "honest, evil, evil and unhonest."
He cited a democratic senator and a member of the Senate Justice Commission, Dianne Feinstein, the name that prompted the audience to resent loudly.
"You remember her answer?
Did you leak the document to the press?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I'm waiting – it was a really bad language of the body – the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts different attitudes.
It is untolerant to those who express their opinion
When the activists of Momentum in my local party branch voted to censor me, I wasn't surprised at all.
After all, I am the last in a series of labor members to be told that they are not welcome and all because we have expressed our opinion.
My colleague from parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resisted antisemitism.
In my case, the censors criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corby.
The importance of the responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, and it is ironic that these are similar problems Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification from the meeting of the Laboratory Party branch in Nottingham East on Friday is "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During the eight years I spent as a local labor member of parliament, meetings Friday night were mostly just like that.
Unfortunately, the tone of many meetings today is not such as the promise of "kind, more gentle" politics has been forgotten a long time ago, and the question is whether it ever was.
It has become more obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the lab game and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the leaders of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I believed shared similar political attitudes, they began to expect me to make a 180 degree turn and take a position that I would otherwise never agree with, whether it was about the national security or the single European Union market.
Every time I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- it's accompanied by a flood of insults on social networks, calls to remove from the party, the convictions of the centre policy and tell me that I shouldn't be in the lab party.
And that's not just happening to me.
On the contrary, I know I'm happier than some of my colleagues because the comments given to me are mostly political.
I am impressed with professionalism and determination by colleagues who deal with a flood of sexist or racist insults daily, but do not retreat.
Something that disappointed me most in this political age is how these levels of insult have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the lab party should nurture the culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different views and with every voice of untrust or by changing the rules of selection the party is narrowed down.
I've been given a lot of advice, and the last two years, they've been trying to get my head down, make me less loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student joined the lab game provoked by the government of Prime Minister Thatcher, which led my primary school to literally collapse, I was trying to advocate better public services to those who most need, either as a local councilor or minister in the government.
I've never hidden my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused by my political positions and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would recommend that, when the country is moving towards Brexit to jeopardize households, jobs and our public services, I do not understand why someone would waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laboratory Party.
But the main message that I have is not directed to the Momentum at Nottingham, but to the voters in my electoral unit, whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that the threats to remove from the party or political fiction will not prevent me from acting in the way I think it is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr at the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but no doubt Ayr has taken the deserved victory in this exciting game of the day at Tennent's Prime Minister's League.
Now they're on top of the table, the only ones undefeated of ten teams
In the end, the home team won because of the superior defense, as well as the number of chances used, and coach Peter Murchie had reason to enjoy it.
"We have been tested in matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayru, every honor, they took advantage of their chances better than us."
At the 14th minute of Grant Naderson's attempt to turn Frazier Climo, he gave Ayro the advantage, but the yellow chart for the Scottish captain of Rory Hughes, whom Warriors allowed to play, allowed Melrose to use the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot caught an unpreverted attempt.
Climo has increased the leadership of Ayr by penal before, just before half-time, he has achieved a solo attempt to score a score of 17:5 for Ayr on half-time.
But Melrose started the second half of the time well and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who turned Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, whom they took on the carriers, and in addition, Ayr increased the advantage of the attempted Stafford McDowall, who turned Climo.
Deputy Captain Ayra, Blair Macpherson, then got a yellow chart, and Melrose re-used the numerical supremacy with the unpreverted attempt of Bruce Colvin, after the period of severe pressure.
However, the hosts returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow chart due to the foul over Clima without a ball. MacPherson reached a touch down from a criminal line behind the coming Mole Ayro.
Climo turned, as he did almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe picked up the blow of David Armstrong into criminal space and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth attempt of the host.
The show star Still game is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
The Series Star Still Game, Ford Kieran, is preparing to move to the catering industry after knowing that he was appointed director of the company of licensed restaurants.
Fifty-six-year-old boy plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series for which he writes the script and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming nineth season will be the last in the show and Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of the Adriftmorn Limited company.
The actor refused to comment on the news, although the source of the Scottish Sun diary suggested that Kiernan wanted to join the "growing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling the seaside in La Paz.
In public buildings, ocean blue flags are floating.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued to the slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
Returning the sea exit is our obligation."
Throughout the land, Bolivia is still a strong memory of the coast they lost in behalf of Chile in the bloody crossing around natural resources in the 19th century – as well as the longing to rebuild the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the biggest in the last few decades while Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice's verdict on the first October after five years of the council.
"Bolivia has caught a stump, in the spirit of unity and prosperity, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the International Court of Justice in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favour of Bolivia and claims that -- after decades of Greek negotiations – Chile must agree to negotiations on giving Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Here's Morales, the charismatic Bollivian president of the native origin, who is ahead of a controversial fight for the next year's reelection, also plays a major role when it comes to a verdict that will be done on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it's unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia, and that little will change even if it decides.
The United Nations body with a headquarters in the Netherlands has no power to assign Chilean territory and has stated that it will not decide on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the verdict was expressed only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarat, a chilean expert in international law.
And instead of making progress in the Bolivian case, the last four years may have returned it.
"The problem of exit to the sea has captured the current Bolivian authorities for themselves," Zarat said.
Morales' fighting rhetoric killed the rest of Chilean goodwill, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point, but it will be very difficult to hold these negotiations after this.
These two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, refused the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia a "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "set a point at 139 years of disagreement on mutual satisfaction," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – uses the issue of sea exits as a political rat.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to the exit to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no disarmment until they can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would not lift nuclear weapons until they believe Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to obey the promises made during the Singapore summit between conflicted leaders.
His comments arrived at the moment when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared at the border to restart nuclear negotiations, more than three months after Singapore and a meeting with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says they're just letting dreams that the continuation of sanctions and opposition of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean war will ever throw North Korea on their knees.
Washington is not ready to agree with the declaration until Pjongjang makes significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want the second summit.
However, the government is a general skepticism when it comes to the seriousness of Pyongyang as regards the rejection of the nuclear arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the second summit of Kim and Trump.
On the Paris fashion reviews presented the latest line of giant hats that you will soon see in the nearby trade street
If you want to increase the collection of hats or completely cover the sun, you're in the right place.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of outrageous hats on the runways of their spring and summer magazines, shading everything on the Paris Week of fashion.
Extremely impractical hats won Instagram this summer, and these designers displayed their impressive creations on fashion tracks.
The most prominent Valentine's piece was an overhead hat with a broad feathered hood that swallowed the heads of the model.
Among the other glowing supplements were peppers with decorated stones, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but their purpose is not to keep your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had wet lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like dive equipment with respiratory and mask, and the other reminded of a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you're among those who follow the attraction trend, you're lucky.
Those who follow fashion predict that huge hats could be found on nearby trade streets.
The huge hats came after "La Bomba", a shattered hat with a two-foot-foot beam that was seen on many stars, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand that designed this very impractical hat that overwhelmed the social networks, sent another large creation on the runway – a slammed beach bag that was almost as large as the model that was carrying it.
Zagasitoranxed rafi bag and white leather lunch was the highlighted detail of Jacquemus' La Riviera collection for spring and summer 2019 at the Paris Week of fashion.
Stylist of the famous Luke Armitage said about FEMAIL: "I expect big hats and beach bags will arrive in stores in time for the next summer, since the designer left such a huge impression would be difficult to ignore the demand for pre-imensioned fashion accessories."
John Edward: Knowledge of language is crucial to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland can be commended with extraordinary academic achievements, which continued in 2018 with a new set of extraordinary results on exams, which was further strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, this school representing the Scotland Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seeks to provide the best level of services to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and more education, a chosen career and a place in the company of citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own teaching plan and program, we see that modern languages remain a popular and desirable electoral subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language that understands it, it's good for him."
"If you speak to him in his tongue, it pleases him."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build good relations and trust with people from other countries.
According to the test results this year, we see that the languages at the top of the league table, with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who taught foreign languages received grade A at the final exam of high school.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72% of students received A from Mandarin's final exam in high school, while 72% of those who learn German, 69% of those who learn French and 63% of those who learn Spanish also received a grade A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Languages, as electoral objects, are now treated in the same way as STEM objects (natural sciences, technology, machinery and mathematics) and in independent school programmes, and elsewhere.
The poll conducted by the British Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited in the difficulties of filling up jobs are just a lack of people who know foreign languages.
So knowing foreign languages is increasingly becoming necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increasingly potential jobs that require foreign language knowledge, this skill is necessary in the globalisation world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if he knows another language, he'll have a real advantage in the future because it's a skill for life.
The art of direct communication with people from foreign countries will automatically put a person who speaks more languages ahead of competition.
According to YouG's poll conducted among more than 4,000 Brits in 2013, 75 percent could not speak another language well enough to talk, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 per cent.
Consequently, investing in learning foreign languages is important for today’s children.
Knowing more languages, especially those used in developing economies, will give the children a better chance to find a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school is different when it comes to learning languages.
Many schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for Great Britain by 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a few languages that will be able to choose in independent schools, with professional teacher staff in this area.
Scotland Independent Schools are committed to ensuring the environment for learning to prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, whatever they are waiting for in the future.
At this time, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are crucial for the future of the country, so that must also be reflected in education.
Modern languages should certainly be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellentness to young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien only faire.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will debut for Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
Waiting soon ends for fans who want to see LeBron James's first performance for Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play on Sunday in the presidential match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But you still don't know how many minutes they're gonna play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said at the official Lakers website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, has been on the sketch that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about six games in the Lakers Presidency.
"In this stage of my career, I do not need pre-seasonal matches to prepare," he said.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump started a series of reelection events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five appointments in the next week including visits to friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While waiting for his vote to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court, Trump plans to boost support in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate because the Republicans risk losing control over Congress after the November vote.
When Trump's meeting in West Virginia tonight and how can you look at it on the network?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for seven hours tonight in Eastern Time, on Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's meeting in West Virginia under live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump will probably talk about hearings this week regarding the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court in which the charges of sexual harassment were tense, and the expected vote in the Senate was delayed in seven days until the FBI conducted the investigation.
But the ultimate goal of this series of gathering is to help the Republicans make better results in November's elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign said the events are held this week to "give energy to volunteers and supporters while the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters's information.
"The control of Congress is such a key part of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the election campaign season," the spokesman of Trump's campaign refused to present to Reuters.
An appointment at Westbankco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's meeting could gather supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News report.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who doesn't stand well in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president came to try to raise his rating in polls," said Simon Haeder, a politician at West Virginia University, according to a Reuters report.
2018 Ryder Cup: US team showed combatability to keep hope before individual matches on Sunday
After three unilateral sessions, the four on Saturday afternoon may be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing is a completely invented concept in sports, but one of those in which players truly believe, especially in competitions like this.
Who do they think has a moment?
"They took six points, and now four, so it can be said that the swing is on our side," Jordan Spieth said on his way out.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, four points more, with twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spieth says, still believe that they have some wind in their wings, and there's a lot that gives them encouragement, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each one took three points from possible four.
Spieth was great from the first to the last blow and leads by his example.
The exclamations of the celebrations were getting louder during his round, to finally play a key blow for the unsolved score in the fourth match when he and Thomas were behind two after two.
His final blow with a 15-hole match was welcomed with a similar exclamation, the one that reflects the faith that the American team has hope.
"You just have to give your best shot and take care of your sword," said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes that can bring glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, no doubt the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Unusual, but adorable European couple won all four matches and games without mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't play the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they were avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes Friday morning.
The game they have so far shown and the way they exchange energy with a loud audience has strengthened them in the position of main favourites on Sunday and there are no more popular players than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory while the sun sets out over the fields of Le Golf National.
It's best for both of us to be in different holes at the same time.
However, it is still early to talk about the European celebration.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergie Garcia, the hero of the game with four balls that morning, when he was playing in pair with Alex Noren.
One god's blow and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole from which they couldn't even swing to the end.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of your hole.
The game with four balls and fours is so fascinating to look from close to the interactions between couples, advice that they don't give and how the strategy can change at a time.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a great advantage before the final day, but this four session has also shown that the U.S. team has a desire to fight in which some have suspected, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder bath
Europe will enter in the final Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, since after Saturday matches in the game with four balls and four fours gained the advantage of 10:6 over the United States.
Inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, first led with two victorys over the unreasoned Tiger Woods, increasing the results so far on the fields of Le Golf National Clubs to four points.
Europeans Thomas Bjorn fought to regain the trophy they lost at the Hazeltine golf club two years ago, dominated over the inaccurate Americans in the morning game with four balls and won the 3-1 series.
The United States has given greater resistance to the Four Tournament, conquering two matches, but could not reduce the shortfall.
Jim Furyk's team must win eight points in 12 individual matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debitant who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a fantastic weekend, just another couple in Ryder Cup history who won four points in the first four matches.
After they ran over Woods and Patrick Reed in a game with four balls, they composed and overcome the exhausted Woods and American debitant Bryson Dechambeau with even more convincing 5:4.
Woods who slipped through two matches on Saturday, at moments shined, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in a game with four balls and fours and seven in a row.
Juston Rose, who rested during the morning game with four balls, returned to partner Henrik Stanson at the Four Tournament and suffered defeat 2:1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third in the world.
Europe did not all go according to the plan of this pleasant clear day southwest of Paris.
The three-way winner of the Jordan Spieth main tournament and Justin Thomas set a two-point target for Americans on Saturday.
They fought 2-1 against John Rahm and Ian Poulter in a game with four balls to return later and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4:3 in fours, after they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder's history, some team came back after four points behind each match, even though Furyk's side defending the title is enough unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in second place, however, it seems they could not perform a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea recommends that "no talk" of unilateral disarmment unless there is trust
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepened its lack of confidence in the United States and that under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Hu said at the UN's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures in the past year to demonstrate goodwill", such as the interruption of nuclear and missile tests, nuclear polygon demontations and promises that it will not multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But there is no proper reaction to the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances there is no talk about the first one being unilaterally disarmed."
Although Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea against Washington's resistance to "step" access to denuclearisation by which North Korea would be rewarded for progressive steps, the significance of his statement was that he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation from the game as Pjongjang did before.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the current US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work on "the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with security guarantees.
North Korea seeks a formal ending of the Korean war (1950-53), but the United States said Pjongjang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also disobeyed invitations to mitigate international sanctions to North Korea.
"The United States does not give up "denuclearisation before all" and increase the level of sanctions to achieve their goal by force, opposing even "the declaration of ending the war", Ri said.
"The opinion that sanctions can throw us on our knees is that the dreams of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that prolonged sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke about in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "Let's negotiate with South Korea on this denuclearisation problem, not with the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not come to such an undeclared position."
However, the tone of Ri's speech dramatically differed from last year, when the UN General Assembly said that the shooting of US land missiles with North Korea was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "racketer" on a suicide mission.
This year, in the United Nations Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, he praised Kim for the courage to take steps to disarm, but he said that there is much more to do and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea implements the denuclearisation.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a time frame for this, saying, "If necessary, let it take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim the UN Security Council should be awarded Pjongjang for the steps they've taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council Sanctions must continue strictly and without condescending to be implemented until complete, final, confirmed denuclearisation occurs."
The Security Council unanimously supported sanctions to North Korea applied since 2006, in an effort to prevent financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rijeh outside the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip hasn't gone well.
In July, he left Pjongjang saying that progress was made, and North Korea sentenced him only a few hours later for the "gangster demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle the missile polygon as well as the nuclear complex if the United States take "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that "appropriate measures" demanding security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps in order to normalise relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on how to rest enough
The new course at Harvard University this year aims to get students to sleep more in an effort to eradicate increasingly popular macho culture learning "all night with caffeine".
One academic observed that the world’s leading university students are often ignorant about the basic concern of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep at Harvadro's Medical Faculty and a specialist in Brigham and Women's, created a course that he thinks is the only kind in the United States.
The inspiration to launch this course was given after a speech he held on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this only now, in my absolvent year?"
She said no one ever told her how important her dream was -- which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
This year's course is the first time that takes place for students on the basis of how good sleeping habits contribute to better academic and sporting results, as well as improving their general condition.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical College and the CEO of the University Health Service, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was noted that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of the room in a student's home and students should click on cups for coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on athletic performances and the significance of routine before sleeping.
In the other part, participants were told that a long-term lack of sleep could increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We are aware that this will not instantly change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on health has the decision to smoke cigarettes," Professor Ceisler said.
The pride culture because of "the awakening night" still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to the lack of sleep becoming a growing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, and that quality, should be a "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even against excess kilograms, since the lack of sleep of the brain crosses into a hunger regime, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a nineteen-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Ceisler develop a course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year in Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and inspired him to advocate for his maintenance at the whole campus level.
He hopes that the next step is that all post graduates are asked to pass a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to think about setting up the alarm at the time to sleep and wake up and to take care of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitting electronic screens and LED lighting and can disturb circadian rhythm, thus causing sleep problems.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's team
The Rangers experienced another depressing defeat in the guests when Dolly Menga kicked out Steven Gerrard's team to defeat 1:0 of Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to take the first victory in the guests after February's 4th triumph in St Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt only gave Gerrard another defeat in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unacceptable League Prime Minister Ladbrokes leaders, Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before the semi-time, and the uninspired Rangers never came anywhere near the equation.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third and behind the Hibernian are just for the goal difference.
The Rangers could face additional problems after the Line Judge Calum Spence had to show help when he was shot by a case on the side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that overtake Ayr and went to the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was set up for the same eleven Livingston players who took the point to Hearts last week and would be thrilled by the way his well-trained team pushed opponents at every step.
The Rangers may have dominated the property of the ball, but Livingston has better used his time with the ball.
It was a little short to reach the goal only two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the middle player missed a great chance and kicked him next to the goal.
Deep free hit by Keaghan Jacobs then found the captain of Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow just managed to kick his ass by the naked side of the statue.
The Rangers managed to take over, but their game in the last third gave more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he was supposed to get a pen in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the request of the Colombian.
The Rangers only scored two goal strikes in the first half, but the former goalman Ibrox, Liam Kelly, had no major problems defending the head of Lassana Coulibaly and tampered with the shot that Ovie Ejaria put in.
Although the first goal of Livingston in the 34th minute may not have reflected the true relationship of power in the course of the game, no one can dispute that he was earned, if for nothing else, then for the effort made.
The Rangers couldn't cope with the deep free blow of Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple ending.
Gerrard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and that replacement almost immediately gave the result when the wing player hired Morelos, but impressive Kelly ran from his line and blocked it.
However, Livingston continued to instruct guests to play just as they please, with the long balls of Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team had a chance to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor was well held up and defended Jacobs' attack, so that Lithgow would send the ball from the corner by the naked side.
The deputy Rangers, Glenn Middleton, at the end of the game, wanted another penal when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't react again.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now, the station from our Sunday Morning almanah: September 30, 1882 on this day 136 years ago... the day when future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that will eventually become a device known as Geiger's counter.
Except one of the main points of science, Geiger's counter has its own place in pop culture, as in the 1950s movie "Zvona Coronada", where they played seemingly amazing cowboy scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
A man, "What is it?"
Rogers: "It's Geiger's counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on those headphones, you can hear with your ears the effects of atoms thanks to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, it's a crack!"
Hans Gaiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new vaccine against cancer could teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and then kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of therapy
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from patients and their changes in the laboratory
They can see protein that is common in many types of carcinoma, and then they inject again.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who received treatment with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize evil cells has disappeared for over 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their remodeling in the laboratory so that they can "see" protein HER2, and re-inject them.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American Institute for malignant disease in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
Her2 "helps growth of several types of cancer" including breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
Similar access to the extraction of immune cells from patients and "teaching" the same how to target malignant cells was effective in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a strong speech to support Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his performance in the SNL show.
He didn't have a good time.
Kanye West was whistled in a study during the Saturday Night Live show after a stunning performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After performing his third song called Ghost Town, that night he wore the hat with the title "Make America great," he insulted the Democrats and spoke again about his support to Trump.
"How many times have I talked to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?
So if I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started a sketch show that played Matt Damon and in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate's judicial commission on the claims of Christine Blasey Ford's sexual harassment.
Although it's not broadcast, the video of West speech was shared by Commissioner Chris Rock on social networks.
It's not clear if Rock tried to make fun of West by setting up a video.
West also complained to the public that it was hard behind the towers for his hat.
"They teased me behind the towers.
They said: “Don’t go out with that hat on your head. ”
They teased me!
And then they say for me that I fell down," Washington Examiner quoted me as saying.
West continued, "Do you want to see what that looks like?" adding that "will wear Superman's coat because that means you can't command me.
Try love."
His comments caused the audience to whistle at least twice, and the members of the SNL show were visiblely ashamed, Variety passed, while one person who was present said, "The whole studio was completely silent."
Westa was brought in as a replacement for Ariana Grande, whose former partner, Raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing a song and hunting it disguised in a bottle of Perrier.
Westa supported the leader of the TPUS conservative group, Candace Turner, who claimed: "One of the bravest souls: thank you for not retreating before the perpetrators."
But Karen Hunt's show manager claimed that West was simply what he really was and that it was absolutely beautiful.
"But I choose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "artitude") for whom I believe he embraced and extended ideology that hurts my society.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, a rapper posted on Twitter that he changed his name, saying that now "it will be known as Kanye West before".
He's not the first artist who changed his name and followed the rates of Diddy, who's also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was called Snoop Lion, and of course the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then into "the artist previously known as Prince".

The Star of the Throne Games, Kit Harrington condemned toxic cat culture
Kit Harrington is famous for his role as Jon Snow, who beats the sword in a violent medieval fantasy, the HBO series Game of the throne.
However, an actor, 33, collapsed on a stereotype of a hero's cat, saying that such roles on the screen mean that boys are often considered to be rude to be respected.
In a statement for Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of a toxic cat of culture in the time #MeToo.
The whale who recently married a partner from the Game of the Throne Leslie Rose, 31, admitted that he had a "powerful need" to deal with this problem.
"Personally, I am currently quite troubled by the question – what have we wrongd with representing manhood?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, when it comes to a problem that we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the spread of a toxic cat of culture for showing characters that are represented as men.
He continued, "What is innate, and what is the issue of education?
What is it that teaches us on TV and what makes young people think they have to fit into a certain pattern of man's behavior?
I think that, in fact, is one of the main issues of our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong for the young."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the advances or extensions of the Game Throne series after its end next summer, saying he "finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will be acting in Sam Shepard True West's theater, the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in the Throne Game.
"In this series I met my wife, so it can be said that she has given me a future family and my life from now on," he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritta, the love partner of Keith's character Jon Snow in this fantastic show that won the Emmy Prize.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Lesla's parents in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of new cases of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
A large majority of new cases have been passed through sexual relations, which is a change compared to the previous situation.
Usually in the past, HIV rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions infected with the virus.
However, the number of people who receive HIV in this way is reduced almost to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, from year to year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS increased by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sexual relations is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality in China has no longer been considered illegal since 1997, but they say that the discrimination of LGBT is highly widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative understanding in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men eventually get married to women.
The transmission of the virus is often due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to solve this problem.
Maxine Waters denied allegations that one of her staff published information on the Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
The US MP Maxine Waters denied the allegations that one of her staff published personal data by three US Republican senators on Wikipedia of these lawmakers.
The Democratic MP from Los Angeles argues that you are being posted by experts and the website of the "ultrade wing".
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in publication on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and Utah senator Lindsey Graham's phone numbers from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate Commission on claims on sexual harassment against candidates for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address was the source of the announcement associated with the Waters office and published information about its staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely incorrect and absolute lie," said Waters.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are compromised because of these false and incorrect claims – in no way is responsible for revealing this information.
"This unfounded claim is a completely false and absolute lie."
Waters' statement soon triggered a verdict on the Internet, also issued by former Secretary for the White House Press, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial goes with anger," wrote Fleischer.
"This points to the conclusion that she does not have the temperament needed for a member of Congress.
When they accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't be angry.
He mustn't be daring.
He can't question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and calm."
Fleischer clearly compared Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of acting too angry at hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who was running to dismiss Waters in the middle of his mandate, also voted through Twitter.
"The big thing if it's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office warned "the relevant competent institutions and judicial authorities about these false claims".
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they are responsible for all their actions that are unstable and dangerous for all my staff members."
Film review Johnny English again in action – a soft spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It has already gone into tradition to look for a subtext about Brexit in every new film with British thematics, which can also be applied to this continuation of the satiric action comedy about Johnny English – which began in 2003 by the achievement of "Johnny English" and returned to screens in 2011 by continuing "Johnny English: reborn".
Will ironic autosat about how obviously we are useless be the new export opportunity for the nation?
Either way, an incompetent Johnny English rubber face was given a new opportunity to screw up something – in which his name more than anything reveals that it is a general comical creation designed for territories with a cinema of which an English audience is not a mother language.
It is, of course, about a silly secret agent who, despite the bizarre pretenses on the highest glamour, wears a little Clouseau, a glimpse of Mister Bean and a piece of that guy who played only one note in thematic melody of the achievement of "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It was also originally based on a traveler and an international man who was covered by a secret that Atkinson used to act in now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
One or two scenes of the latest's venture are good.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval knight armor and the knives of the rotators swelled about his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor seems weak and in a very strange way surplus, especially now that "serious" film brands as 007 and the impossible mission self-confidentially add comic elements.
The impression is that it's about humor for children, not for adults, and for me the distracted adventures of Johnny English are not inventive and developed as Atkinson's gegs in the style of German films in the image of Mister Beana.
Now it is a very current theme that the Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The hacker infiltrated the British super secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of agents on duty – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop in a full glass of water for the prime minister, the pompous and depressed character who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to the decline of political popularity: Emma Thomson has maestrally played this character designed by the model of Theresa May, but the scenario is rather scarce.
Her intelligence advisors informed her that all active spys were compromised and that they would have to hire one of the retired officers.
And that means wet Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a fancy facility, but is informal about how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gegs when English holds the spying academy in the manifold of "School Rock".
The English quickly return to Whitehall for urgent instructions and to reassemble it with former incredibly patient partner Bough, who is playing again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander whose energetic and vocal role of Vicky Pepperdine is a little spent.
So Batman and Robin for robbing things are again at the service of Her Majesty's secret service and the happiness of the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, interpreted by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into a trap of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the vicious Jason Walt, who is acting like Jake Lacy.
English and Bough starts their Odyssee of Comic Events: disguised as waiters, they set fire to the elegant French restaurant, making a haos with a crisp boarding on Voltina luxury yacht and English starts a real anarchy trying to get familiar with the inside of Volta's house, using headphones for virtual reality.
It's obvious that a great effort was put into this last sequence, but no matter how sweet and merry it was, the whole movie was made for children.
Pretty median quality.
Like the other Johnny English movies, I can't wonder if the British film industry can create a role for Rowan Atkinson that would really show his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but they were paid for five.
The party allegedly wants company heads to transfer the time they save for workers thanks to the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day off.
Employers would enjoy the three-day weekend – but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "enter" into the party's economic programme and plans to improve labour conditions and labour rights.
The transition to a four-day working week has been approved by the union convention as a way that workers can use a variable economy.
A high source from the Labour Party said to Sunday Times: "A new policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
This is not going to happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an ambition that fits in a party approach to the rebalance of the economy in favour of workers, as well as in the party industrial strategy at all."
The Labourist Party would not be the first to approve such an idea because the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, this ambition has no support for the entire Labour Party.
Labourist Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not party politics and the party is not considering it."
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to expose his view of the Socialist Revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the hands of "noble directors" and "profits" in the municipal businesses.
Opposition Chancellors also mean that the current owners of the water supply companies might not regain their entire investments because laburists could impose "deductions" based on injustices seen.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on boards of companies and to create inclusive equity funds that would grant 10% of the company's own value in the private sector to employees who are likely to collect annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy is talking about the 60-minute show about whether the FBI investigation could change their minds.
The FBI investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week and withdraws the question whether the Bureau's investigation could lead some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, the correspondent of the 60-minute show, Scott Pelley, asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think so, of course," said Kennedy.
"Before the hearing I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges appeared, I asked, ‘Did you do it?’
He was steadfast, determined, unequivocable."
However, Senator Graham's voice seems to be detonated.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh has been formed and a strong accusation would require," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it," Graham added, speaking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she calls can't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Festival of citizens of the world and has he done anything that would reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will be hosting the Festival of Citizens of the World, an annual music event with a really impressive star list that will perform, and an equally impressive goal – to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Festival of the Citizens of the World will gather tens of thousands of people on the great lawn of Central Park who will not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true purpose of this event, which will end extreme poverty until 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, for the first time held in 2012, is an extension of the global project against poverty, an international group that advocates the abolition of poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting the same.
To get a free ticket for the event (except if you're not willing to pay for VIP card), those who wanted to attend the concert had to do a series of tasks or "works", such as volunteering, sending e-mails to the world leader, telephone call and any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal – ending poverty.
But how successful is the Citizen of the World with only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to do something, or just another vision of so-called "clictivism" – when people believe that they have done something that will change the world by signing a petition on the Internet or tweeting?
Since 2011, a citizen of the world's initiative has claimed that more than 19 million "actions" of their supporters have been advocated for a number of different goals.
They say these actions have led world leaders to publish promises and political directions worth more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people until 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and publications resulting from their actions, and at least 10 billion dollars have already been allocated or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have already directly affected 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the power of nutrition, the partnership of investors and realists from the Great Britain who promised to "help children to grow into their full potential", pledging that the Ruands would allocate $35m to end the country's nutrition after receiving more than 4700 Twitters from the citizens of the world.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make the social injustice of nutrition become a historic note," the ambassador of the Power of Food, Tracey Ullman, told live concert visitors in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on Britain to improve mothers and children's diet, the government announced that it would finance the Food Power project, whose interventions would touch the lives of 5 million women and children.
In answer to one of the often asked questions on their website that says "why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
The citizen of the world replies, “It will be a long and difficult way, and sometimes we will fall down and fall down.
However, as all the major movements for civil rights and against the apartmenthead before us, we will succeed because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are just some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be led by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could "block" Russia in energy exports – Interior Secretary
Washington can "if necessary" use its navy to prevent Russian energy exports to third markets, including the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the US Interior Secretary, reported by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claims that Russian engagement in Syria -- namely, there are legal governments -- an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they want to sell energy in the Middle East is why they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe and the centre of Southern Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the officials, there are ways and means to resolve this matter.
"The United States have this opportunity to ensure that marine coridors remain open together with our Navy or to block them, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not go to the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event whose organiser was the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group calling himself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington with relations with Russia and Iran, stating the same issue.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less in the exploitation and fuel replacement," he said saying Russia has only one leverage, and its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after Trump's administration's mission to increase the exports of combined natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia as a far more favourable option for European consumers.
For this purpose, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project North Stream 2 which would, according to Trump, make Berlin a "conqueror" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline amounted to 11 billion dollars and that should double the existing capacity of gas pipeline at 110 billion cubic metres, exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the reasons for the vigorous opposition of Washington to this project are purely economic and that this is an example of unfaithful competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should have the choice of suppliers," Russian Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who was held in Moscow in September.
The United States' position has triggered a reaction to Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Alliance of the German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, the president of the Alliance of the German Industry (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider seriously" the presidential bid for 2020, State Senator Masachusetts said
The senator of the state Masachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "really consider" running for president after the next medieval elections.
During a meeting in the City Hall in the City of Holyoka in the state of Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which includes a woman at the top," the source The Hill quoted her as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president."
Warren called President Donald Trump during a meeting in the city council, saying he "he's leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was called for the criticism of Trump and his candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In her tweet published on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, the polls released on Thursday showed that the majority of the election bodies voted for Warren did not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of voters who will vote "probably" in the state of Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Center for Political Research of the University of Suffolk/List of Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent backed the candidacy.
The poll showed that there is greater support for the bidding of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent voters supporting potential candidacy and 48 per cent against the candidacy.
The other sound names of the Democrats discussed in terms of their potential bids in 2020 were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talked about Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's meeting of support.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
He was arrested and accused of family violence after an incident Monday evening
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after the return, I can link to what happens to other families that suffer the consequences of PTSD and the vulnerability with which our soldiers return," the public told the president Donald Trump at the town of Tuls, in Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a burnt topic" and, speaking of his son and other war veterans, added "they return a little different, returning harder, wondering if there is respect against what their fellow soldiers and pilots have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence -- attacking a woman's person, disrupting family reporting violence and possession of weapons under opium act, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of the Vasil Police Administration.
18 countries, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the review of a new US policy that deprives asylum to victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the District submitted a friendly report to the court in Washington on Friday to support asylum seekers who dispute this policy, NBC News reported.
A full name of prosecutors in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions that the U.S. Civil Liberty Union filed in August against the federal police has not been discovered.
She said her partner was abused "and violent members of his gang," but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was detained in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace explained that the countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum seekers in the United States, face a growing problem with gangs and family violence.
The new US asylum policy has revoked the decision of the 2014 Committee on Appeal for Immigrants, which enabled immigrants who did not own documents and fled family violence to apply for asylum.
The state prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "has been neglecting decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Allied Law requires all asylum requirements to be decided on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of demands, and thus the chamber violates that principle," the friendly report said.
Advocates further argue in the report that the police that prevents the immigrants from entering is harmful to the U.S. economy and will likely become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, State Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges in migrant cases to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing family violence and gang violence.
"Azil is only available to those who leave their home countries for persecution or fear of being affiliated by a certain race, religion, nationality or a certain social group or because of their political opinion," Sessions said in a statement on June 11th talking about politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to mitigate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people worldwide face daily.
Desperate rescue efforts in the city of Palo while the number of dead is doubled in search of survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"It is very tense," Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother said by comforting her sick little boy at the evacuation centre in the devastated city of Pala.
"Emergency assistance shall be transported every minute.
The government's lack of clean water."
The inhabitants return to their devastating homes, searching over flooded things trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals devastated by a 7.5 degree earthquake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured like Dwi Harris who had broken back and shoulder, were located outside the Palua War Hospital, where patients were provided help outside because of continuational strong concussions.
His eyes are full of tears as he tells how he felt a strong earthquake that shattered the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed by the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press agency, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying calling for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of carrying out "proportioned ads violence"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published an ad on four pages in the U.S. daily bragging the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the US press to expand propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump focused on the paid addition of Chinese newspapers China Daily to Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of mixing in the elections for the US Congress to be held on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere with US elections indicates, as US officials told the Reuters agency, a new phase in an escalating campaign led by Washington to press China.
While it is common that foreign governments publish ads with the aim of promoting trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war where they increase each other's import tariffs.
As a countermeasure, earlier Chinese tariffs in this trade war were aimed at exporters in countries such as Iowa, supporting Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former long-term mayor of the Iowa state, who is the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a comment published in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, "now doubles this violence by publishing propaganda ads in our free press."
"With spreading its propaganda, the Government of China exploits the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, placing a paid ad in the newspaper Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, on a kiosk here down the street in Beijing, you will find a limited number of different opinions and you will not be able to see any real reflection of the different opinions that people in China may have on the difficult economic path of China, bearing in mind that Chinese media are under a strong bat of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which newspaper it is about.
Republicans discourage women from voting in advance of medieval elections with Cavanaugh Debacle, analysts warn
Analysts warned that many of the most prominent Republicans who defend and stand by the candidate for the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several charges of alleged sexual assaults, will experience negative reactions, especially women, during the upcoming medieval elections.
The emotions related to this issue are very intense and most Republicans already show that they want to give their vote.
There is no back in these things," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, in an article for a magazine published on Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had last-minute requesting the FBI investigation would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow, not in November," Washington, D.C. said on Friday, senior advisor and state spokeswoman.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "november coming!" during demonstrations in the Senate hall, while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to endure with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be enormous," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news.
"People say he's already tall, which is true.
But he could be higher, especially among indecisive female voters in suburbs and young voters between 18 and 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, do not vote."
Even before Ms. Ford's public testimony detailing the alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge, analysts believed that there could be negative reactions if the Republicans insist on the appointment.
"This has become a major confusion for the Great Old Party," the NBC News network quoted Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee president earlier this week.
"It is not only about the vote of the Committee or the final vote, nor whether Kavanaugh will be a judge, it is also about the way the Republicans solved this issue and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities Group, who supports the election of Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a gentle leaning on the side of Kavanaugh.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Besides, 38% said he thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30% said they thought that was ford.
After Flake's initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least another person who filed the charges, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh was drunk on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez allegedly claimed that the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals while attending parties during their studies in Yale 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet that will outweigh Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web network, launches a startup aimed at being a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform Solid, whose maker is Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who people have access to information.
In an exclusive integration for Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the intention of Inrupt is "the world dominance."
"We must do it now," he said talking about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solida technology to enable people to create their own "personal data store on the network" or POD (personal online data store).
It can contain a list of contacts, a list of commitments, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, they're all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique for a personal data store on the network is that it completely depends on the user who can access what kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal intensification through data."
According to the head of the company, John Bruce, the idea is that the Inrupt company secures sources, processes and appropriate skills so that Solid can be accessible to everyone.
The company currently appears to be Berners-Lee, Bruce, the IBM Security Platform, a number of employees of development engineers engaged to work on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
Since this week, technology engineers around the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a statement from Saturday on the Medium Platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem that would protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Institute of Technology Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a very powerful voice in the discussion of the neutrality of the network.
Although the Inrupt starts, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Open Data Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of Victoria's cross to the priest in World War I
Celebrating in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church, who was awarded Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War, was encompassed in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won his confession on September 29, 1918 for the attack in the towns of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But a few days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he won the greatest British military confession.
At a parade held in Rushden on Saturday, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren discovered a memorial panel.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that a monument was discovered exactly 100 years after the sublime that his grandfather received the prize.
According to the newspaper London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under a strong shooting from the battle and machine gun."
Later, he rushed to the fire line, and with "the greatest heroism" he led the lead forward before he ran into the Polish cannon without any help and cut three of the military squad.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, a little more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's moves were "something I know I could never reach, but also something that causes obedience."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero shows the support many will give."
MMA fans who stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead get Pepa Pigs
Imagine that, you stayed up all night to watch a series of Bellator 206, to end up excluding you from watching the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 battles, including six on the main list and was displayed live during the night at Channel 5 Channel Channel Channel in Britain.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face, the viewers in the Great Britain remained amazed when the transmission broke Pep Pigs.
Many were not impressed that they stayed awake all night until early morning just because of the fight.
One fan on Twitter described this disconnection with a cartoon film as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's about the government's regulation where it says that at 6:00 in the morning that content is inappropriate, and they had to replace it with a program for children," said Dave Schwartz, senior Vice-President of the Bellator for Marketing and Communications, on the issue of transfer.
"Pepa Pigs," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Coker said he would work on his schedule to include viewers from the Great Britain in the future.
"I think when I talk about replacing, I think we can probably solve this," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realise anything until Sunday is present with us, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was an interruption, there were copies circulating and all hostile.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't, it was a matter of government jurisdiction.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We'll reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic driver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become successful.
A 24-year-old said he only realized in high school that "not everyone's like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Dessert Island Discs representing Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke openly about gay rights to give others " hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular leader of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, was away for several months because of the disease.
Having appeared as an apostate in Laverne's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "small worthy" of others because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, these feelings of less value and the feeling that I was different were the right things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it was "somebody," he said, so people don't get disappointed when they eventually find out about his sexuality.
A double bronze Olympic medal winner became a very important fighter for the LGBT population and used his appearance on this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he had the opportunity to speak publicly without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The Triple World Championship said that falling in love with a man, the American producer of Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "he was surprised."
Daley married last year with the Oscar winner, who was 20 years older of him, and said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so much while you're so young" -- the first time he showed up at the Olympics when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
A couple made it into the role of the parents of the boy Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "all perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was only about "I must win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympic Games.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son had the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 in 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they still had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be here to sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand while he stopped breathing and only when he really stopped breathing and when he was dead I finally realized he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life -- to swim in front of the domestic audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It served as an inspiration for his first choosing - the Proud of Heather Small - who responded in it while preparing for the Olympics and still passing it by the grunts.
Dessert Island Discs is on Radio 4 BBC on Sunday at 11:15 A.M.
Mickelson van form on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he's gonna play his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he's gonna have to recover the form so that this can't be an unhappy turning point.
Mickelsson, who plays on the biennale for the record 12th time, Captain Jim Furyk sent to the bench in Saturday's games with four balls and games to four.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as it was often the case for the United States, the five-fold main winner spent the day in cheering and improving the range in the game, hoping to correct what bothers him.
This 48-year-old, who was never the best player, even at the peak of his career, is not the ideal choice for Le Golf National's demanding field, where a long sloppy field regularly punishes the stray kicks.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open Championship on Sunday, Francesca Molinari, who won all four of their matches this week in the team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual matches at four points less, reach a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he trusted his man, but he couldn't even say anything more.
"He fully understood the role he had today, popped me on his shoulder and hugged me, and said he would be ready by tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He very much believes in himself.
He's a member of the Famous House and has contributed so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I sure as hell didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it went, and we thought it had to go that way.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will override Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup where he never fully reached the level of his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven semi-times, although Furyk said his presence brought a certain immaterial value to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and it's great to have such a guy on the team," he explained.
"I think it was fun for younger players to give him a chance, and this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a huge advantage could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup matches can easily be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Days first appeared at a game held in the city of Valderram in 1997, when a party whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had the advantage of five points over the Americans, but ended the competition with a close difference of 141⁄2-131.2.
"You constantly recall that we had a great advantage in Valderrama, we had a great advantage in Brooklin where we lost, and in Valderram where we won," Bjorn said, conceived after seeing the team in 2018, which won the score of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday led 10-6 in the Le Golf National field.
So history and everyone on that team will show me this isn't over.
You're going to the end tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy and that remains focus.
I talk all the time, I'm focused on 12 players on our side, but we're very well aware of what's across the street -- the world's biggest players."
Excited by the performance of his players at the hard golf tournament, Bjorn added: "I would never let this take me.
Tomorrow's a new day.
Tomorrow's an individual game, and that's something else.
It's great to be there with a partner when things go well, but when you're there alone, you test the ultimate possibilities of yourself as a golf player.
That's a message you have to convey to the players - give it the most of you tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner and he must also do the best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague Jim Furyk will ask his players to play better individually than they played in couples, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Suryk himself was at both ends of these major turns of the last day, since he was part of the winning team in Brookline before he ended up a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when he asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When it starts with such a stump, it creates a lot of pressure on the middle game.
We formed our position in line with it and we prepared the boys so we could try to perform a little magic tomorrow, you know."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the upper half.
"I went with this group of guys in a set like this because I think she can cover all the way to the end," Bjorn said about choosing single players.
A new German warship waiting again
The new German Navy frigate was scheduled to be launched in 2014 to replace old Cold Warships, but it will not arrive in at least another year due to system failures and emergency costs, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", a leading ship in the class of new Baden-Wuerttemberg fregate, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoted as saying by the military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems after delivery compromised the fate of this ambitious project.
Four Navy ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that were ordered in 2007 will replace the old bremen fregate class.
As far as it is known, it will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-air and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - the latest frigates should be scheduled up to two years without returning to the home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the most modern warships, which were to allow Germany to dispose of forces outside its territory, will already be aged at the time when they begin to be used, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate fregate F125 arrived in the newspaper last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship to use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the shipbuilder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for returning, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" which would make the ship, if it were to be deployed into a battle mission, unusable.
Software shortages were of special importance because Baden-Wuerttemberg's ships will manage a crew of about 120 sailors -- exactly half of the number of people who managed the old fregatates of the Bremen class.
It also turned out that the ship is significantly too heavy that reduces its effect and restricts the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
7.000 tonnes of heavy boat "Rheinland-Pfalz" are believed to be twice the size of ships similar to the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to incorrect hardware, the price of a complete project, including staff training, also becomes problematic.
It is said that it reached an astonishing €3.6 billion euros, compared to the beginning of 2.2 billion.
The problems related to the latest frigates are particularly significant in light of recent warnings that the maritime power of Germany is reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Parliamentary Defense Commission, admitted that the Navy in fact "is running out of ships that can be distributed."
The official said that this problem has risen over time because old ships have been shut down and no replacement ships have been acquired.
He complained that none of the frogs from Baden-Wuerttemberg could join the Navy.
The National Fund taps the secret life of the bat
A new study conducted on one estate in the hills of Scotland aims to discover how bats use landscape in search of food.
The results are expected to cast a new light on the behaviour of the only flying mammals and serve as a guide in future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists from the National Fund of Scotland will be accompanied by ordinary bats and the kind of soprano Pipistrelle, and the brown long-happy bat and bat of the species Daubenton in the Gardens Gardens Gardens Gardens in Wester Ross.
The special recording device will be set at key locations around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of all records will determine the frequency of bat calls and what they do.
Then the habitat map and the report will be produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a natural conservation adviser in NTS, hopes that the results will show what habitats are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the use of habitat management work, such as meadow creation, and which is the best way to keep the forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and UK has significantly reduced during the last century.
They are jeopardised by construction and development works, which have a negative impact on beds and the loss of habitat.
The windmills and lighting can also be a risk, including sticky paper and chemical processing of construction materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting at night, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when they catch the spoils.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to locate bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 ha countries across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct checks, inspections of beds, and sometimes rescue.
The organization even established the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland on the Treave estate in Dumfrey and Galloway, which are home for eight of ten bat species in Scotland.
David Thompson's estate manager says the estate is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a large area for bats here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all good habitats.
But there is so much more unknown about bats, so what we do here and in other estates will help us understand better what they need to advance."
He stresses how important it is to verify whether bats are on the property, because it is possible that the accidental destruction of a mother's bed will kill up to 400 females and young women, likely extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by animals and by law they are forbidden to kill, harassment, harassment or destruction of their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an official of the Scotland Bat Conservation Fund, has encouraged the public to engage and help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and we simply don’t know how the population of most of our species is developing. ”
Ronaldo drops rape charges while lawyers press charges against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described rape charges as "false news," saying people "wanted to promote" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue German magazine Der Spiegel, who announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently after that, he paid her $375,000 to shut up this incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his followers who had 142 million in the video on the Instagram Live network, several hours after the charges report, Ronaldo 33, criticised reports calling them "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," the five-fold Golden Ball winner said in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get glory talking about me, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added laughing.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for these allegations, which they called "inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions," according to the Reuters agency.
The lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "nematerial damage in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the injury, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in the apartment of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents delivered to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
The mayor claims that Ronaldo kneeled after the alleged incident and told her he was "99% a good guy" who failed those "1%."
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but he was willing to.
The mayor also argued that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries in the hospital, but that she later agreed to an alien settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried that she would "be publicly humiliated."
A 34-year-old says she's now seeking an annulment because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of crossing to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time that was allegedly an attack, and this summer he moved into the Italian diva Juva for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will regret losing car manufacturers forever
UK will "forever regret" if it loses the status of the world's driver in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "disturbing" what Toyota UK said about BBC -- if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement that it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of the delay on the borders in case Bexit was out of agreement could cause the loss of jobs.
The Toyotin Auris and Avensis factory produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see a stopping production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Director-General Toyote in Burnastone.
Other UK producers including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed fear about how cross-border trade would work if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement.
BMW, for example, says he's going to close his mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main fears refer to what car manufacturers call car risks in the supply chain in the case of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyote production line operates on the principle of "Right on time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from the suppliers from the UK and the EU for cars made by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be a interruption at the border which can lead to the industry's delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep supplies longer than one day in his Derbyshire factory, they said from the company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We must have an agreement. We want to achieve the best agreement that will allow as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but also to grasp this opportunity," Radio 4 on BBC today said.
"The example is not only Toyote but also other producers that we must be absolutely able to continue what was an extremely successful series of supply chains."
Toyota could not tell how long the production would be suspended, but warned that in the long term additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory in the market and eventually reduce the number of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnastone for 24 years and the union president of the Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when such jobs are closed, they never return.
Government spokesman said: "We must put forward a precise and persuasive plan for our future relations with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, said from the White House.
Donald Trump's very important meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred for another week" because the fight on candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who explores the case of Russian involvement in the elections, links between Trump's assistants and Russia, and potential disruption by the president.
Whether Trump will fire a deputy general prosecutor or not, and thus jeopardize Mr. Mueller's independence, it's been the topic of speaking in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein also talked about the wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of the president's removal based on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein threw these rumors away.
But last Monday, he was at the White House, in the middle of a rumour he was going to resign.
Instead, Thursday was announced a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid overlapping with the hearing of the Senate Justice Commission on which he was witnessed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Trump ordered on Friday the FBI to conduct an inquiry against Kavanaugh in one week, further delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News channel.
Asking about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date has not yet been established, it could be this week, and it could be delayed by another week, considering all the other things happening about the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I like the press always to be informed."
Some journalists would deny this claim: Sanders has not made a brief address for journalists in the White House since September 10th.
Master Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the smaller number of brief addresses was not the result of refusal to "theatrical behavior" of TV journalists, even though she said, "I will agree with the fact that they exaggerate."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the journalists would be strengthened.
"The president has more sessions with questions and answers than any president before him," she said without stating evidence: "We have seen those numbers."
Short addresses will continue, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this as much as we can and you've seen us doing it for the past few weeks, and these talks with the President of the United States will replace short talks to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or at press conferences during his visit to officials.
Press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, acting in front of the crowded journalists unobservedly and occasionally strangely.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers working in the National Health Service (NHS) of Scotland on fears related to Brexit
The health secretary wrote to EU employees working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the state and the desire to remain after Brexit.
Member of the Scotland Parliament Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scotland government has already committed to remedy the costs of resolved EU citizens' status requirements working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "The retreat negotiations between the UK and the EU were resumed during the summer, and the decisions are expected this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this has been a very restful time for all of you.
Therefore, I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of his citizenship.
Coworkers from all over the EU, and wider, bring worthy experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare services, benefiting from patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergone emergency surgery after head injury
The defensive team player State Tigers Tennessee, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he injured his head in Saturday's defeat 31:27 from the Vanderbilt Commodores club, reported Mike the Tennessean Authority.
Chief Coach Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury happened just before half-time.
"He came to the field line and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carriage and took it to further questioning.
Officer from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV Nashville channel, Tennessee, that Abercrombie ended with surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details of the type/obsight of injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second-year student in red dress, plays the first season for Tennessee State after passing from Illinois.
He had five total blasts on Saturday before leaving the game, reaching 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign buyers will charge higher real estate fees in UK
More taxes will be charged to foreign buyers in UK, using additional funds to help homeless people according to new conservative plans
This move will neutralize Corby's success to attract young voters
More taxes will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The vault expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year -- to help homeless people
Foreign customers will charge higher fees for the purchase of real estate in UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will be announced today.
This step will be considered an attempt to neutralise the success achieved by Jeremy Corbyn in an effort to attract young voters to promise to ensure more accessible residential care and focus on those who earn more.
The higher taxes will be charged to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional money to strengthen the government's intention to fight sleep in the open.
An additional fee, which is next to the current tax, including higher levels, introduced two years ago to another real estate and buying for rent, could be up to 3%.
The vault expects this move to increase revenues up to 120m pounds per year.
13% of new-built properties in London are estimated to buy people who do not have a residence in the UK, which makes prices growing, and buyers who first buy real estate become more difficult to become housekeepers.
Many wealthy areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "towns of ghosts" due to a large number of foreign customers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a taxi reduction to help a lot of young people get to their first home.
He accused construction companies of holding high real estate prices buying the first occasion of land they do not use, and asked Mrs May to quit the quota for accessible houses as soon as possible to break the British "a disgrace of housing policy".
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and stopping any challenged deposits.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my prime minister's mandate to return the British dream -- that life of every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our bad housing market.
Britain will always remain open to people who want to live, work and build a life in it.
However, it can't be right that individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy houses as easily as the British are worth it.
The dream of ownership of the house has become too far for many people, and inhuman sleep in the open continues to be real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland"
Sunderland chief Jack Ross says his "end-ambition" is to be the manager of the Scottish team at a certain point.
Forty-two-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of returning to the life of the Northeast Club, currently third in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Prime Minister League last season.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I was in the B team and that was it," Ross told the Sportsound BBC Scotland show.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity would only be given if I were successful in running the club."
Ros's predecessors as Sanderland managers include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyett and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic club says he didn't feel trouble because he came after such great names to such a big club, after he refused the Barnsley and Ipswich Town offers.
"The measure of my success at this point will be "will I be able to return this club to the Prime Minister League?"
Judging from the structure and the prospects of this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Prime Minister League," he said.
"It is not an easy task to bring him there, but I think I will be able to consider myself successful only if I can get the club back where it belongs."
Ros was only in the third year of his manager's career, after the period he spent as assistant chief in Dambarton and 15 months spent as part of the coach staff of Harts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the fall into the third category, and St. Miren dragged from the edge of the fall to the lower league to the winner of the Champions next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled taking over the Allo club.
"I honestly believed that management was the right thing for me, more than playing.
It sounds strange because I wasn't bad, I made decent profits and enjoyed some solid successes.
But playing can be hard.
There's so much that you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure from work, but management just suits me.
I've always wanted to do management and now I'm doing it, in my whole adult life I've never felt more comfortable than I am now."
You can listen to the whole interview on Sunday 30 September on Scotland Radio from 12:00 to 13:00 per British summer time
Perfect time for a glass is Saturday at 5:30, revealing research
The summer heat wave increased the traffic of British pubs fighting for survival, but increased pressure on the chains of restaurants.
In the group of pubs and bars, sales growth was 2.7% in July, but restaurant traffic dropped by 4.8%, according to figures.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting company, who collected data, said: “The permanent sunny time and longer than the expected participation of England at the World Championship contributed to following a similar pattern in July as the previous month of June, when the pubs gained a 2.8% growth and restaurants had a even higher fall.
The loss of traffic in restaurants of 1.8% in June just got worse in July.
The pubs and bars focused on drinks have achieved far the best score with higher growth compared to the compared results from the previous period, than the decline in restaurant traffic.
The pubs focused on food also died because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The pubs and bars have increased the sale of drinks by 6.6% in a month, with a three-percent reduction in food sales."
Paul Newman, analyzed by the RSM entertainment and entertainment agency, said: “These results continue to be a trend we have witnessed since the end of April.
The weather opportunities and impacts of major social and sporting events remain the main factors when it comes to selling on the market outside the household.
It is not surprising to the fact that restaurant groups continue to fight hard, although the decline of sales of 4.8% per year will be particularly painful with already present price pressures.
A long hot summer could not come at a worse time for caterers focused on food, and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we had in August would provide a little over the necessary relief."
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slower introduction of new brands growth.

Every fifth child has a secret order on social networks that hides from his parents
Each fifth child, some aged only 11 years, has a secret order on social networks that hides from his parents and teachers, reveals research
A study encompassed by over 20,000 high-class students revealed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
This news has increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students said he had a "main" warrant showing parents
Every fifth child, of whom some are only 11 years old, makes orders on social networks that he hides from adults.
The study encompassed by 20,000 high-class high-school students revealed a rapid increase in "fake Insta" warrants, referring to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has strengthened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main" warrant showing their parents, but they also have private orders.
A mother who encountered her 13-year-old daughter's secret page revealed a teenager who calls other people with the words "rape me."
The survey conducted by the UK Digital Consciousness and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40% of children from 11 to 18 had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they had private orders.
President of HMC Mike Buchanan said: It upsets the fact that so many teenagers come into temptation to create space on the Internet where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "glass of athlete" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletical Committee as an incompetent director at the annual assembly of the governing body.
Doyle is the most rewarded Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described this move as a great opportunity for those leading sports to benefit from its rich experience gained internationally over the past decade
"Eilidh enjoys great respect for the athletic community in Scotland, UK and all over the world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its membership in the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
An American, who won a total of four Olympic goldes, including the 200-400-mt races in Atlanta in 1996, and now a regular expert at BBC, remained irreversible after he experienced a transient ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time can show if I can recover and how much.
It was a hard job, but I've fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agile exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertisement for a traitor in which mothers compare with cows shared opinions on the Internet
The company that produces traitors shared opinions on the Internet by breast-feeding advertising compared to cows of muzars.
In order to mark the launch of a product described as "first silent traitor", the Elvie consumer technology company published a commercial inspired by a fun music video showing the freedom the new pump provides to mothers who issue milk.
Four real mothers dance in a barn between hay and cows with a song, which says, "Yes, I am but I have no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, but it's not a vime, it's my breasts."
It follows: "Pump, pump, feed my babies, pump my babies, pump, pump myself, husband myself."
However, the commercial published on the Facebook page of the company caused controversies on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video triggered different viewers' reactions, while many said it was throwing light on the "uses" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product was a very bad decision.
And they must become pregnant and rode as we do to produce milk, but their babies are abducted several days after their birth," someone wrote.
Elvia Pump stands discreetly in breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “It is clear that it is both traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't you use them for a commercial of traitors to mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “The sayings made no sense. ”
Others stood in defending the advertisement, and one woman admitted that her song was "hysterical".
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy this if I were still breast-feeding.
Betrayal made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little silly, but I figured it out.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “This is a funny commercial focused on dairy moms (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like " cows".
This is not a commercial that praises or where the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all danced with discreet pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of advertisement is based on the knowledge that many mothers who betray milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely outrageous, there is no wire or pipe and stands in the breast-feeding bra, which gives women freedom to move, keep their babies, and even go out while they issue milk.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive creative director at the Mother Company, commented: “Pumpma Elvie is such a revolutionary product that deserves bold and provocative launch.
By pulling the parallel between breast-feeding and muscar cows we wanted to put into focus the issue of milk and all the challenges that go along with it, showing in a fun and understandable way the amazing sense of freedom that this new pump provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump got into the news titles.
During the week of fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the runway in the creation of Martha Jakubowska using this product.
Hundreds of migrants secretly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained children of migrants has increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to find child caregivers.
Traditionally, most guardians themselves were migrants without documents fearing to jeopardize their country's possibility of staying in the country by stepping forward to accept the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adult members of their household would have to give fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration services.
Matthew Albence, senior Immigration and Customs Service, told Congress last week that the service has arrested dozens of people who have applied for custody of minors without escorts.
The office later confirmed that 70% of the arrested were not previously convicted.
"Near 80% of people who are either guardians or household members are illegal in this country, and a good part of them are foreigners who committed crimes.
So we're going to continue looking for these people, said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to get the children through the procedure faster, officials introduced new rules that some of them would have to appear in court within a month of retention, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, the workers at the shelter said.
Many will take a video call instead of personally, so that the immigration judge asks for legality of their status.
Those who are determined not to comply with the conditions will be deported quickly.
The longer children remain imprisoned, the higher the chances of becoming anxious or depressed, which can lead to the outbreak of anger or attempts to escape, the workers of the hostels and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say that such risks are increased in larger institutions such as the one in the city of Tornillo, where the size makes it much easier to overlook signs that suggest that the child has problems.
They added that transferring children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet their friends can cause trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria seeks immediate retreat of US, French, and Turkish "occupational forces"
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return, although the war in the country has lasted eighth year.
Moualem, who is also at the post of deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegal in the Syrian country, under the excuse of fighting terrorism and "that they will be dealt with in an appropriate way".
They must withdraw immediately and unanimously," he said in the session.
Moualem insisted that in Syria "the war against terrorism is almost over", where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "the holy fight until we exterminate all Syrian terrorists", including terrorist groups and "every foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly responsible for training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in this country destroyed by war.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said there are good conditions for their return and blamed "any Western countries" to "expand irrational fears" that encourage refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to enable these returns," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance for the restoration of Syria until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last major rebel resort in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement has disrupted a major attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province living in three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action against the jihadists and fighters from the Nusra front connected with Al-Qaeda, will "be extinct".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to call the first meetings of the new committee consisting of the authorities and opposition members to draft a further constitution for Syria and prepare the way to the elections.
Moualem provided the terms of the Syrian government for participation in the work of the committee, saying that the work of the body should be limited to "inspect members of the current constitution" and warned of the possibility of external interference.
Why Trump will be selected for second term
According to this logic, Trump would be reelected in the 2020 election unless many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, revocation and scandal to interrupt his mandate earlier.
It would undoubtedly represent "the most dramatic ending of the presidential mandate of all time!"
So far, there are no indications of the horror of the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN channel and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on the MSNBC channel.
According to the Nielsen agency, Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the impact term, unlike four years ago when he had 1.7 million, and the show of Rachel Maddow Show MSNBC channels exceeded the rating of cable channels with 3.5 million viewers during the evening with impact news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer drama producer "Selected survivors" on the ABC channel, about the government secretary who becomes president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a long-term comedy writer and author of the book "Just funny parts: and several cruel truths about getting into the Hollywood boys club," has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked.
“ He said: “Because he makes me laugh, ” Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos has fun value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, stories coming from Washington can decide the future of the abortion law from the Roe v Wade process, whether immigrant families will be able to connect and what the state of global economy will be.
Turning off is a luxury that can afford only the most privileged viewers.
And yet, you went a little further than general information when you realized that you watched the panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of the "deep background" for his book "Strah", about Paul Manafort's jacket from the noum skin worth 15,000 dollars (a suit with a thick layer of brazenness), wrote Washington Post and the implications of picturesque descriptions, this, anatomy, Mr. Trumppa, given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, will never see Super Mary with the same eyes again.
"A part of what he makes you see him as a reality show is that he feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Pawnshow maker, commenting on the rotation of the acting station and everyday complications of Trump's show (criting the American Football League, bragging Kim Jong-Una).

When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny with a temperature of about 80 degrees (27°C), but he closed inside and watched MSNBC and recorded CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to face the Senate Justice Commission and his future in the Supreme Court was uncertain.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The large inflows of money on the side in the most unspecified middle-term election race for the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania county experiences a flood of money, thanks to the redistribution of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
The recent overlapping of the county borders in the suburbs of Pittsburgh led to the election of the Democratic Representative Conor Lamba, who headed the second county after the early elections last spring.
Lamb is fighting another current representative, the Republican of Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania county, which is largely overlapping with the new 17th county.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally formed in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th county has launched a fight to finance campaigns between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for a democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widespread special elections for the 18th congressional Pennsylvania district in March.
The position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point county.
Political analysts gave little advantage to Democrats.
The United States is considering punishing El Salvador for the support of China, but then withdraws
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with little incentives from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varel and had a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of diplomatic missions from EL Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because "the recent decisions to no longer recognise Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman of the Department, said in a statement earlier in the month.
But fines are only considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $1 140 million US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, including the reduction of financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would be difficult to hit this central-American country with a high unemployment rate and killings.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity that was supposed to be a continuation of a similar last year's gathering that was a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants in the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus actually discontinued any sanctions review for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for the middle of October, which is a sign of the importance that the administration is giving the meeting, diplomats said.
And three US envoys secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal debates provided they remain anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
Next thing you know, it could be a Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on a possible obstruction of Trump's judiciary, which now has significant evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller also directed his investigation to discover a possible connection between Trump's campaign and Russia's attack in the election.
If most people change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to re-enter voters, maybe even a jury.
It's a lot of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall, or those in Europe that are similar to him, is inevitable.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German soldiers were willing to strike against Hitler, only to oppose the West and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history turns around such fractures, and the relentless march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
Americans are now facing several breakpoints like that.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires deputy chief prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate of investigation?
Rosenstein has been in an unprecedented position since this paper reported last year that he has proposed a secret recording of the president and made speculation that he is not capable of performing his function.
Mr. Rosenstein says the deposition from the Times is incorrect.
"How will we react if a recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his candidacy for the Supreme Court is confirmed despite persuasive accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And on top of all, are we going to vote in the middle of a vote for the Congress that Mr. Trump will be held accountable?
If we fall into those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't believe we're going to fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia deported to Auschvic the same Nazi regime that once took over the country where I was the ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to burn candles for Sabbath on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
Rapidu from Vienna hosts on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians, after an impressive remy in Spain against Villarrel early this month, will be put in a good position to qualify from the G European League group.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance's collar player from debiting this season until the unsolved match with Vilareal final score 2-2, but he was convinced that the Rangers could use this result as a jumpboard for further.
"It was worth a point for us because Villareal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game by believing that we could achieve something and we left with a point.
We may have taken them to the end, but all in everything, the unsolved result is probably just.
They were probably better in the first half, and we got back in the second and we were better.
We have a big European evening coming up again on Thursday.
We hope we can take three points, but it's gonna be a tough match because they had a good score in the last game, though, with the support of the audience, we can certainly push and achieve a positive result.
Last year was undoubtedly difficult, starting with everything that happened to my injuries to change in the club itself, but now we're satisfied with what we have right now.
The team is in good shape and the boys really enjoy it; we train well.
I hope now we can continue, leave the season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep from worrying about pension savings
Despite the fact that the subjects had a clear idea of how they would want to take care of them, few have discussed it with members of their families.
About half of the people covered by the Nationwide research said they discussed long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10% of them said he talked to his children about it.
"People want someone from the family to take care of them, but they don't want to start a conversation on that subject," says Holly Snyder, vice-president of the life insurance sector at the Nationwide Company.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Co-operate with your advisor and your family and consider where and how to provide it, because such decisions can be a significant factor in determining the price.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor may also help you figure out a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term funding elections can include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own savings – provided you have enough money.
Fix your legal documents: Basically prevent legal battles.
Make the authority to make decisions on medical assistance in order to have an authorized person of trust that will control the medical care provided to you and ensure that healthcare professionals are in line with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the conclusion of a financial asset agreement.
That means you choose a person of trust who will make financial decisions on your behalf and take care of paying your bills if you remain powerless.
Remember the little details: Imagine your old parent finding himself in the situation that he needs medical attention and taking him to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not only about finances, it's also about who the doctors are?" Martin asked.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Plan it."
A man shot with multiple shots from an Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was shot with multiple shots from an air rifle while on foot coming home from an evening date.
The victim, in her 40s, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 according to British summer time, as "a random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called the witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have killed a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, officials said, and the number of dead are expected to grow.
As the connections broke, aid officers couldn't get any information from the Donggale province, areas north of Palua, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow cove on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck him.
Dongala is a district that extends more than 300 km (180 miles) of coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, which is administratively lower than the province, had an estimated population from 299/2013 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the basis for the economy of Central Sulawesi, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit the West Donggala in 1996 when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
These are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the Western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6.8 degrees hit the south of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, launching tsunamis that slap the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake struck the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the deadly earthquakes and tsunamis in 2004.
This time no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the destruction of buildings.
2018: The major earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, where more than 500 people lost their lives, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remain imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasil, Aljaska, was arrested on the grounds of suspicion that he committed violence in the family, impededed family violence and resisted arrest, according to a report released by the State Police Agency Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained at the Mat-Su detention unit and he was given a $500 parole bail, KTU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the issue of pleasing guilty declared "it is certainly not guilty," the network said.
Palin is faced with three class A violations, which means he's facing a prison sentence up to a year and a $250,000 fine.
He was also accused of a class B violation, which is punished by a prison sentence of one day and a fine of $2,000.
This isn't the first time they've filed criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska V.A.
In January 2016, he was charged with family violence, impediment of family violence and possession of alcoholic weapons related to the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after having linked her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit by the Sulawesi Indonesian island on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake that caused the tsunami destroyed hundreds of homes.
There has been an interruption of connections and electricity supply, and the number of dead in the coming days is expected to increase.
The earthquake epicenter was directly near the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social networks circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pala, when the tsunami sparked the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died -- a rare sentence for federal crime in the country has not been committed since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck of the company Home Depot to attack on the bike track along the West Side road in the Lower Manhattan, where he smashed the hikers and bicycles that were on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed eight victims and deliberately committed severe physical injuries, according to a request for a death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
By both of these points, a sentence of death is possible, according to the court's document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury accused Saipov of 22 counts of indictments including eight charges of murder and racketing, usually used by federal prosecutors in organised crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "destructive, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," said in the sentence request.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last had a case in which the death penalty was threatened.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last death penalty in a federal case in New York was committed in 1953 over Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 1953 on the electric chair.
According to the court documents, Saipov, a birth of Uzbekistan, has not shown repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out an attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to highlight the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty of 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were visiblely disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty, instead of accepting a lifetime prison without the possibility of pleasing guilt, will only extend the trauma of these events to all involved," Patton said.
Saip's defense had earlier asked the D.A. not to state the death penalty.
The conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the National Army" during a protest at a conservative conference.
The former UK Independence Party leader said politicians had to "feel the dissatisfaction" of euroceptics, as one of the Members of Therese May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the European Union.
The conservative representative Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have come out by now if Mr Farage had been Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced in an attempt to unite its deep-sized rows was highlighted by conservatives who advocated the stay in the EU and joined a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister tries to maintain its compromise plan from Chequers despite attacks and supporters and opponents of Brexit and the EU.
Allies insisted that it continues its attempts to make an agreement with Brussels despite the negative reactions, and force Euroceptics and Laboratorians to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the Otići meeting means to go to Solihull that he wants to "lodge Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should get a title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd have been out by now," he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our laws to our country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
The supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins who also attended the event told reporters: "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the wider public, the opposition will not vote for him, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
"Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening."
In a harsh message to Mrs May, she added: “The prime ministers manage to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the crowds that politicians must be forced to "feel dissatisfaction" if they are willing to fail the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us -- the people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to play Brexit, and we're here today to tell them "that won't pass."
In the message of enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the betrayal of Brexit, to feel displeased.
"We are mobilizing the national army of this country that has brought us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, supporters marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A few activists waved with the "Torians against Brexit" transparency after forming a group this weekend.
The Labourist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they had with the party's application to open the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canadian Plus Plan, for the undisturbed state of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
Good Brexit is not possible," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after the order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel.
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the order of teams would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the beginning and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and urged Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel went first to boxing and left Hamilton behind to get involved in traffic at the beginning, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered a boxing round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the action wheel of the wheel that the Ferrari driver unintendedly forced to leave free internality with the risk of delay after a double move in the defense of the third bandage.
Max Verstappen started from the last row of bars and was seven at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led most of the race relying on his tires to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth place.
He finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but he failed to speed up the pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It's been a hard day because Walteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's been a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a really remarkable job to achieve a one-two formation final," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinsten at a rally on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release a letter to the public by Christine Blasey Ford in which candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh accuse of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in west virginia, the president wasn't directly testifying to Ford's press conference before the Senate Justice Committee, but commented on what's going on in the Senate showing that people are mean, miserable, lying.
The only thing that could have happened and the wonderful thing that happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and vicious and lying, he said.
When you look at the publications and the information that went public, and then they say "Oh, I didn't do it."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release information to the public?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the press-- whatever?
Oh, no.
I didn't let it go public."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we let... No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Ford sent a letter in July with details of Ford's claims against Kavanaugh, and it leaked in early September -- yet Feinsten denied that the information was leaked from her office.
I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not release her story to the public," Feinstein told the board, reports Hill.
She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it in secret, as she asked."
But her denial didn't come upon the approval of the president, who at a rally on Saturday nights commented, "To tell you, it was really a bad speech of the body.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Proceeding to defend his candidates for the Supreme Court, whom three women have been accused of sexual abuse, the president has insinuated that Democrats are using this for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power at all costs.
You see malice, misery, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," Mediaite quotes the president.

Air traffic controller lost his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid an earthquake.
Air traffic controller in Indonesia declared a hero after he died ensuring a secure flight with hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died, and many have disappeared after a strong earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, starting tsunamis.
Strong subsequent earthquakes continue to affect this area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues escaped trying to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace at the control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Palu airport, which swinged strongly.
He remained to ensure the safe launch of Batika Air Flight 6321, which at the time stood on the runway.
When he realized the control tower collapsed, he jumped off him.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said his decision might have saved hundreds of lives, reports ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpano to Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Paluo.
Our heart is breaking because of this news," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims could reach thousands, while the State Agency for Disorder Dust Devil states that access to the towns of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
The number of victims is believed to continue to grow since the number of bodies are still under the ruins, and many cannot be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters devastated the Pala in which a mass burial will be held on Sunday.

Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to provide assistance to the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there."
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Idonezian President Joko Widododo arrived in Pala on Sunday and sent word to the army of the state: I ask all of you to work daily on the execution of all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN report.
Indonesia hit an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports that after the plane falls into the lagoon one face is run missing.
The airline whose airplane crashed in a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia states that one person is being run missing, after it announced earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sunk.
Air Niugini said since Saturday afternoon they were unable to trace the passenger.
The airline says in co-operation with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they work to find this man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew members after the plane fell into the water trying to land at the island airport Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday seven people were transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six other passengers were detained in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
Still unexplained what caused the fall and exactly what happened.
And the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane ended up in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some eyewitnesses think the plane flew the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
It's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to get through the escape in case of danger through the water that swinged them to the waist in the plane that sunk.
He said the crew was panicking and yelling, and he suffered a head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on repairing the port also helped to save the boat to the drum that drove the passengers to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Air Niugini did not participate in the accidents of the airlines registered in the PNG in the past two decades.
The analyst reconstructs the following events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution ended on Saturday in a re-processing against the man accused of burning a living woman in Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst of the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
In front of a jury, he said he was using cell phone records to make a picture of the movement of the defendant Quinton Tellis, 29 years old, and the victim of Jessica Chambers, 19 years old, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data with a few phones that indicate that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his earlier claims, the Clarion Ledger quoted.
When the data showed that his phone was in the same place as Chambersin at the time he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday that he was out of town that day.
Asking the prosecutor if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanfrod said he lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that Chambers met about two weeks before her death.
The cell phone records suggested they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett was that Tellis had taken some time after Chambers' death from his phone wiped out her messages, calls and contact information.
He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should start on Sunday with the final word.
The judge said he expects a jury trial to take place later this day.
The High Breed: What's a bright hip-hop?

The High Breed from Bristol claims that the hip-hop has moved away from its beginnings when he was dealing with political messages and social topics.
They want to return to their roots and regain popularity to a bright hip-hop.
Artists like the Fugees and the Common regain popularity in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
The New York nanny's suing a couple for firing after a racist text message.
New York's nanny sues a couple for dismissal on a discrimination basis after mistakenly receiving a text from a mother who complains that she's another black person."
A couple deny they're racist, assessing the lawsuit as extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when she arrived on the first working day of 2016, realized that the new nurse, Giselle Maurice, a black girl.
NEE another nigger," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, Mrs Maurice sent it twice.
When she became aware of her gaff, Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was an African-American, was badly doing her job and that she expected a Filipine instead, New York Post quoted her as saying.
Mrs. Maurice got a one-day fee and she was sent home.
Maurice now prosecutes a couple asking for compensation for dismissal, as well as a fee of 350 dollars per day in six months, to which she was originally hired to live with her family, although without a contract.
I want to show them, you see, you can't do such things," she told Post on Friday, adding that I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the racist charges that the cancellation of Maurica's engagement was reasonable because they feared that after insulted her they would not be able to trust her.
My wife sent her something she wouldn't say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Post husband Joel Plasco told.
But would you trust your children with someone you offended, even if it was done by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Validating the lawsuit as extortion," Plasco said his wife only received two months of maternity leave and had been in a very difficult situation."
You're going to pursue someone like that?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still under way, the public court was quick to condemn money on social networks, criticising them for such behavior and thinking.
Paddington publishers feared that the readers would not match the bear that speaks, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says about the letter, "It's hard to put in the position of someone who reads it for the first time before publication.
It is very interesting to know what we now know about Paddington's success."
Saying that her father, who, before the little stuffed bear inspired him to write a book for children, would work for BBC as a cameraman, still be positive if his work was rejected, added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled and happy and sad after his death last year.
She also added that her father was secretly proud of Paddington, whom she described as a very important member of our family."
He was such a man, he did not like to brag," she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like your child accomplished something and you're proud of him, even though it's not really your credit.
I think he's at the success of Paddington looking in some way like that.
Although he was the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
Her daughter was immediately transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought for nothing to save her life.
Nad regularly called to say it was bad, and they did not expect to survive," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called me to say that she's gonna die in the next two minutes and that I have to say goodbye to her.
I did it, too.
I said, Tashi, I love you, sweetheart.
And I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping blood slowly stopped working and no longer running through her bloodstream.
She died just a few moments before that, and everything went off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing what's next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be gathered."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was sad about her daughter's death, boarded a plane along with other passengers, who never dreamed of what trouble she was going through.
Nobody knew," she said.
I shove my head down, and my tears kept flowing down my face.
It's hard to explain, but during the summer, I was overwhelmed by my sympathy for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad women leave messages to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones killed themselves want to prevent others from taking their own life.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humpreyes on the Welsh Bridge are putting cards with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression to commit suicide at 18 years of age.
I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a prospective chef with a contagious laughter.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
However, before his death he left his job because he was in a very dark phase."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11, was the one who found his brother after committing suicide in 2014.
Mrs. Davis says, "I keep worrying that it will leave the consequences."
Mrs. Davis designed those cards so that people would know that there's someone you can talk to and who you can talk to, even if that's just a friend.
Don't sit down and shut up - talk."
Mrs. Humpreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
He didn't say he was indisposed, depressed or anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
On Christmas he was at the very bottom - when the children opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything else."
She says that his death for them was a huge trauma, but that they must cope with it: it leaves an enormous void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we will continue and fight."

With the opening of the FBI investigation, the future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain.
I thought if we really managed to get something out of what he was looking for -- an investigation of limited duration and circumstance -- maybe that would unite us some," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he fears the board is falling apart" due to unrelenting party views.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their unwillingness was caused by the choice of a moment.
The Congress elections are only five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans go badly, their attempts to be elected to the highest court in the country will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush phoned the senators on Saturday, lobbying for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the feds draft their own report?
It will vote in the Senate, where 51 Republican and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavnaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice-President Mike Pence to decide and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kima.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling on South Korea's United Kingdom Ministry data, Park Byeong-seug said 1127 refugees were recorded last year compared to 2011 when the number was 2706.
Mr. Park said that two decisive factors are stronger border control between North Korea and China and the larger tariffs that trafficking people charge.
Pyongyang didn't go public.
The large majority of North refugees are eventually offered citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Korean citizens have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest line with South Korea and is easier to cross than a firmly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China is viewed as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often returns them back.
Relations between the North and the South -- which are technically still in the war -- have been significantly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang primarily to discuss stopped talks on denuclearisation.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where a wider agreement was reached to work on denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress so far.
Without confidence in the United States there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we do not disarm ourselves first unilaterally," the RI said in his address at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh hysterical," saying it was incompatible for the service in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at the House of Representative Nancy Pelosi called the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh hysterical" and said that because of his temperament, he was unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever felt hysterical like that," Pelosi said for her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at the time they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and hugging when he talked about his family and his high school age,
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, assessing the allegations against him by a grotesque and orchestrated attack on his personality" organised by liberals to anger that Hilary Clinton lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he can't hold office in the Supreme Court since it demonstrated his bias against the democracy.
I believe he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he went against Clinton's and Democrats," she said.
Asked if he would try to revoke Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get most in the House of Representatives, Pelosi rebuked.
I'll tell you the next: If he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's not just like being in the Supreme Court, but in any court he's in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently the judge of the District Court of Appeal of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about any Kavanaughi verdicts against the Act of Accession for Health, or in the case of Roe v. Wade, as they consider him a conservative judge.
At the hearing for his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided to answer questions about whether to modify certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for hysterical, biased person to be put into court and we are expected to say, is it not wonderful," Pelosi said.
And women have to deal with it.
A justifiable anger, anger that has been gathering for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without pay.
We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, what do you say?"
She continued: I was very helpful by a woman who was a CEO somewhere, and who said that she was crying when she was angry, but that she developed a technique that drew up that when she was angry and started crying, the person she was talking to says you might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
And I thought she was great."
Tears are allowed to expel anger partly and because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of the previous work, in the office where most men were, is how, once when I cried because of an indescriptive anger, an older woman -- a cold boss I've always been a little afraid of -- grabbed my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
I never let them see me crying," she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be pleased because they think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
When in 1987 Hart was caught in an alien affair on the Moneky Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply frustrated, she discovered that there was no reason not to consider the idea that she was running for president herself.
That was not exactly a well-considered decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it Snow and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign was already out of the way, she was behind the fund collection, so she vowed she wouldn't get into the race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men a thousand dollars would give her only $250.
Do they think I have a discount?" She wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to collect funds and target voters instead of their representatives, and with anger for Шоvinism -- from which she got caught up in her throat.
You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder remembered how the press reacted to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they might put on my monument.
She cried?"
How the trade war between the United States and China can be good for Beijing
The first canonates of the US-China trade war were depreciating, and while the end of the battle is still in sight, the separation between countries in the long term could be useful for Beijing, the experts argue.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest blow this week took place with the new tariffs that hit 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), which are practically taxed by half of all the goods coming from China in the United States.
Beijing has always responded to the same measure, and the latest five to ten percent tariffs on US goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has vowed that the United States will respond with the same measure, and the second largest world economy seems to not stop soon.
To force Washington to retire means meeting demands, but the public worship of the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays well his next move, US pressures in the trade war can long-term positively support China by reducing each other's dependence on the two economies.
The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the beginning of a steep economic fall in one of these two countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," Abigali Grace, an explorer focused on Asia in the New American Security Centre.
Syria is ready to return refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says she is willing to return refugees voluntarily and appeals to help restore the country devastated by war for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
Today the situation in the field is much more stable and safer thanks to the progress made against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the area that has been destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said Syrian regime would benefit from helping restore the devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept the conditioned assistance or the assistance of the countries that helped the rebellion.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10,5 on the field Le Golf National van Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil so far and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe recovered the crown while the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn won 14,5 points that they needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during the entire tournament, put a ball in the water with the initial blow on the 16th hole of a pair of 3, leaving the match to Francescu Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shaved in all rounds, and became one of the four players who ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1997 tournament began in this format.
The American Jordan Speith lost with 5-4 of Throbjorn Olesen from Denmark, the lowest ranked European team player.
The world's best ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost two to one of Ian Poulter from England, who may have been the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the best European winner of all time's tournament with 25,5 points in his career.
I usually don't cry, but I couldn't help myself today.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we won the cup again.
There is an important team here and I'm glad I could be helpful," Emotive Garcia said after European victory.
He teaches his countryman John Ram who beats the legendary American golf player Tiger Woods 2 to 1 in individual matches on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this man," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistics for one of the best players of all times who won 14 largest titles and behind Jack Nicklaus only.
The American team spent the weekend trying to find a way to the hole, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf during the whole tournament.
After his team's disappointing performance, the American captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, there were moments when we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder Cup and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to admit who's better.
We're high."
