He's a living being, so of course he's full of shit.
Tom can write nicely.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom's going to get better.
Tom works in marketing.
They're a quintet of lime tobacco instruments.
I don't care if our team wins or not.

What are you doing?
Did I call you?
We won't let you die.
What can I say?
I'm a little beaten.
You can't sit with me.
She keeps begging that she doesn't have time.
Have you seen Tom leave?
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
It's hard for me to understand French when they speak fast.
She didn't even blink.
What did all that mean?
You can't make us leave.
I made the first step.
Everyone smiled.
It would mean to me if you could do that to me.
You're sad.
Tom worked hard to get the job done on time.
I gave them some food.
You disappointed me.
It's not a big deal.
How much will I take?
I'm teasing you.
If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head, if you speak to him in his tongue, it goes to his heart.
We're not done yet.
I want to see you behind bars.
Let's go to the bar now.
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Are you sarcastic?
Let's try this one.
Can I talk to you alone?
Did you see the sunrise?
She put a ring on her finger.
He's as intelligent as his brother.
Tom's on a business trip.
I still can't remember where I left my keys.
Where did you get that scar?
You wouldn't have thought about her appearance, but the story of the child who ate two cakes is from her childhood.
I can't live such a life.
Tom's hungry like a wolf.
It was a tough decision.
Everyone's crying.
Oktopod Pole was right.
He loves soccer.
What are you doing down here?
I'm not ready yet.
Do you skip breakfast in the morning?
The Norwegian diplomat was hostile toward the Soviet Union, so the KGB launched a compromise action against that Norwegian man, and he had a Russian girl, and he was asked to leave the country immediately.

Do you think games and learning are compatible?
I think that's totally funny.
Leila has a wide circle of friends.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What's your age of car?
Account, please.
Make sure the cat's out there and the doors are locked when you leave.
Stays to see if I can get there on time.
I could lose my job.
Forget Tom.
I work as a free translator.
Tom got his fingers on the table nervously.
Did you go out last night?
I have a game to play with.
That's what a doctor needs.
I like instrumental music.
You should thank Tom with a letter.
I'm blind.
What can't you tell me?
What were his first words?
Just be quiet, please.

Are you involved in this?
I thought it was terrible.
Forget I said that.
I failed.
Tom wants to work at the same hospital where Mary works.
I'd like to be as rich as Tom.
Another store's about to open up in Boston.
I was shocked.
Tom's a good-looking man.
Tom told me this morning that he and Mary were moving to Boston.
Can you save me a few cookies?
I have milk allergies.
Do you know what this sentence means?
I ate a box of chocolate.
Tom's a real nerd.
Eat soup while it's hot.
I won't let this go.
Let me help you avoid some problems.
I've never tried to do this before.
Did I drop that?
Mary can't stand Tom's boss because she's a chauvinist pig.
I've been everywhere in europe.
Are you coming soon?
It's a harmless lie.
What would I get from this?
Mini skirts are back in fashion.
Thanks for the paperwork.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Tom doesn't care what I do.
If you need help, tell me.
I've been looking for you.
I have no high opinion of him as a musician.
Tom's been shot.
Did you tell Tom this?
Everyone's talking.
They're all sick.
My father said no.
A lot of people pray before they eat.
Where did she go?
I think you'll be able to do that.
And who are you?
Keep working.
They have improved security procedures and are now better prepared than before.
It's empty.
Honestly, I'm not even sure I'm right.

The music started again.
I don't think you should tell Tom that.
I'll call.
The girl let the birds out of the cage.
Does any of your friends play the guitar?
I thought you couldn't do that.
He got what he wanted.
Tom was afraid of snakes earlier.
That might not be easy.
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I've passed every test.
I'm sick of your whining.
There's only one way out.
What brother did you see?
I'll take a look.
Now he's very busy.
I'm not sure Tom wants to talk to me.
Should the Scotland become an independent country?
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Don't open the window.
I believe in Kayla Min of June 12, 1998.
You're very rude.
I went to bed yesterday without brushing my teeth.
Danger lurks on every corner.
When I went to high school, I got up at 6 every morning.
You're becoming reckless.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
You never let me do anything.
Tom had a rotten summer.
Come run with me.
Drive faster.
You're very helpful, Tom.
Contact Tom.
What we had was special.
You should write a novel.
You can't get away from the past.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Tom's holding on to him.
I hope I find Tom.
Tom didn't want to write about what happened.
I'm sure Tom didn't want to hurt you.

I wrote some songs last week.
What am I doing here?
Do you have a dog?
They're gonna be okay.
The family had dinner at noon.
I thought you were going to the Boss bus.
They're cleaning up my room.

Don't stop.
I always thought it was weird.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.

I love watching you dance.
I'm really proud of Tom.
We have to work hard.
You're very pretty.
Please be honest with me.
I'm really looking forward to being here.
I cannot answer your question with any certainty.
God forbid!
None of us saw Tom do it.
Let's talk options.
I was just about to suggest that you do it.
She decided to go to the U.S. study.
It was really inspiring.
Tom has three grown-up sons.
Take my ticket.
You still want to do this?
So, what do we do?
This is my third marriage.
Next time, I'm sure it'll be better.
The text is highly processed.
We're all trying to win.
Check around.
This box is almost empty.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Nothing can stop us.
Tom didn't offer to pay.
I could go with you.
I don't know who they are.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
I'll try to find them.
Hey, give me a chance.
Tom, are you and Joem brothers?
Have fun while you can.
Is that love?
Today, the ship was above the Middle Atlantic Reef -- a mountainous venue located at the bottom of the ocean, at the depths of up to 4500 meters.
Yeah, I love that!
It was a little uncomfortable.
Do you have a copy?
When exactly did you do that?
I watched Tom die.
Do you have a blog?
Parliament is dissolved.
I hope that's not true.
Are you done already?
Tom would never agree with that.
You look like a very intelligent person.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
She got up and approached the window.
It was something that led to a spark of new ideas.
We'll visit you from time to time.
I'm in your hands.
I met some of Tom's friends yesterday.
Think about it again.
It's heavy.
Tom was very nervous.
I've never regretted it.
She was intruding.
It's gotten dark.
We'd better tell the others.
Tell me about your teacher.
I always think about it.

I wasn't worried about that.
What was I supposed to do?
Dinner at seven.
Pua sang in church.
Everyone was sitting at the table.
Students didn't know how to answer.

Tom seems a little squeamish.
It's started.
I'm proud of this team.
I'm still here.
Tom's singing.
Don't laugh.
Did you tell Tom this?
You'll destroy your vision if you keep playing games.
I'm a Earthman.
I can read different foreign languages, but I don't speak any.
Who wants to talk to me?
Bad things are going to happen.
Say hello to your friends.
You still don't know how to drive?
I forgot.
It'll take some time to get used to it.
I'll be there.
We don't want to slide.
You're kind of right.
Although I told Tom not to open the door, he opened it.
Go straight.
It's just as simple as beans.
I've done a lot of good work.
Tom's playing with his son.
I'm leaving school.
We'll visit you sometime.
The distance between my house and your house is two kilometers.
You're wasting your time.
That says a lot about you.
I think it was deliberate.
It's not working too hard!
I'm proud of this team.
He accelerated.
Try this.
No consequences.
Say hello to your friends.
Tom's going to go.
Is any of this real?
What are you going to do today?
He's a man with tradition.
Do you have a paper I can write on?
Is it true that Tom won the race?
Can I hear another one?
I'd really like to see you again.
Let's sit down for five minutes.
What a question!
You're very brave, aren't you?
Tom seemed angry.
I've never noticed that before.
It's probably better not to eat after 7:00 a.m.
I'm sure Tom's proud.
Are they in love?
Help me.
Which way are you going?
I like sleeping on a soft bed.
Stay positive.
Everything's fine with my hearing.
I just want to get home.
You were right to brie.
How much money do we need?
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Tom lives downtown.
Don't be presumptuous.
Things are so different now.
I'm curious.
Tom grabbed a cab to the hospital.
I really like your music.
There's no business here.
Can you please tell me how to get to the airport?
I'm excited about this.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis game.
You're infectious.
We need your help.
Has Tom been informed?
Tofu goes well with Sake.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
I don't feel like swimming.
She's as beautiful as her mother.
You got a point.
I've lived a long time.
Give us some space.
It's not standing.
Enough, Tom.
Tom was going to ask his boss for a raise, but he changed his mind.
Come on in.
You won!
That's what both of them like.
Tommy said I shouldn't talk to Mary.
I keep saying that.
Most scientists rejected the continent movement theory, because it was so hard to imagine that the panel movements were even possible.
How did I miss that?
What did you tell Tom?
It was a bad situation.
Give them as much food as they need every day.
Tom's gonna change.
I acted instinctively.
That's what you have to do somewhere else.
Don't push.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
How often do you get videos on YouTube?
Do you know who Tom killed?
Everyone knows.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
It's not that easy.
I'm deeply ashamed.
I'm not upset anymore.
Have you fully recovered?
Tell Tom to come here.
It's raining hard.
Tom's sick today.
That's what both of them like.

Tom almost got caught.
They're the ones who want to leave.

What does the doctor think is wrong with your shoulder?
Come on in.
We're in a difficult situation.
It's just a personal opinion.
I just don't know what to say.
I'm just very grateful.
You've got it all wrong.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom's kissing bad.
Start counting.
You can never come back.
He's a man of blood and flesh with all his flaws.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Come tomorrow.
He ended up in prison.
How much money do we need?
Don't drink water.
I will always remember your advice.
She wanted me to come.
Tom saves money so he can go to Boston.
Say hello to your friends.
What do you think this sentence means?
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your ticket?
I'm sorry, I didn't show up.
Tom knows the procedure.
If a man advances in front of a woman, it's called favorization, if she's promoted, in front of a man, it's called equality.
Are you dyslexic?
Come back in an hour.
Tom often uses that word.
Tom was staring at his feet.
Are you still jealous?
How is this your fault?
I'm sure Tom would rather stay.
Tom's getting sick.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
You're the reason I came here.
That's what we are.
He's a biologist.
That was a little weird.
Shut that dirty mouth.
Show me the papers.
I still mourn the death of my eldest son.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
Are you going back now?
She must be over 60 years old.
Did you eat anything?
I've been there before.

I'm on Tom's side.
They almost caught an ancestor a few times.
I love this song.

Platon is a friend, but the truth is a bigger friend.
You're lying!
Even a kid knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a moller.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved a dog very much.
You're right.
They can never accomplish it differently than by force.
I thought I'd have another chance for that.
He'll understand.
That's not why I'm here.
I assumed you were busy.
She finally fell asleep.
Tom's laughing, Mary.
It's almost half three.
I don't know if it'll be enough money for me.
Can you pull the curtains?
Have you ever tried it?
That seems inhuman to me.
Did you have lunch?
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What is that, little kitty?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he had his belt tied.
It seemed yellow.
I'm celebrating.
I'm firm against compromise.
Everything has its price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
We've never been here.
I knew you couldn't do that.

What kind of problems do you have?
How would you feel if you were abandoned by a woman?
Everyone laughed.
I'm lying.
Tom's in a meeting.
Don't fight.
Just be careful, Tom.
I'll figure it out.
I'm in better shape than you.
Maybe they're around the lake somewhere.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's out of shape.
I don't have enough time to explain that to you.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's exactly what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
It was a crazy year.
Get the fuck out of here, Tom.
It's impossible to say with certainty.
Tom never left his home before.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's only been one day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
What's your story?
Begin.
It's going to take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
This knife is not sharp.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom knew French.
These are my best friends.
I swim in the ocean.
Did you see Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
I looked around.
One senator called the president of another country, an old intelligence officer who would like to restore the old empire of the country.
Would you like some more tea?
Exer's busted the tire.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
Don't stand.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?

Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
Sami was Layla's dance partner.
A little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.

No doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
Tom's still frustrated.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet astas are the kind of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
"You learn from your mistakes" and "The experience is the best teacher," they say, but on long paths even the best teacher angry, if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Share the tickets, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
You really don't have to do that.
I hope it's dry time.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches next day?
I know him well.
Are they in love?
No one knows what's going on behind those doors.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of stuff.
I'm just not so happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
It's very hard for me to trust anyone.
In our world education is disappointing.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Mario bought a microscope.
I've never camped.
I only listen to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was being persecuted by nightmares.
I've made my decision.
Thank you so much!
That won't have any effect.
Don't blink.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
I'm the person responsible.
Add more water.
What Tom suggests could save us all time.
Beautiful!
He's pretty busy right now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
They're all the others.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.
It's hard to give up long-term love from one.
Tom likes extreme sports.
Strong commitment to the environment is not compatible with major oil and gas investments.
I have a white horse.
Let's talk about this during lunch.
Say hello to your friends.
How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?
Tom hates strangers.
We need to respect personal rights.
What's that thing with your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anybody want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a funny mistake.
What are you guys eating anyway?
Don't talk.
Call him what you like.
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to, but he failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
It didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too loud for me here.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
Tom wrote a long letter to Mary, but he didn't send it to her.
He's got a good memory.
Cold limbs thorn.
Tom's not very nice.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come play with us.
Did you know Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
Tom arrived this morning.
Now he's pretty busy.
Here's some good news.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
Tom never said anything about it.
Don't stretch out.
Tom never asked why.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
Did I ask you?
I've seen a lot for now.
Turn around!
It took four kilos of gold to golden the winning medals.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to add numbers to his head.
Take care of me, and I'll look after you.
You have to trust me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Are you familiar with a touching man?
Will you talk to Tom about me?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everyone says that.
Speak plainly.
We're here to play golf.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one is unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
You'll need it later.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income's down by ten percent.
It may be difficult to visit an unknown field.
They're willing to talk about the problem.
Finally!
Tom appreciates modern art.
After my long deliberation, I eventually did things by chance.
It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does that happen a lot?
We're cutting down.
Can you talk to me?
Lower the TV.
I wear short sleeves in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.
Where's Avis the locker?
Tom could tell us how to do this.
I'm just leaving.
She spends three bucks a day for lunch and dinner.
See you in your dreams.
Come here.
I'll be home tomorrow.
I think you're stupid about that.
I've seen enough for now.
I feel bad because I lied.
They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.
Tom's going to remember.
Why doesn't he just tell Tom?
If there's no porn with it, the porn will be made with it.
Canada is a land-mother hockey on ice.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom saves money so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can do it if you try it.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
This is, without any doubt, an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I shouldn't have said that.
She jogs every morning before breakfast.
It leads to the city this time.
I'm not happy with that.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a big fight.
Stop watching TV and start learning.
We don't know our neighbors.
The police found stolen money.
I've never seen it before.
I got here a few minutes before you.
I didn't do it either.
How much is a bottle of beer?
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
What a pity!
I'm done fighting.
I have plenty of room.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
I try to be careful.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
I'm convinced.
Music is important to me.
Do you have your favorite?
Please come.
Take it easy!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else in the room with him.
Better merciful than by force.
There's trouble waiting for you.
There is no word "freedom" in Russian.
I thought you'd be busy.
Could that be true?
Just be quiet, Tom.
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
What are you gonna do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Ammonia is a base.
Check it again.
Are you honest?
That made sense to me.
Tell me what I have to do.
I've been told nothing.
Tom didn't make friendships as easy as Mary.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Bad weather stopped me from leaving.
Tom bought the papers.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
What's this?
Tom's asleep again.
Don't move!
Tom's only talking to Mary.
The first lesson is easy.
You're getting fat real fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
I can do a lot of things at the same time.
No one's as fast as you.
I agreed to buy that.
Am I the only one who's going to the party?
I really hope you're kidding.
Please be honest with me.
Are you sarcastic?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't get in that room.
It's all here.
Tom and Mary made a mistake about that.
I'm not as tall as you are.
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have gotten involved in your silly business.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom's savings to buy a yacht.
Everyone but Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
I had nothing to do with them.
I'm Klaustrophobic.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road connection to Oslo and Eastern Norway for the entire Western region.
You let me down.
I am truly happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I have something in mind.
Where did you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom managed to find Mary's house without any difficulty.
It's not easy sports.
I'm just not gonna do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
It's their right to vote.
Tell me where you are.
Are we going to see Tom again?
My mother cooks for me.
I try to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I listened to music.
Are you involved in this?
I must have ate something bad.
We're leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Avoid addicts on the color dilutor.
I liked that one.
Do you like roller-bones?
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend a meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom so much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy hanging out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I don't think anyone knows.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom was spinnin' around the room, not able to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come over sometime?
She wonders how that's possible.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You picked a nice one.
Look at the size of it!
Mary is the wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having a hard time talking about my feelings.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will be here.
You should come home.
Alice smiled.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger moves, creating music that is very pleasant to listen.
Strong winds broke a lot of branches from the trees last night.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
The way to a man's heart leads over his stomach.
It's time to get up.
The house is built by brick.
I didn't write this.
I can't feel partially responsible.
People have been good to me.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
I could come with you.
Take some.
Come in.
You really don't have to do that.
I wonder what Tom is planning to do.
To extend to the choir, it's necessary to learn to read notes.
Tom's asleep.
They wanted an apology.
What did I do wrong?
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you later.
Why me?
Tom's cooking for us.
We live in a house.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do it.
The zoo is closed on Monday.
That's the point.
Knowing foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It's very natural for a human being to always prevail in the interests of others.
It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of planned things for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
Why are you still awake?
I was at school yesterday.
Tom's doing what he's told.
I'm still working.
Stupid, insensitive children can sometimes grow into sociopaths.
I'd like her to be with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you hand me the remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
We all work too hard.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She's not familiar with the hatred of others.
This will make the job much easier for us.
He loves football.
The monks could play tennis in monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
Drive to work from an hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will be here soon.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do it.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
He's here.
I'll make something up.
Play it again, Sam.
Some of us feel that such views are pure madness.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any of the letters to Mary until he was away.
We've had enough of you.
We all know Tom is guilty.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom pulled the fatter ending out.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
When I woke up this morning, I felt mild nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
Come play with us.
And it was only with great pain.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Did you write the number?
That's not the reason for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Look into this.
My future is in your hands.
He's a fake, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him a day earlier.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think it's really important.
It's so sad.
How clever!
In a short matter of fact, I disagree.
I'm responsible.
You're not dating anyone, are you?
I used to play the piano a long time ago, so I still know a little bit.
Is this your glass, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Mother and daughter represented two generations.
He drew himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
They bow apples and pears, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
I really like practicing.
I'm really proud of that.
We were in the last place.
I contributed.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Isn't that black?
You're right.
Come, sit next to me.
Let's not talk about this right now.
Time to split up.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
The meeting execution is ready.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you even eating?
I don't like being judged.
I have a meeting tonight.
A man hopes as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss options.
That was a funny movie.
Bitcoin was encrypted.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom's gonna take care of this.
Go and take a look.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Or remember the one she sent you when you asked her to give you the pictures of Epldeck's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write the criticism of Mac's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent the criticism of Mec." "Yes." "What did you say you learned from it?" "I realized that Philips' screwdriver was convincing, but not misleading; and that Rerittie was a heavily charging things that I think should do as a friend."
I've always liked horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I miss that?
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It's better to live one day like a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I will do it with pleasure.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom's waiting.
Students didn't know how to answer.
I'm not a nightbird.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's going to call.
He lighted the torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
Tom will understand.
Those girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth about what Tom says.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make way.
The horse must have tripped and the knight has fallen from a horse.
I'm looking into it right now.
She's accomplished her goal.
Tom can do as he will, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what both of them like.
We sat together quietly for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes on a train.
Two sides are going to hold speeches this week.
I plan on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Why did you shave your beard?
Tom's not a good writer.
I've never noticed that before.
We know who he is.
I need a cab.
I saw the cat.
I'm in a gypsy.
Mom just went shopping.
I'm always nervous about passport control.
That one needs help.
Defend yourself.
He grabbed a cab to the hospital.
Do you know how to joggle?
Don't touch the lion while he's sleeping.
Tom's unfit.
Could it be alive?
Did you just meet him?
Honestly, I don't know.
Those are your choices.
It's safer.
Tell me about your teacher.
I saw the dog.
Maybe she has other plans?
The patient expired.
Thank you all for that.
I don't see anything suspicious.
Am I that different?
Whose handwriting is this?
Feels good.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Let's have lunch here.
I'll find the money somehow.
I shot a bear.
I'm sad I'm leaving.
The eagle is the bird's Emperor.
The fire took the first floor.
Tom was very happy when his team won.
They have decided to be married.
What did you two do?
I'm afraid you misunderstood this.
I was adopted.
We have direct access to the information.
I'm punished.
The cat was lying tainted all the length on the sunlight that penetrated through the window.
Walk or bike to school?
Tom is not much happier.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I'm proud of our team.
Only Tom and Mary were saved.
I'm done.
I wasn't very impressed with that.
I left Tom in 2013.
Mary knows that her main weapon, beautiful face and young body, is a passing value.
I saw the mouse.
She's trying.
Two countries negotiated a peace treaty.
Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
Answer me now.
They seemed to know what they were looking for.
You tried.
We'll just follow you.
I better get going with Tom.
Let's try it.
I wish I knew what was going on here.
Tom really knows a lot.
It's what it takes to sleep.
I have to tell Tom that.
I don't live in that town.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Tom's not a kid anymore.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm a vegetarian.
It's a habit of me doing it.
I have a sharp knife.
Tom asked me if he could use my computer.
That's very nice of you.
I've heard this joke before.
I think I missed something.
Send Tom in.
Tom asked me some questions about what just happened.
I'll keep you posted.
I acted instinctively.
The answer to this question is simple.
I'll make sure Tom has everything he needs.
He was naked chest and boss.
She's just out of my league.
What are we really looking for?
Why are you all in shock?
Schools and roads are tax-paid services.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Don't push.
Looks like it's just the two of us.
Things are very different today.
I couldn't stop crying.
Some religious people can be very condemning.
I'm really sick of this.
Tom did it the old way.
Where's Tehran?
Let's look at it again.
That sounds like treason to me.
That's what we need to practice.
Why are you all shocked?
It's part of my responsibility.
Underneath the drawing, he wrote, "Take the hot dogs!"
Drive slowly.
What a man you are!
Twice measure, cut once!
How long has Tom had it?
We can save up some time if we do what Tom suggests.
If you want to talk to a lot of people, you need to learn Esperanto. Why is this language nice and stimulating our learning at the same time. International language is very important because there are so many people from different countries around the world. Besides, Esperanto is not only useful but also easy to learn. If you learn Esperanto, you can travel many countries.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
Did you get some sleep?
I'll take you to Tom's.
Could that be Tom?
I have three beautiful grandchildren.
Don't argue.
She got her fingers on the table.
I'm learning a few languages.
I shouldn't have said that.
I wanted to write to you, but I forgot.
You're good to everyone.
Tom showed it to heaven.
I wasn't interested.
That's not true, is it?
Tom said he didn't see anything strange.
You never get in time.
That sounds like treason to me.
I'll try not to disturb you while you're studying.
Life is short.
They'll know.
All the participants gathered in the main hall.
Don't exaggerate.
Hey, relax.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Tom's going to prosper.
Tom was terrified.
Whose guitar is this?
This won't hurt at all.
We have to get away.
We can't stop Tom from doing this.
I'm not selective.
That's what I'm used to doing.
Tom's still at work.
You think better when you close your eyes.
Are we all here?
I'm dizzy.
Tom was groaning from pain.
Everything or nothing.
Do they love each other?
I contributed.
I'll sign it.
Shame him.
Exactly.
We hope you like it.
Will the future be like science fiction?
It just happened again.
How long have you been here?
Tom's rich and free.
My mother bought two bottles of orange juice.
That's not really my job.
I turned around.
To be honest, I don't know.
I hope he'll be all right.
The wind's calmed down.
I have a mirror from floor to ceiling in my bedroom.
I wish I'd remembered that.
Don't talk.
What can you do?
Get out of there.
The cheque festival was held in Latvia.
We are who we are.
Where did you get that idea?
She let me go.
You didn't answer the question.
We're in.
No one's coming to save you.
I have no desire to do that.
Tom always bothers me.
Are you ready?
She's proud of her talent.
You can start now.
You need one of these.
I'm impressed with you.
I can't decide where to park.
Cool!
How is this your fault?
Security has been increased in the city.
Cheers!
Tom's staying.
That boy talks like he's an adult.
The carrots cost three dollars.
My motorcycle is new.
Tom told me he loved me today.
I don't think Tom knows that.
Can I walk you home?
I've tried that before.
Go upstairs.

I'm running early.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's how he plays important.
How long have you stayed?
Tom's a passionate bikeman.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
We want to go to Boston and Chicago.
Let's take a look.
I'm too busy at work.

I'm interested.
What's the problem?
He's not a doctor.
Tom was accidentally made.
Is the handsome man Arab or Hindi?
Let's meet for a drink.
I forget where I leave my hat.
He's stuck again.
I want to see the ocean, too.
Don't even make a sound!
Who doesn't do that?
Tom does it sometimes.
God knows.
Tom loved Mary.
What do you say I do that?
Let's discuss your idea.
Tom said he was innocent.
All the girls love Tom.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Cover your mouth while coughing, sneezing or sniffing.
Tom's eating his nails.
He was a man who never hesitated to stand up.
Probably the periodic appearance of rabies comes because floating ice from Siberia can wear polar foxes on them.
I heard you didn't eat meat.

I'm Canadian.
I'll try.
Do I ever make a mistake?
What's the name of that restaurant?
It's official business.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.

Let's see what Tom says.
I'm starving.
Don't argue.
Come here.
Just tell me you're okay.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I'm not afraid of aging.
I don't agree with you completely.
There are many possible answers to that question.
Let's eat ice cream now, before it melts.
I'm just doing my duty.
I took the first step.
I love watching you play.
It's hard to apply what we said in practice.
How long has your head been hurting you?
Ole, the oldest eel in the world, just died, he was about 150 years old.
Come to the meeting.
I'm proud of this team.
I got some sleep.
Your mother put a collage on the top shelf.
Did you see anyone there?
My father's so old he can't work.
He got what he wanted.
What if I'm right?
I wish I could paint like that.
I'll try to find them.
I had problems resolving this problem.
I don't know what it wasn't, still or just before, was good, but several times when I tried to play the website today, I couldn't do it.
Do I usually look happy?
I went there on my own volition.
You think better when you close your eyes.
They really meant it.
Have you ever been here?
Do you really think I'm selfish?
They're all here.
We're almost done.
Maybe they need something to eat.
I thought you'd be busy.
I'm flexible.

I hope this never happens again.
Please be honest with me.
Tom stayed a few days.
Tom could be here.
I'll do anything for you.
I didn't understand the question.
It was only a matter of time.
Don't stare.
She should be able to change.

Are we safe now?
We are who we are.

Wonderful!
That's great!

You helped me so much.
Identify yourself.
I am truly happy about that.

Do you have a copy?
Come and help me.
I barely left the house when it started raining.
Tom likes to be busy.
First of all.

Does that mean you love me?
Check this out.
Is there any evidence?
You have to be strong!
Are you ready for more?
Tom turned on the blink.

Was I really that happy?
Tell me what this says.
I'm not upset anymore.
Did Tom change his mind?
Get lost.
Do you think what she said was a lie?
His younger brother is a famous footballer.
I was just too busy.
I already ordered it.
How does that work?
Are we going to see Tom again?
You're different.
Let's go somewhere, Tom.
It's my job, not Tom's.
Tell me what that is.
Tell him I'm innocent.
I'd like to help.
It would be difficult.
She's making him meals.
Where did you learn English?

What was the plan anyway?
You should be here the most late in half one.
Tom said no one was hurt.
Maybe Tom was involved.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
I saw a hip horse in the zoo.
I think about Tom sometimes.
Are you both drunk?
Please be honest with me.
Don't go out tonight.

I'll see if Tom can help us.
It broke into two parts.

Could you read it?
It's a glass window.
Are you done already?
Does Tom have a key?
Don't talk.
Don't stop.
Are you sure this is safe?
Better the devil you know than the devil you don't.
You'll be better off in a few days.
That's what Tom would want us to do.
Tom said to ask you.
Just tell me the truth.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not bitter at all.
Tom's a book moth.
I've changed my mind.
The problem is, it's too expensive.
Many would like to be motivated, creative, thoughtful creatures, only if they could get that chance.
You sound tired.
Tom was wrong about that.
Tom always makes a mess of things.
That's not the right thing.
Please write down everything I say.
I wish you could sleep.
Maybe you can't hear me.
We're grilling.
I thought you were married.
I'll find the money somehow.
I assumed you were busy.
I hear Tom's interested.
We should move forward.
What are your ambitions?
I don't like eating onions in the morning.
I think Tom's very smart.

Tell me what it says here.
I'm staying.
I know Tom let you down.
Tom was seriously hurt.
If you need help, tell me.
I took the first step.
I'm still a little tired.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
First leaves at 5:30 and arrives at 8:25.
That was a little weird.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put a ticket on the table.
It was just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom said he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hiding place?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
And now a word from our sponsor.
Do you have a copy?
We can't subpoena him.
That's not the main question.
We're glad to be here.
I'm armed.
Tom can't control it.
It's time for bed.
Tom wanted to have a better cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.

It's better for him now than before.
Tom and Mary are different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion about who's gonna win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not even want to meet and even it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be bitter disappointment for him. One such desire is the desire for everlasting life. If it were fulfilled, a man would become completely ill of eternal life, and would long for death.
Does Tom really speak French?
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car alone.
She's taking care of her old mother.
Tom had the same problem.
Don't laugh.
Tom and I just wrote a few books together.
The news's here.
No one really wants us.
Everyone paid.
Be careful.
I'm alone.
Don't drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
The price of gold changes every day.
Tom's married.
I could go with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
You have no permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is painting trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a simple guy.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll be in a hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
Do you like costumes?
I saw Marcus' house.
It really is pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
The house Ataturk was born in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
He's got two cars.
That was three months ago.
Let's hear your excuse.
They formed a swim team.
Tom took the package to the orphanage.
Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog is lying down.
Don't talk.
This information is classified.
Nope.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message, Mary?
I'll save you a seat in the first row.
Mary pushes her kids to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
The bathroom's upstairs.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom tricked you.
It's just a few minutes from here.
What do you know about me?
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals harassed animals with recklessness.
How angry are you going to be and yelling at us?
How important does that really matter?
Shall we have an appetite?
If you want, I'll teach you how to play ukulele.
I'm used to it already.
It's not that bad.
I like to play the music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
It's hard to work with you.
Tom's fattened.
It's my fault.
Don't answer.
Bring the wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the photos!
It takes a few old houses to crash.
What were you doing?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom snuck into the party.
Tom's very careful.
When are you leaving?
This report isn't very well written.
It stresses that this last move of the government has multiple meanings.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
It could be a trick.
Don't forget to wet your sunscreen.
Tom did not try to deny Mary's judgment.
Tell me what this is.
His hair covered almost his whole face.
How can I hate Tom?
India is the seventh country in the world in size.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow from the roof?
I'll make it up to you.
A student from Oslo who forged his degree into college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I had thought of that.
Tom made vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You've been really good to me.
Who are you, really?
We've all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not just an essay problem, it's all these terrible questions and explanations of words that drive me crazy!
The weekend's here.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
Clean it up.
Don't push.
Can we try this one?
Most people love chicken.
I didn't do that either.
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I was burnt badly.
Fall back.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Look out here, Tom.
We fixed some damage caused by splashing stones on your car.
His girlfriend didn't provide support.
Do you doubt me?
Fortunately, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
How could I resist?
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car alone.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't think so.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
We're not getting into that.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom definitely pulled the fatter ending out.
He's not even.
Everything's fine with me.
It's clear Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was 12; then I was interested in languages, but not in that extent; now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it's time for me to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the tune of that song.
I need an honest girl.
She's a rookie.
Are they still here?
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom so much.
Tom won't escape.
I'd leave.
Get down!
Tom couldn't handle it.
Anything you remember can help.
That's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a thorn in the eye like you, but this is just miserable.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
Please leave this place as clean as you wish to find it.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
That's all we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
It's your life.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
Learn as you do.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
They won't take it.
There's no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
I'm doing my job.
Everything's quiet again.
I didn't make it.
Tom's going to graphic design school.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always unhappy.
You should face up to that reality.
We managed to escape just in time.
I'm sick of it.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
I want to talk to Tom about it.
It's supposed to work.
She hated him.
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens.
Take some.
He's talking about how he'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused he didn't even know what question to ask.
Find Tom.
I think it's okay.
What do you think?
You changed my life.
The reaction is not always the best way to act.
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
The committee recommends that those who complained should be compensated for the proportional part of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of superreal.
In theory, it's possible, but in practice, it's very difficult.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the name of the file before you try to retrieve the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
I didn't get nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting.
Tom had no idea I'd be there.
We won't let you die.
A lot of things work out for me.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of his work.
Tom was always a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Tom's one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much will I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It happens.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for his exam?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to shoot stones in a glass house.
I'm gonna scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd like to get involved.
Don't squirt.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do it.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
I probably won't watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the fatter end?
Give me all the money.
Mer was very supportive.
The girl sees the boy.
It's very difficult, almost impossible, to find an apartment in Oslo.
My French is still not very good.
It happened right here.
I don't know Latin.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I'm waiting for my turn.
I've been so upset by the news.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have some tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
Tom asked for help.
They know you.
I've passed every test.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right now.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
I can't believe all this.
I could have left, but I didn't want to.
It was snowing yesterday.
We were walking through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I went out at the wrong bus station.
I wrote this song only for you.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him any money.
Are we safe now?
Are you going to send this as a mailbox?
What are you suggesting?
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Have you talked about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
Come on, give me that.
Do you blame me?
I wish I was pretty.
For some strange people, the knowledge of some language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They were moving forward slowly.
I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
Don't look.
Blue suits you.
Come visit us soon.
Have you been in an accident?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My father doesn't like football.
We're all out of alcohol.
Card, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
Something was lying on the ground.
My friend lives behind his feet.
Do you think Tom would want to go fishing with us next weekend?
What are you doing today?
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary's a very shy little girl.
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a long day ahead of you.
It's good.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I'm not going to participate.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always act rational.
I didn't do that either.
Did you pass your exams?
I strongly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Do we agree?
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Tom went that way.
Am I safe now?
Give me a number.
Neither can I.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do it.
Tom was afraid of me earlier.
Tom whispered something Mary and she smiled.
May I take a look at your ticket?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
It's clear.
Today is your daughter's birthday.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a knocking error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a nice garden.
The cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom's got a haircut.
I've seen enough for now.
I hate that.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Here's what I think.
I could come with you.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you deactivate the bomb?
I need five more minutes.
I bet you know who told me that.
Mary used the apples Tom gave her to make apple butter.
How many songs did you write?
We're glad to have you here.

How do we manage others when we can't manage ourselves?
Don't rush it.
You can learn, regardless of age.
He dedicated his life to a vision of what he wanted to create for himself and others.
Did you give it to Tom?
Who have you recently helped?
Just close your eyes.
Tom's a little worried.
How is this your fault?
How did I miss this?
What should I write here?
My father bought me a book.
I'm flexible.
Citizenship's a prerequisite to vote.
How many times have you been here?
He's fixing electronic devices.
Lose.
I'm ready, bro.
Please kick out as hard as you can.
This fish is big.
Pass me sugar, please.
It's nice to be needed.
I hope we understand this.
We all have to stand up to this.
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
I thought it was shocking.
Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired I can barely keep my eyes open.
Give me some sugar, please.
Come quickly!
Where did you get the keys?
You ever hang a video on YouTube?
I was very interested in building a more intense academic programming plan.
Just give me the money.
She's pregnant.
Don't let Tom know.
I can't wait for Monday.
Have you been here before?
Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
I could kill you now.
Mary used the sticks to walk that helped her rises and falls on her journey.
The compass shows north.
Don't talk.
Some religious people can be very condemning.
Whose initiative was this done?
Finish this.
Which one should I take?
I love cable meals.
Where's your friend?
When do we start eating?
The Queen and the King have reunited their powers.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I assume you already know the answer to that.
The flowers introduced it completely.
"How old are you?" " Sixteen."
I like this book the least.
Blue looks good on you.
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he was going to be.
Give me that other box.
Tom has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He took off his clothes.
It was fun celebrating together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
You really should take a shower.
What's the purpose of life?
He's driving the lights.
My right hand's jammed.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You should probably talk a little slower.
I need a beer.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Please, have a seat.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
I need you to talk to me.
It just wasn't our day.
Take it all.
I reigned.
It's all wrong.
Everything's ruined.
Marriage between persons of the same half is now legal in 20 countries, including Ireland since yesterday.
Take this home with you.
She bought bread.
We'll try it your way.
Help yourself.
You deserve to be congratulated.
Since the message was in French, I read it easily.
Finish this.
Tom tried to answer Mary from that.
Could you hand me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where were you in Japan?
Everyone's gone.
I'll learn more diligently.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
None of us have seen Tom do it.
And you're wondering why we can't handle your company?
You miswritten my name.
You're different.
Shame her.
I have two cats.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
His girlfriend wasn't supporting.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were and are still in constant danger due to political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I still don't think the Internet is a place for children.
That was hard on me.
What did you conclude?
You're made for me.
He needs her.
It's obviously about a tipfeler.
Are we done here?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom got into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a minor.
Control yourself.
Tell her.
I'd take it.
You're my luck.
I'm waiting for the bus.
Bad things are going to happen.
A few trees fell during the storm in our surroundings.
I'm sure I've seen her before.
Everyone smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
He refused to comment.
We're trying.
I'm giving up.
Tom seemed angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sure they need you.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think I'm doing very well.
Tom's no longer a member of this club.
That helps us so much.
I'm filling up a glass.
I'm not selective.
How many aunts do you have and uncles?
That morning, Mary visited the whole village.
The rumor spread quickly.
Am I that different?
Tom took out the keys and opened the door.
I just got here.
What Tom did was a big help.
I've never noticed that before.
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Mr. Jackson is our teacher.
I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Smoke slept with 25 men during one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I thought you couldn't do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This is making me very uncomfortable.
The cost will grow soon.
Was I really that happy?
Tom could be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.
Tom's going to call.
I had dinner with her.
You see everything in black.
My car wasn't good enough.
Do they suspect me?
What do you need to do?
Tom likes to drive.
They couldn't travel because there was a problem.
Winter's gone, spring's come.
It really is so simple.
Since those newspapers were written that no farmer wants to work as a buyer in Westfold, interest has grown rapidly.
I'm punished.

We're a little busy here.
Get on board.
It's really surprising.
Have you ever seen a UFO?
You're standing in my passage.
It's gotten dark.
What's a big secret?
The police are after me.
I took the first step.
I hope Tom remembers this.
We ask teachers questions every day.
What kind of food do you usually cook?
If the world wasn't the way it is now, I could trust everyone.

I prayed for you.
Etherium and bitcoin are encrypted.
Hello, can you hear me?
We live on the sixth floor.
I'm not afraid of you at all.
Whenever I see you, my heart tells me I'm in love.
Are you all right, folks?
Will you help me?
It hasn't gotten that much worse.
Tom took the chairs to the next room.
I'm ruined.
I respect people like that.
Did you see her work?
Is that a yes or no?
Don't laugh.
I'm not a bad student.
We're done for today.
He's a complete monarch.
Since the consequences are potentially serious, there is a general precaution to avoid infections in this type of patient.
I'm a free man.
I don't like people being distracted.
The room was dark.
He's going home.
That b could be a weapon.
I can't fix the car myself.
I better get going with Tom.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
Shouldn't you be getting ready for school?
I want to feel important.
One second later, his lips cured into a vicious smile.
My mother was an alcoholic.
Mary's enthusiasm for the course fell when her favorite lecturer moved out.

The United States has launched an atomic bomb on Hiroshim in 1945.
You reading anything interesting?
There's no smoking allowed in here.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom's always very nice.
I barely closed my eye.
Was Tom here when we got here?
Was I truly so happy?
I took off my wig.
Tom won't be happy to hear it.
Tom was named after his father.
Did he really commit suicide with that?
I'm gonna go take a nap.
What was I supposed to do?
Stay away from my wife.
They'll know what to do.
Do you have a copy?
I wasn't really a friend.
Did I drop that?
I just want to get out of here.
What makes you think that?
Little kids like to touch everything.
She wrapped her hair with papilots.
He was released from the military service.
My right is bleeding.
I'm motivated.
Knowledge frees us and makes us better men.
I didn't mean to drag you in.
Are we safe now?
Which of your friends will come?
Can you explain them to me?
I've seen Tom play a lot of times.
You tried.
I'm taking you to the dance.
Tom might try to convince Mary to do it.
She makes a mosquito elephant.
You told me not to lie.
He was once a member of the social elite, rather than a representative of the wide mass.
I'm terrified.
Help us achieve our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't rush.
Give me a pen.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what's best, because it's always individual and depends on the situation.
Tom thought Mary was sweet.
Be careful.
You look like a very smart person.
I have the same desire to go abroad for a year to perfect.
The house burned to the ground before the firefighters arrived.
Months of the highest rain are May, June, July and August.

I was ready for that.
Show me the papers.
It's about...
It can be hard about passion, maybe it's just sex.
Are you done washing the dishes?
I'm the only one who can do it here.
Tom's going to pay.
Hunting season's over.
I love cable kitchen.
I'll start with a beer.
Thank God.
That gives me an idea.
Is Tom around?
I'm motivated.
What a tragedy!
We're here.
Knowledge makes us free and better men.
Don't talk.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
I'm almost never home during the day.
The best parents of all are those who allow their children to follow their innate talents.
I'd go.
You're very sloppy.
You let me down.
There's been snow all year on this mountain.
I don't think you should rush with anything these days.
What in nature is forever, when everything is so passing?
The engine's overheating.
See you later!
Without you, I feel lost.
I have to plan everything.
This may not be enough.
You got that pretty good.
Everything you have one day will have you.
No matter how busy Tom is, he never forgets that our email to his shirt at least once a week.
The dog is dead.
This is life.
Do we have any of those?
Is this your suitcase?
Tom stopped for a second.
Because of the bad weather, the plane was late.
Explore them.
I'm in better shape than you.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
I think it's possible to do that.
I'll go to sleep in about an hour.
I'm pretty happy now.
He first made a preliminary test with a new electronic alcohol test, before he was sent to a laboratory test.
We were walking around the park.
I'm sure you're very busy.
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Look around.
It was a stressful day.
Is it clear?
Are these your bags?
I don't know who they are.
Tom was looking from close.
Let us help you.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
What's your job?
Let's continue the discussion.
How much will I get?
I want to be with you.
This was sophisticated and painted in a person so strange, cruel and stubborn that a little man dared to work closely with him.

Tom used to come here as a student a lot.
We'll take the next one.
Did you do your homework?
Check everyone.
Tell us a story about ghosts.
Check everyone.
The session's over.
I have a lot planned for tomorrow.
We need to follow Tom.
Tom saved $300.
What does she look like?
I'm pathetic.
I can't wait till Monday.
Come with us.
Tom's on his way here.
Tom wasn't fat.
That's crystal clear.
I'm trapped.
Cut cheese on thin pieces or on small cubes.
Have you ever had a car accident?
I'd like to start.
I wasn't wearing an intruding clothes.
I'm fascinated.
Just serious questions, please.
Man, that sentence has caused a real distraction.
Give food to the homeless.
I translated the song as best I could.
He left a few minutes ago.
I believe you're being honest with me.
Tom wanted a bigger house than his neighbor.
Tom's got an eye infection.
I'm glad we were there.
Although I was sick, I did my best.
Big boys don't cry.
I could go there now.
I need to write ten pages for next Monday.
The situation was extremely dangerous; it was a matter of life and death.
I've never noticed that before.
I have to sleep.
Tom usually comes to school before any other class student.
I'm touched.
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him money.
Why?
"Where do I sit?" "Whereever."
Wisdom is needed to understand wisdom: music does not exist for the deaf audience.
I don't want to play this game.
I knew you couldn't do that.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis match.
The troubled children are often without any sense of guilt.
I feel bad for lying.
I called him.
Maybe they gave up.
That's why I liked Tom.
Tom's red.
Tell him.
How do you get rid of the mole in the garden?
It's Saturn.
My aunt gave me flowers.
I hope that's not true.
Don't stop.
I don't like it when you work at home.
Of course, Tom loves his kids.
Where are you now?
It's very likely that the FIFA is rotten to the core.
She gave me a contradictional answer.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
He's wearing a gold chain around his neck.
I'm very proud of it.
Attaturk was born in 1881 in Thessaloniki.

I want to answer the last question first.
Did you tell Tom this?
We don't know our neighbors.
It's only five in the morning, and it's already light outside.
I hate math.
What's your aunt doing?
If there is, a crosover with it will happen eventually.
Tom's a good Frenchman.
I couldn't help Tom do it.
I know this is weird.

It's going to take forever.

Tom would like to know if you'd like to come to this party.
You've grown up.

I never regretted what I did.
I'm convinced.
Do you speak Roma?
Tom came to see me yesterday afternoon.
Hello, my friend!
Tom's still at work.
Did you sleep enough last night?
This must be the place.
If you're not a good girl, you're not getting a birthday present.
They must have known all the time.
"I think ending is ugly," he said. "Somewhere in the things people make I want to see scars, failure, mess, distortion."
Get it all.
Are these your bags?
I turned Tom down.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
I'd buy that one.
This is beyond all boundaries.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
It wasn't too hot.
I almost forgot my passport.
Tom's reading a lot.
I hope you're not talking about me.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not this busy on Monday.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, to live.
Tom seemed very confused.
I thought you couldn't do that.
Just tell Tom I called.

Tom, I need your help.

I called him.
How many calories does that sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
I like to watch you work.
I hope we visit Beijing too.
You're my inspiration.
This time I refrained from commenting on my beloved friend.
I agree.
Be careful.
Has anyone called me?
We'll have lunch together at 30:30.
I'm still a little tired.
That he seeks to maximize his own interest, happiness or security looks very natural for one human being.
I can do it as a joke.
I'm not singing.
It's strange nobody knows the victim.
We're five minutes away.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not as close as many people think.
Tom would never admit that.
It was just a start.
Did you finish your homework?
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the gods on the tree we knocked down and discovered it was 30 years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you have it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems upset.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.

No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you lived here?
Get help.

I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom's lost his sense.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
Tom's going to look into it.
I have a cell phone that just shows a message about the mistake.
I'm amazed.
Everyone smiled.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
I don't have a guitar.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
My friend can speak Hindi liquidly.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Where can I find the tourist office?
I'm comfortable.

Tom wrote the country with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
cheer yourself up!
The odds are against me.

Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I'm not getting you drunk.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen a lot.
Are we leaving soon?
They sell sugar in the store.

The white family will come to Tokyo in half an eleven.
What have you done to me?
Enjoy.
Let me write you footsteps.
Tom's probably still hiding.
Whatever Mary is wearing, she looks sweet.
Watch out!
Tom failed to expose any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You have a bad temper.
I was just on my way.
I bought this yesterday.
I've had a very bad day.
The whole state is on it!
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does she love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm rude.
I was happy yesterday.
By the way Mary slammed the door, Tom realized she was sad.
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to run a futon at least twice a week.

Leave the book on the top shelf.
We could be happy here.

Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Could you do that?
I just saw that the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia resigned.
Be careful.
Maybe something's wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had problems resolving this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
You're the most boring person I've ever known.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do it.
I'll check it out.
Tom was shocked.
One moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom still seems upset.
That's what the doctor ordered.
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.

That's an exception.
Tom came in a little early today than usual.
I could eat a horse.
I never really met Tom.
Which one's easier?

I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
I always liked Tom more.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the papers and read them on the train on his way to work.
I've got ghosts.
Look at that.

I'm doing great.
Did you expect anything else to happen?

It's been a big help.
Give me another case.
Tom still has a little time.
The baseball is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
I was just pushing it off.
I'm sure it wasn't on purpose.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
We're lost, aren't we?
We won't let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
This is the beginning of a new era.
I don't have a ticket.
Nothing happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Everything is different.
The truth has to be said.
Look at how much it is!
We have to go shopping.

"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.

Students didn't know how to answer.
It's a good intent.
I've already thought about it.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
I'll live.

That's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?

That's perfectly normal.
It's said it's a new restaurant.
The price of this book is five dollars.
Can you keep secrets?

How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't agree with you entirely.
Do you keep this place for someone?
How are you these days?

Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have a Facebook?
Tom's been working around nine hours continuously.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Everyone couldn't hear what Tom said.
I'll take a shower.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It was a presentation to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do this.
Tom didn't practice.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should re-test.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans gained leverage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
I'll pray for your family.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.

That makes me so angry.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.

That's very nice of you.
I wish I had thought of that.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw the cat.
I saw the cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom's back safe.
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You've tried.
Don't leave me alone.
Wow!
I'm sure Tom won't want to go through with it.
Tom is strict but fair.

You need one of these.
Can you cook?

I learned the French myself.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak spot.
You're one of us.
One foot is in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
I'm sympathetic.
Tom's unhappy.
That would be a pleasure.
He's crazy like electricity.
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
How old are you really?
Tom asked me if I slept last night.

What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.

That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to deal with things in a walk.
This one's so cool.
I enjoyed it.
I bought a lot of stuff.

Please wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do it!
I'm tired of arguing.
How was your day?
What am I doing here?
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
I was definitely lucky.
What first song have you ever written?
Tom might be up to it.
I just want to get away.
Don't let your chance get out of this good.
Be careful.
He's in first year of law school.
I was looking for grape juice.
I've been thinking about my family.

I nodd once.
I'm sorry to bother you all the time.
He's a man of power.
Wonderful!
I'm tickled.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it on time?
It's strange the postman hasn't arrived yet.
How do we prevent that from happening?
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll buy a boat soon.
Tom said he wouldn't be waiting.
Close your eyes, Tom.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be right up.
We have to go.

The brakes are squeezed.
Have you fully recovered?
I'll listen.
Tom spoke very loudly.
Don't move!

He knows all his customers' names.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved in people he should never have mixed up with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write, and I'll write it.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's the problem you have to solve for yourself.
I exaggerated.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom put the book down.
This should work.
There's no need to judge a man in his appearance.
That's unconnected.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the e-mail!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wasn't going to tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've been there before.
That's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
So what are your plans?

Tom shut the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.

Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not being liked by anyone.
The brakes squeezed.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to express the song he wrote when he was 13 years old.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
That was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.

A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow's gonna be a good time.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.

I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working his whole life.
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
Tom will live.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I truly so happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'm gonna be late.

There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave Tom a message.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
Tom has a family now.
That doesn't surprise me.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
Can I call you in 20 minutes?
As little as we know about her origin, at least we can be sure it's the pilot of Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
The deer's faster than the stronger.
People used to write books to knock machines.

Are you coming back now?
I hope not.
How could I hate Tom?
You're wearing this.
How barbaric!
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I look forward to your letter.

I've made my decision.
Do you have a copy?
We're going to the movies.
I wouldn't hurt her.
In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he wrote it, he would already know that it would never appear in the press. I get my regular salary to keep my sincere opinion outside the newspapers that I do. Many of you are also paid similarly for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he thinks, he would be out on the street, looking for another job. If I let my right opinion appear only in one newspaper I work for, I would get fired from work in less than 24 hours.

Thank you so much for this information!

There were so many people on the train that I had to stand.
I don't have any homework today.
Tom and Mary are getting along nicely.
When can Tom get home?
In the window glass, I see a reflection of my face.
Go talk to Tom.
I've been thinking about my family.
You could've spared me the arrivals only if you had told me I shouldn't even be here today.

I'd agree.

Come in.
Did I call you?

The rainy season begins in June.
Who knows what's going to happen tomorrow?

My parents don't like my girlfriend, they think she's not good enough for me.
Tell me what you wrote.
Tom left this morning not finishing his breakfast.
You don't even know his name, do you?
I'm so sorry, Tom.
This kind of state of things can't be tolerated.
We've never played football before.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
It's so light.
When is the meeting?
I could go there now.
I'm stubborn.
The lie made him in trouble when his boss found out the truth.
He looks good for his age.
I really love my team members.
What did you both do?
We're in trouble now.
It looked so delicious.
I have a rock in my shoe.
Can you give me a sign?
Tell me what I missed.
He asked me to help him.
Tom has a younger sister Mary.
I could've used that.
I was very excited.

You're in better shape than I am.
How's that?
I'll do my best to find them.

Before this decision goes into effect, no one will move with a finger to solve this.
Do you have anything to report?
I've always hated doing that.
Tom's not a baby anymore.
Welcome to your new home.
Tom must have known that Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom's going to be able to talk.
It wasn't easy for me.
He's accelerated.
Tom tried to help us.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
I'm in a habit of doing that.
It's not the right choice.
It's all in the report.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
I met some wonderful people.
I had lunch with him.
Are you coming, Tom?
Try it.
Think again.
How's Tom at work?
That's what a doctor needs.
I want to be human again one day.
Why is that so complicated?
What am I doing here?
Tom wears black a lot.
You want to come in?
Maybe I'm missing something here.
Check around.
Our school was founded in 1990.
You can sit next to me.
The danger is lurking around every corner.

Since she won the lottery, she went out to the shopping party.
It's getting harder to concentrate.
Show me the pictures!
I think she's from Austria.
Please wait until I'm ready.
It always is.
I'm interested.
Louder, please.
Could you talk to Tom for me?
Get Tom out of here.
Sleep for a few hours.
What happened?
The intelligence satellite is a military satellite capable of overseeing many activities on earth, listening to communication lines, registering the working frequency of radar systems...
I asked you last night.
You're very pretty.
I doubt it will be difficult for you to receive a license.
It's a depressing story.
You don't look so good.
I'm glad you're back.
I'm not talking to Tom.
Tom and Mary are playing chess with a bunch of handmade chess figures allegedly from an elephant.
If the warrant already exists, it'll function on a system you can receive and e-mail.
Go talk to Tom.
I'm confident.

I'm homeless.
I thought I was stabbed.
I'm just thinking out loud.
I thought you were going to the Boston bus.
Why tell Tom anything?
I could've used that.
I hope I can write two or three songs this weekend.
You don't know me.
How are Tom and Mary?
Doesn't mean something's a good idea just because it's possible.
He opened the door.
I hope Tom's coming back safely.
I like what you wrote.
Don't blink.
Where did you find this knife?
They need you to help them.
Do you have anything to report?
We want complete sentences.
Get your ass over here!
I'm not the owner.
I sincerely hope Tom's predictions come true.
If we got here earlier, maybe we could save Tom.
Why are you leaving?
The gold is in the green forests.
I'm scared.
You met my sister, didn't you?
How many years has it been since I last saw you?
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
Who left the door open?
I can't live without a TV.
Tom was sitting very quiet.
Norway has a lot of old empty stables.

So you want to learn another language.
What day is tomorrow?
Tom postponeed his drink.
Maybe he'll come see us tonight.
Air conditioning's broken.
I'm not like anyone else.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
Get out.
I thought you wouldn't want that.
Would you like some more potato pire?
And then something amazing happened.
Such a project, of course, required budget rebalance.
I'm not sure where Tom is.
I had no idea what to write.
I can write very quickly.
Don't worry, I can do it.
Swimming makes your legs stronger.
I forgot to pay my rent.
I didn't do it either.
The guard's outside.
I'll be in my neighborhood.
We'll get over this again.
I didn't get nervous about it.
It's fun.
Girls like to play houses.
I wish I hadn't done it.
The train arrived on time today, as always.
Will you talk to Tom instead of me?
Norway is my new country.
It's stuck.
You'll never catch me alive!
Tom's the youngest.
Has anyone told Tom about this before?
Did you wash the dishes?
Come closer.
Tom's not the right guy for that job.
Tom took the kids to the park.
Please stop here.
Tom really looks familiar.
I'm just messing with you.
I'm not ready to go.
How can anyone sleep with all this distraction?
Tom could convince Mary to do that.
Was I truly so happy?
Are we safe now?
He made her happy.
What did you do today?
How much will I take?
She was the only one who understood me.
You can't just eat one.
Be careful.
The dogs are smart.
I give you what you want.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'll leave early today.
How avanturistic!
Tell me what that is.
Did you do your homework?
Get lost!
Who's knocking?
I'm really happy to be here.
Please don't yell.
Why are you acting childish?
We could only save Tom if we could have arrived a few minutes early.
I know this is weird.
I'm glad we were there.
Do you have anything to say?
Why did you do that?
Tom was very nice.
I should buy a new coat because my old man slipped.

Who has time for this?
I'm still sleepy.
Tom's a Dai-Traider.
My stomach hurts.

Have a nice week!
Doping is not compatible with my ideological views of sport.

That was terrible.
I wasn't confident at all.
Never say never.
I took part in the competition.
Did you eat anything?
France is in west Europe.
I hope Tom stays here.
The planes are landing at the airports.
That's your whole wisdom!
Tom was wearing a black hat.
You did what you had to do.
Tom always seems unhappy.
We're out of money.
I think everyone's exaggerating.
I'm very happy about that.
Tom turned himself to leave.
I'll never mention this again.
Let me show you where to put it.
Why didn't you let Tommy talk to Maria?
Wake up at seven in the morning.
What would I do without you?
I think Tom will be able to help us overcome this.
I've already been paid.
They're all stuck.
Did I call you?
Come on Tuesday, if possible.
We have to be realistic.
Don't look.
They accidentally heard some kind of suspicious activity in the bar that suggests that the bear smelled their food.
I've been everywhere in europe.
Can I help you, sir?
Don't stare.
You asked for it yourself.
How is this your fault?
You can't blame Tom for everything.
Come to my neighborhood.
I don't want to live with you.
I'm devastated.
Tom's in pain all the time.
The other girls from Mary's department laughed at her because of her clothes.
Everyone's either going through it or going through it.
I'll get on it right away.
I'm broke.
Tom and Mary enjoy walking along the way of pilgrimage to France.
Tell Tom I'm innocent.
Can you help me translate these sentences to Chinese?
Did you watch it?
Are you busy here?
I chose between two options.
We have what we need.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Did you take a good look?
Tom asked me to wake him up at 7:30.
We didn't do it.
Did you wash the dishes?
Please, give them to me.
How does Tom do it?
Be careful.
Do you have a paper I can write by?
He was walking down the street.
Do you agree with that?
We just had dinner.
I'm sure they need you.
That's good.
You're one of us.
Do you have a dog?
I saw the cat.
I've been there before.
Tom's book is at the top of the Christmas book sale, and it's hardly gonna get rid of it.
Tom's working for Mary now.
I'm armed.
Is it necessary to make such a noise?
Did you wash the dishes?
Give me another reason.
Let's have a drink!
I assumed you were busy.
Are you dyslexic?
If only I'd known.
Change your clothes.
That's all I could find.
A large group of people gathered.
I'm working on my project.
Everything's well prepared in advance.
That's not what I'm counting on.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
They gave water to their horses.
I'll give you anything you want.
The girls were wearing grass skirts and they had flowers around their necks.
Can you call a doctor?
Tom's the only feeder in the family.
He might already have gone.
You're wrong.
This could take weeks.
You can format and configure the table for cross budgets, insert and use plain tables, diagrams, formulas and functions.
I'll be staying at the Hilton Hotel.
Which one of you will come with me?
Call me anytime, on my shoulder, you can always cry.
I'm reformed.
What happens next time?
The doctors are still trying to save Tom.
No one believed her.
The detectives are still investigating.
Tom was sophisticated.
This sad story was written at the time Tom was in exile.
Tom's not like the other boys.
We'll take the stairs.
I'm sure I'm gonna win that tennis game.
Do you have anything to say?
Change your clothes.
We should have brought another bottle of wine.
Men want to feel desirable.
She tried.
You don't mind, do you?
How would you feel if you were abandoned by your husband?
Can you prove that?
It's a dead end.
It's easy to write this pen.
Are you ready for more?
This pen doesn't work.
Did you see me dance?
I'd rather not be involved in this at this point.
Tom closed the fence.
I had dinner with him.
I really hope I'm wrong.
Are you busy here?
Tom used to play the guitar before.
I'm actually a nice guy.
That's what both of them like.
Must have been terrible.
I'll lend you a paperwork if you promise me you won't write anything on it.
My friends live in the same house as I do.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
Did Tom find him?
Are they in love?
Where can we meet tomorrow?
Tom saved Mary.
Latin is the language of the future!
I think everyone's ready.
You'll see her.
Tom has a dark secret.
Did you eat anything?
Let's get this straight.
Stiglitch is a very interesting bird.
The connection between a person and a blood group has not been scientifically confirmed.
I thought you were married.
I'm singing.
It's Tom.
I've checked some things.
I don't sing.
I'd love to kiss you.
The kids are playing outside.
Will you be here soon?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
A working group dealing with data transfer led by Ben Manni will hold a meeting on January 14, 1999.
Some say if you step on a rainbow, it'll start to rain.
In my beginning, it's my end.
I just got here.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
What am I supposed to see?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Tom can knock very quickly.
Are we all here?
I'll be right back with your order.
My sister's playing with dolls.
Identify yourself.
Take the money.
I'm saving up to buy a new saxophone.
Don't just give up.
I'll give you what you want.
Who did you write the letter to?
Maybe I'll need some help.
Does this mean you don't love me anymore?
I'm not a specialist.
I'm tougher than I look.
No one's here.
Tom's youngest daughter is his favorite.
Tom bought some newspapers and read them on the train.
I won't be home next week.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
That would be okay.
What do you call it?
How does Tom know the French?
I like to watch you work.
Answer me now.
There's no policy established.
Write down what I say.
The rain finally stops.
I live in an old house.
Do you love your mother?
It was a big explosion.
Tom winked.
I didn't step outside today.
Did they give you a reason?
Can you spell me your name?
Look at this.
She was saving a living head.
I think we should call a doctor.
You're so early today.
We got Tom in action.
We should be realistic.
She took off her clothes.
Tom's house is for sale.
Tom wasn't happy with the results.
I hid under the table.
They're holding me hostage.
Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
I've been there before.
Tom asked Mary how she liked the new job.
I'm a big football fan.
What are you going to do with all this?
Mary makes a living sewing.
Could you hand me some water, please?
Where's your friend?
I don't know what to think about this.
I don't like her at all.
Tom's used to winning.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Tom's not sure what he wants to do with his life.
We're here for you.
I'm intrigued.
What do you want?
The drugs mostly don't have to be mixed with alcohol.
Did you see who that was?
When I woke up, it was snowing.
Some people no matter what age they are, don't lose their beauty.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
Don't talk.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's quite extraordinary.
Bad things are going to happen.
Why would Tom come now?
I panicked.
Come on, try it now.
We'd better get inside.
Actually, I'm not sure.
Explore her.
She was dressed in red.
What does a Sovietologist study?
It's all a big joke.
Tom was talking about music.
Have you fully recovered?
We had a big fight.
Tom's still hiding.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't speak French.
Keep working.
Hope loses when you experience a difficult situation and a pointless brake.
I laughed.
The new constitution will not solve Egypt's problems.
Solar energy is a clean source of energy.
It felt like Tom wasn't doing what he was supposed to do.
I'm not lying to you.
Did you see me dance?
Did you eat anything?
Tom is in no danger.
It's too easy.
All men are the same.
Is it clear?
They haven't woken up yet.
Everything's free.
Welcome.
We don't have a choice.
I've never really been anywhere.
He keeps losing his cell phone.
I'm angry.
I'm thinking about going to Australia, too.
I'm sure Tom will win.
Are the Americans really that individual?
You can go play with your friends when you're done cleaning up the house.
That's my problem, not yours.
What's your specialization?
I'm twice as old as Tom.
You are the love of my life.
Tom couldn't talk to Mary and he couldn't influence it.
And now that I remember everything I've experienced, I've really learned a lot.
I wasn't too surprised.
The team is as strong as his weakest member.
I've never camped.
There are many unhonest people in the world.
Don't yell.
When was the last time you heard from Tom?
Hungarian language isn't easy, but it's beautiful.
I think so, too.
I prefer a tent with a storm blanket, along with crossed rods because of wind stability and snowy nanosis, and this has to be a double layer tent.
Tell Tom I'm saying hello.
I can't be something I'm not.
Where do we meet?
Do you think what she said was a lie?
Tom didn't do it.
I'm touched.
Tom's been fired.
Do you plan on going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
This candidate is considerably better compared to his predecessor.
Don't call me while I'm in the office.
Thank you for loving me.
The doctor is interrogating a patient.
Tom passed his drink.
This is a lot more than justice.
I could lose pension.
She's in a bad mood.
I've always known that.
Don't look.
Every communication is a translation.
I'm trying to be careful.
I'm really happy about that.
I've never been camping.
They believe in God.
Everyone's the boss in their own house.
Let's hope you're right.
We split up on a corner.
Are you angry about that?
I baked my tongue.
You've tried.
I thought I could rely on Tom.
When there's no news, that's good news.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
Did that fall out to me?
Have you been sleeping?
They tried hard in court.
Is there a reason why you keep these old bottles?
We talked for a while.
I have to go now.
Can I take your dictionary?
No one else was hurt.
We have to try.
That fabric's not from India, is it?
I'll buy what I need tomorrow.
Maybe I'm antisocial, but that doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
I believe you're being honest.
I didn't choose anything.
Let's try something.
Are you in Paris?
Don't leave me alone.
Tom started studying French last year.
Tom sat on the bench all day, writing postcards.
Aren't you going to eat anything?
It's abandoned.
Don't move!
I've already thought about it.
The money's talking.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Tom told me his father died.
We have to spend less!
I parked twice.
I've never noticed that before.
Do you want to live in Mumbai?
Tom broke something again.
Tell me where you live.
You have to teach me these days.
I love this store.
I'm about to start looking for you.
He leads a turbulent life.
I'm not a rich man.
I really like your music.
That's what I'm used to.
Tom has the right attitude.
Anatomic breast implants, however, can also lead to deformation of breast form if rotating on the side.
Where did you get the keys?
I'm not going to tell anyone you did it.
She tried.
Tom was a little blurred.
I saw the bus.
Tom's wise enough not to do something like that.
I brought these reports to give you a closer look at them.
I'm not both as rich as we'd like.
Get on board.
Tom's still mad.
Why are you still awake?
Please don't make me eat that.
I think your work is very good.
Tom helped Mary put on his coat.
Have fun while you can.
The Internet isn't your personal army.
I could come with you.
Unfortunately, he went from Almighty God to become powerless, filthy, small and irrelevant man in the corner of a small province in the vast empire.
We should do better.
The weather forecast says tomorrow afternoon will rain.
Tom's a real gentleman.
I saw the snake.
It's useless.
What planet are you from?
Are you listening?
Am I in love?
Wait, wait, don't go yet.
Did you eat anything?
Give me another reason.
What did you two do?
Is this your first exam?
Life goes on!
Tom's already here, but Mary's not here yet.
I'm sure Tom's coming to the party.
Okay, we have a deal.
Let's not be emotional.
Tom's very patient.
Everything changes.
Tom knows where the wind blows.
Women are the most beautiful ones in a man's life.
When you get your phone, the battery is in advance loaded.
Tom knows that now.
I volunteered.
Shut up!
Tom likes it most.
Tom's driving me crazy.
This famous actress was also a fashion icon.
I'm not moving to Boston.
I'm impatient.
I finished studying the esperant at Duoling yesterday.
Tom attacked Mary's sister.
Am I safe now?
We'll get to work right away.
I did what I could for him.
All I'm gonna say is, you're beautiful.
Are you allergic to any food?
Tom's listening because he's convincing.
My suitcase hasn't been packed yet.
Did you sleep?
The readers were in pain, waiting at least three months before they got an answer.
Do you know anyone who passed the exam last year?
Mary took her time off for the trip.
They live on a high leg.
Tom got out of the limo.
I'm sure I've seen this guy before.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
You don't support me much.
What's he drinking?
You'll see her.
He's everything, he's just not fair.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
The police asked the criminal to hand over his gun.
It's human to sin, to forgive it is divine.
I've passed all the tests.
I just needed some time.
I have to go.
Please be honest with me.
Tom knows it's hopeless.
What's that?
A man dreams, God determines.
Tom was wearing black jeans.
Must have been fun.
What do you have to say?
That gives me an idea.
Did you just meet them?
It's more art, not science.
Is this place taken?
It was just like that.
Add more water.
Tom counts the change.
All parking spaces are full.
This is my brother, Tom.
Use the device until you are warned to fill the battery and then fill it for 5 hours to achieve maximum capacity.
Tom's still a bachelor.
You're becoming reckless.
No, don't do that.
I had a dog when I was little.
Tom was with a girl, but he couldn't see who he was.
I'm not going to ask Tom to do it.
They all stood.
I pretended I don't understand.
Would you like to talk to Tom?
Can you hand me the remote?
Why are you leaving?
Now it's time to enjoy it.
Did he fulfill his goals?
I just want to go home.
Tom's upset about this.
Have you seen my dog?
I have a book.
What do your kids usually eat?
Am I so different?
We had a terrible fight.
And Tom's a salesman.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Testing the new engine will be done today.
Come and sit down.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
I'll apologize.
Tell Tom I'm ready.
Tom wants to pay off the money he owes.
All things must pass.
Let's get in the truck.
I've never noticed that before.
I have no desire for that.
I think Tom was doing great.
I have a headache.
Tom looks a little squeamish.
I loved my wife to know how to cook.
I'm proud of my family.
Men have about 7 to 8 times more testosterone than women.
I have to go.
That was a good hat.
The door's stuck because of something.
Tom left right away.
I had lunch with her.
So much you've taught me.
What's bigger, the sun or the Earth?
We'll get you one.
No doubt!
Looks like you've lost ten pounds.
You disappointed me.
We'll get on it right away.
May I ask why?
I bought this yesterday.
You did a great job.
The fuse's over.
Are we safe now?
Tom says he'll do it someday.
By the way, what's your address?
This one's awkward.
She's wearing a gold chain around her neck.
Electronics provide multi-step and simple adaptation to air flow.
Have you heard that he's finally home?
During the bright days, we see the Mountain Fuji in the distance.
It's your choice.
They're sitting at the table.
It's a multiphase process.
I think you were very generous.
Tom could have something to do with it.
Are you dyslexic?
It's not working on me.
The Assembly is dissolved.
Tell me what you wrote.
It never occurred to me that someone would come up with something like that.
Tom was friendly with me.
I can't agree with you.
My father fixed the broken chair.
Let's move the closet.
Tom dropped me off at the airport.
You know, don't you?
I'm trying.
I wrote a song about Tatoebe.
I need to catch the train.
I'm not in a hurry.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
That's all I needed.
Let me try.
I paid for it.
I bought a new hat at the store.
I wouldn't hurt him.
I have complete confidence in you.
Have you ever listened to such good music?
It's okay.
I think you'll be able to do that.
Stop it, will you?
He kicked the ball in the goal!
Today is a big day, son!
We were filled with joyful anticipation.
It's just a personal attitude.
I'm really sorry, Tom.
Did you tell Tom this?
My older sister is very talented to sing.
I'm sorry, but I won't forget.
I've always thought it was weird.
Wipe your lips with a napkin.
Free library Haskel and Opera House were built on the border between Canada and the United States.
It's very important to rest properly.
You disappointed me.
You shouldn't eat right before you go to bed.
Karin is Austrian.
I think I understand you.
Tom's personal assistant has a personal assistant.
It was sitting alone.
You need to make a decision.
Whenever we talk, he makes my adrenaline work.
Tom's always very nice.
That takes courage.
I have no intention of answering all the questions.
Tom used to take the pain.
Stop smoking.
Do you know what that thing is?
Just tell Tom I called.
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
They gave water to their horses.
My father gave me a lot of money.
You can talk to Tom.
Is this all settled now?
Nothing's free.
Vladivostok is a city in Russia.
You were supposed to be my friend!
I wasn't too surprised.
I predicted this would happen months ago.
Did you write the report?
Tom turned the heat on.
I want to know the reason.
We'll catch up with you.
I don't usually buy anything from the Internet.
Someone was here.
Did you write in the Dnevnik today?
It's the best of everything I've ever heard.
Do you know anyone there who speaks Urdu?
Tom's been shot three times.
Come and pick me up.
Tom's smiling.
Are you sure this thing is safe?
Tom could explain it.
Let me help you.
Are you a baseball fan?
Why are you mad at me?
I didn't see anything.
We all receive blessings for the blessing of Her almighty Grace.
As far as I've been concerned, I still don't understand.
Tom's thinking the same thing.
I never borrow books or CDs to anyone.
That was kind of weird.
I don't have many friends.
My children rely on me.
I beg you to reconsider.
He can be treated.
Don't squirt.
When the French Revolution was experienced, citizens became free people, freed of traditions and churches, praised freedom, equality and brotherhood.
I didn't think it was appropriate.
Tom offered to help when it seemed like things had gone completely wrong.
Translation or not is a moral choice of translators, things sometimes sound better if they remain what they are in the language in which they are created.
Look at what I grew up in!
I'm not sure when Tom will be back.
It's necessary.
What did you do now?
I'm pathetic.
How long have you lived here?
Do you think the situation will improve?
If he doesn't risk it, he doesn't get it.
Don't stare.
J. Kepler, an astronomer and a mathematician, did research on planets and their movement.
That's enough for today.
I've never been to camping.
Bury Kalifa is today the highest cloudoder in the world.
I could help.
She was caught in action.
I think I know a way to save some time.
That was unfair.
It's a completely unique friendship that has been deepening for many years.
All right, I get it.
What are you looking for?
Are we all here?
Scientists believe that finding always comes like a lightning from the sky.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
The ship's crashed.
I agreed to buy it.
It came out of nowhere.
They know you.
Let's go one at a time.
Don't yell.
The ship disappeared without a trace.
It's precise.
I've never seen it before.
Did you enjoy watching the night game last night?
Their closeness was mysterious, considering they met only three days ago.
I've done that before.
What year was your car built?
I tried to be nice.
Don't sing.
It'd be good if I wore another layer.
What did I say, brother?
The keys are in the siphoner.
That's all we can do.
Are those your new shoes?
By what name?
Why don't you take your coat off?
Where the hell have you been?
She smiled.
Tom just couldn't do it.
I thought you were married.
I'll go if you go.
Well, I have some news.
The odds were against me.
I want to be with her.
What I saw was discourageing.
Did you tell Tom that Mary did this?
You tried.
Thank you for loving me.
I'm a big football fan.
You're making Tom nervous.
Keep working.
There are a lot of bad people in the world.
I thought you were happy here.
I'm natural.
I don't like dancing.
Don't forget to send this letter.
Nothing happens if his dreams aren't ahead of him.
I tried to be nice.
Tell him I'm innocent.
Tom imitates the way Mary talks.
Can you solve this problem?
Some of my friends are smoking.
You're my princess.
You'll miss everything.
Come on, sit down.
Tom's waiting.
Tom seems to think so.
Don't let Tommy sleep.
Come down here.
Excuse me?
Everyone changes.
Would you like some more apple juice?
We can't lose hope.
Let's sit down.
Buy a liter of milk, and if they have balls, buy twelve eggs.
Tom wants to know if you're planning on coming to his party.
Did you see me play?
Why would Tom want to do that?
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
Tom's very idiosyncrazic.
I'm hurt.
Keep digging.
I don't want any harm.
I was the only man in the tourist group, the rest of them were Arabs living in Istanbul.
Explore that.
Tom's not the right person to do the job.
We need to get better.
They're demanding an increase in wages.
Let me see your prescription.
Tom came to help.
Sometimes they stumble among families, they spread through generations.
Everything's upside down to him.
Tom thinks fast.
The Comments need to be on the topic.
Don't go away.
The programme lays down conditions for the development and implementation of projects.
We should go again.
Are you feeling okay today?
We won.
Give me the spoon.
Can I find you on Facebook?
I tried to be kind.
It would be confusing.
Here we are.
You can sit next to me.
That's what pulled the handle.
Tom was a great manager.
Everybody's tapping.
All you have to do is practice.
Have you ever mugged a cow?
There's a lot of orange fishermen on the river.
You just need to write a few sentences about what you did yesterday.
I couldn't get on the train because there were so many people.
Could you please turn off the radio for me?
Come again.
She's walking.
Why are you still awake?
Tom was a scout.
What's this mess about?
Tom counted the change.
I learned hard when I was in school.
I said no, Tom.
Should we tell anyone?
After five hours on the hot sand, he saw something on the horizon that looked like a desert fatamorgan.
When are you coming to the station?
Are you honest?
We'll try your way.
Are you a maniac?
I'll be better now.
And that's it!
I made an apple pie.
Are you a prisoner?
No one's been watching.
If you have to be somewhere right now, it's definitely here!
Tom could be lying.
Good luck.
I've never regretted it.
Tom was as angry as a ris.
Tom could have got a point.
Am I welcome here?
What did you both do?
Don't yell.
What an experience!
Tom's learning how to program.
Are we done here?
Tom's a little eccentric.
Mary came back from school in tears because her friends were teasing her.
I trusted you with my secret and you betrayed me.
I'm writing real fast.
We all did that.
Maybe you're wrong.
I'm sure you'll understand.
I have to pay off my debt.
Which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.
His speech was, by the way, a catastrophe.
We need to save money to buy a new car.
Bad things are going to happen.
I thought you'd already taken care of that.
What age is your car?
You have to believe it's possible it's going to change.
She translated her sentence.
Did you even ask Tom to use it?
I could go there now.
Everyone was cheering.
Tom said you were cool.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
I'm glad you answered.
Drive carefully.
Let's see.
Do you have a perfume?
Don't play a monkey!
Mary's a little attractive.
He's making such a grimas that you want to hit him.
Be careful.
You understand me.
Tom wanted to know what we were doing.
When shouting doesn't help, shout louder!
I think you should talk to Tom about this.
Tom arrived in time despite the storm.
Something was wrong.
Tom said I was reckless.
Tom wanted to take Mary's phone number, but she refused to give it to him.
I'm asking someone to do it for me.
You're still inexperienced.
We're gonna have a great time.
Not bad.
He asked me to help him.
It's hot in here.
Have you fully recovered?
Tom wore black jeans and a white shirt.
The book cost five dollars.
Is it that simple?
Tom's not like the rest of the boys.
Listen to this.
How much is that worth?
I was lucky to have survived the accident.
No one I know goes there anymore because it's a big crowd.
I'm learning Korean.
I'm losing.
I don't want to see him again.
I'm glad Tom left.
I buy a lot of stuff in that store.
Drive slowly.
Tom must have had the key.
Why is that interesting?
Are you involved in this?
I'm sure Tom didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
You're the reason I came here.
Tom probably hates me, too.
You can sit with me.
Oh, gray kitten, please don't come over.
Just give me a chance.
What are you laughing at?
How many people were there?

Why don't you come over sometime?
We all did that.
What did you do now?
Answer me now.

It would be nice to have you wait for me.

I want to meet Tom.

Do I seem to be?
That's how I realized.

Come.
What are you implying?
Tom wrote down Mary's phone number.
It's a good chance we'll win.
The meeting took an hour.

Go upstairs.
That doesn't matter.
I'll teach you how to write.
The mileage depends on the conditions on the road.
Don't fight.
What did you do now?

Everything's gonna be all right in the end, if it's not okay, then it's not even the end.
Move, folks.
Are you sarcastic?
Where did you find this knife?
Speak for yourself, Tom.
We shouldn't make fun of others.

Can I take your dictionary?
Tom ate the whole box of chocolate himself.
Can we do this later?
The truth has to be said.
Do you like costumes?
Haven't you done enough?
What do you know about me?
I think he's very smart about that.
Does that mean you love me?
This is never gonna end.
We have a serious problem.
Can we go somewhere to talk?
Explain it in simple words.

Who else uses this room?
You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
He's tired of reading.
Can we order now?
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't even think he'd try to convince Mary to do it for a second.
Hey, give me a chance.
There's also an ethical question that's been asked about this.
It just happened again.
They all survived.
Bad things are going to happen.
Do you love your mother?
I'm really proud of that.
This is my third marriage.
What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
I totally disagree with that.
It's a routine thing.
He's trying.
Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than me.
There's nothing going behind my hand today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my children.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it was too small.
I didn't wash my hair.

We have enough seats for everyone.
It was a false alarm.
Tom's learning how to program.
Anyone can get the wax.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
I want Tom to leave by noon.
Tom seemed amazed.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
It won't help if you worry.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I've been looking for you.
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
I'm taking the day off.
Do you blame me?
That broke the mood at the table yesterday.
I thought you were going to the Boston bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I wish I knew what was going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had a problem sleeping.
It's locked.
I'll think of something.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care of yourself!
I'm not going to try to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?
Is everything settled now?
Please send me the doctor's account.
What's this about?
Have a good day, Tom.
Are you going to Tom and Mary's wedding?
I'm a little new in this.
I improvised.
"Do you know what's going on?" - "No. What's the matter?"
That's what both of them like.
You and I need to talk.
You spyed on me.
The pen I'm writing belongs to Tom.
Where did you see Tom?
It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?
Wake up!
We help each other.
Tom and Mary stayed good friends.
How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
How do you know that?
Tom suffocated the smile.
I'm scared.
In what name?
Is Tom really a student here?
Tom's the one who wrote this story.
Everyone's going.
I didn't spend anything.
It's a area with a lot of new houses.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom seemed pretty nervous.
Tom likes sports.
Tom took the wig off.
I guess I'm right.
Her name was unknown.
I'm going to prepare Tom.
Stay away from my girlfriend.
I'm sorry I tried.
I'm not bitter at all.
Jumi's one of my friends.
He just needed some time.
I thought you wouldn't do that.
Sorry I'm so late.
Maria's getting stripped.
And worse, and down.
Life without love doesn't make any sense.
I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
I'm firm against this.
You underestimate me.
Tom almost never makes mistakes when he writes French.
The police did not reject the possibility of suicide.
This was on the list.
She fantasized about becoming a nurse.
Come here, young man.
This should work.
The hard work was worth it.

I was just thinking about you.

Tom could beat up anyone.
I'm doing my best here.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
The government has fallen.
Tom took a sip of wine.
This will take forever.
I'm so excited.
I'm here to play baseball.
I'll tell you everything I know.
Don't stop.
Close the window.
Tom missed the target.
I totally disagree with you.
You're out of the way.
Let me do it again.
They live there.
This book will help you write efficiently.
Don't talk.
Tom made a fool of himself when he was drunk last night.
I work in Milan.
Come back in one day.
It had a rather different effect than intended.
I'm surprised by Tom's answer.
Everyone's laughing.
I loved going to the beach.
Where's your father?
I'd agree.
It's all over.
The book is sold out.
Tom almost died trying to save me.
That's what the truth needs.
I loved going to the beach.
At first glance, it looks easy.
It's time to say goodbye.
You were supposed to be my friend!
People need to stop hatred.
I don't doubt he's gonna make it.
I never advised you to do that.
I don't intend to change.
Tom started the car.
My grandmother by his father enjoys the tea ceremony.
She smiled.
They deceived everything.
Are you coming back now?
Tom kept it a secret.
We went to school together.
We're doing this wrong.
We'll get you one.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
In accordance with our rules, all participants must inspect the identification, registration papers and licenses.

It's over there.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Just stay with me.
I forgot to write a name on my exam.
Does Tom have a key?
Tom's getting ready.
You always work.
In chess, there are situations in which it is worth sacrificing a figure to gain a long-term advantage.
Young children should learn to sympathize with animals.
You're not finished yet?
You're not the one who died.
That's hard to imagine.
Are you sarcastic?
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
She's walking.
My mother loves music.
Would that be possible?
What did you two do?
Draw a sketch of your house.
Tom postponeed his drink.
I'm pretty shocked about this.
The tray's empty.
Tom decided against it.
I'm grateful.
I couldn't do this without your help.
Don't answer.
If you did it for me, it would help a lot.
He was naked chest and boson.
Tom could be honest with you.
Can you explain how to get to the airport?
Look again.
The first step is always the hardest.
They have to drink water.
Now I'm a little worried.
What's in there, Tom?
Help yourself.
I'm completely broke.
Tom hates Mary.
Can I borrow your pen for a second?
Don't let her get in your head.
My right hand is numb.
That's enough!
I sell coffee.
Tom worked with me once.
Stop it!
Tom jumped into the water, and he didn't take off his clothes.
I'm a little crazy.
I'll be happy to say yes.
Every bird flies to his flock.

I know it's illegal.
I was studying hard when I was in school.

They differ like heaven and earth.
Tom was all alone.
The cavalry's here.
Everyone's getting some sleep.
Tom begged Mary to say nothing to his parents.
Would you like to come with me?
Tom's family lives in Boston.
I liked that one.
Al lived in the Soviet Union, that great and multinational, in the large region of the Tver, by the size of several English countries.
Tom can be dangerous.
Are these your bags?
What have you done to me?
Don't jump!
When he was six years old, he learned to knock on a typewriter, and told his teacher he shouldn't learn to write with his hand.
I've been practicing.
That doesn't sound very convincing, but I believe you.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
Can we talk outside, please?
You have good instincts.
I thought I acted well.
Am I safe now?
Please write.
We didn't have this planned for you.
Tom's selling the car.
He started screaming.
Tom was visiblely shaken.
Did you see who that was?
I didn't know you were so rich.
I'll never see her again.
Everybody down!
I could talk to Tom.
Do you believe in God?
We kissed last night.
Was I truly so happy?
Tom never had to do that.
You don't often hear someone buy a hat for a thousand dollars.
Come here.
That's what I'm used to.
Do you doubt me?
Tom's been working his whole life.
What language do they speak in Mexico?
That's what both of them like.
Something's come up.
Help, police, help!
I ordered it already.
I'm sure I'm gonna miss Tom a lot.
What's your name?
Where did you get that?
Tom's a really nice kid.
I can't concentrate on this mess.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Swimming is a kind of exercise.
The government fell after the parliamentary vote.
I want to be a swimmer.
Shall we see Tom again?
When did you have time to do that?
I don't have many friends.
We don't know what brings tomorrow.
What first instrument did you learn to play?
I'm stunned.
There's nothing left.
Have you ever written a computer program?
I'm not losing hope.
I have a plan.
You took my place.
Tom's one of the most interesting guys I've ever worked with.
Do you think Tom would want to go camping with us next weekend?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Drive safe.
Did I ask you?
How long did Tom stay?
People tell me things.
To hell!
Tom's in his pajamas.
Did Tom believe your story?
I was very tired, so I went to sleep early.
It's hard.
Tom thought I was lying.
I don't want anything from you.
How's that going?
Don't fight with me.
Tom's also a salesman.
I want to feel important.
We'd give everything so that it wouldn't happen.
I think Tom needs help.
Switzerland needs better apples.
Are you involved in this?
Everyone stands.
I pretended I didn't know Tom.
It's never a piece of shit can be golden so it doesn't stink.
Don't rush it.
No one can ever know everything.
I'm objective.
I'll leave early today.
Are my red ears?
He's not a doctor.
That's enough.
How much instruments can you play?
Employees can be motivated by good, fair wages, a chance to work in a good team or on exciting tasks, and with clear economic incentives such as bonuses and prospects of advancement.
I doubt I'm the only one who noticed.
That's encouraging news.
Pass me the sugar, please.
I'm really sorry about this.
You're funny.
Merry Christmas!
Have you ever seen one?
We had a lot to drink.
It's too loud for me here.
I doubt it'll be hard for you to get a license.
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Is it all settled now?
How can mathematics, which is only a product of human thoughts independent of experience, so amazingly adapted to objects in reality?
Look at that.
Turns out Tom's a sincere person.
I didn't know you were so rich.
Look at this.
The code is Muriel.
I had a quick lunch.
He took that chance.
His wife patched his shirt.
Someone told me about it.
Swallow your pride!
To change red meat, I cooked turkey breasts in mushroom sauce for tonight.
I'm always hated.
Tom's fighting like a madman.
I've always liked horror movies.
Something just came up.
I couldn't stop crying.
You're fattened.
They're not mine.
I'm doubleing the price.
Could you do that?
It was made a video of the interview and it was posted online.
Tom was drunk and drowned his sorrow after that night of drunkenness.
Why don't we take a break for a while?
Go take a look.
Tom just wanted to say something.
It's over.
Is it true that Tom killed himself?
I'm here to play baseball.
Do you think so?
I didn't do that either.
Do you have anything to report?
I say it all the time.
Don't lie.
Will you take that?
I just got here.
Is Tom coming back?
You're smart.
How did I get here?
Why?
Tom dropped his silenced breath.
There's a lot of work to do before I go home.
By the way, where do you live?
Do you have any questions?
It's hard for me to understand French when it's quick to speak.
It's almost 3:30.
They'll know.
Tom bought a couple of black shoes yesterday.
I have many friends.
Cirih is considered one of the large financial centers.
That's very rare.
Tom wanted to be good.
I'm just not in a hurry.
Don't look.
How desperate are you?
Let's not wander around.
It doesn't get any worse.
Answer me.
I'm still making mistakes.
Tom's got a tough job to do.
I'm happy we won.
You can't go in that room.
"Are you feeling better?" "No, I'm worse."
It's all passing, but beautiful memories live.
I was in the mountains.
It's heavy.
Which one's easier?
Did you wash the dishes?
We had a big fight.
It was a drop that spilled the glass.
He doesn't like us.
We'd save time if we'd landed through Park Street.
A cop arrested him for driving drunk.
We'll be out of our minds.
That would be great.
The knife is not sharp.
We hope people like it.
We all have a price.
That gave it an idea.
I got lucky.
No one knows me in Boston.
Tom thinks there's something wrong with some politicians.
Where's Tehran?
Run over any obstacle with this truck monster!
Mary spends a lot of time on the phone, sending messages and e-mails to her friends.
He always wears dark clothes.
Luck was on our side.
Tom works for his father's company.
I want to help you.
We never lose hope.
Men stay kids their whole lives.
Now we need the truth.
I should be here all afternoon.
Didn't I teach you anything?
Why do you ask?
It's big.
The quick that's the short.
Come sit next to me.
I got him a book.
I barely managed to hide my bitterness because of her arrogance.
Buter's made of milk.
There's nothing we can do about it.
Everything's getting better.
Anything you want to see in particular?
I miss her.
I passed my exam!
Let us help you.
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
Please don't yell.
Does he still have a fever?
Tom was crazy, you know.
Tom put the map on the table.
Who are you running from?
What did you do to me?
I'll talk to Tom about this.
I'm still a little tired.
We can't go back.
We'll visit you from time to time.
Tom didn't have the courage to do what he wanted.
His comment is easy to understand in the wrong way.
