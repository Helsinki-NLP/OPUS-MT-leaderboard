Members of the Valijan Assembly are concerned that they are “like Mupetka”
Some members of the congregation are threatened by the proposal to be appointed by the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, the former member of the Valican Parliament).
This came as a result of plans for the name of the Assembly to be changed into the Valican Parliament.
Members of the congregation throughout the political spectrum are concerned to smile.
A member of the Assembly of the types of laburists said they were concerned in their group, “because the name is rhyme with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in the valley twp means silly and pwp poops.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said that their group as a whole "not satisfied" and proposed other options.
Valizanian conservative said that his group of “open spirit” regarding the change of name, at the same time noted that between the MWP and Muppet words there is a small difference in the statement.
In this context, the pronouncement of the Valijan letter “w” is similar to the pronouncement of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire term.
The Commission, currently preparing a draft legislation to present changes in the name, said: “The final decision on possible discryptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be adopted by members alone.”
By law of the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Valijan Assembly was authorised to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Valican Parliament.
For members of the Assembly, the Commission has chosen the name “Welsh Parliament” or “WMP”, but in public consultation, the most support has been given to “MWP”.
The members of the Assembly are clearly proposing other options, but reaching a consensus will be a difficult task for President-in-Office Elin Jones, which has to submit a draft amendment legislation within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes in the way the congregation works, including rules on the incompatibility of the function of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their term.
Macedonians decide to change the name of the country by referendum
Voices will vote on Sunday whether they will change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
They want to resolve a decades long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its province called Macedonia.
The Athens have long insisted that their northern neighbour's name represents the right to their territory and have repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, the opponent of plebiscites on the change of name, said he would not take into account the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change in the name is the price they must pay for joining the EU and Nato.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church were bent because the churches in Harlem deal with problems
“The older people I talked to say that sometimes there were bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“Not one's in one another today.”
He explained that the disappearance of bars was understandable.
“Today people socialize differently.
The bars are no longer the living room of the neighbors where people regularly leave."
In churches, however, he is concerned that money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will soon be again at the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by housing buildings with a common administration (condomies), where people who will not help refugees in the neighbourhood who remain.
“The large majority of people who will buy condomins in these buildings will be white people”, he said, “and the day will come soon when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that the people who move into these condoms will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolitan – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s decade later.
The original white methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building took over the black religious community, which served a goddess nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the direction of honored John Howard Johnson, who on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, led a boycott of sellers who refused to hire or support darkeners.
The fire in 1939 was severely damaged by the building, but when the parishes planned the restoration of the father Johnson, they ordered bells to run.
To honor David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s church, he proudly named the bells “bells for poor people”.
The expert who raced in July called them a little differently: “Cultural treasure” and“extraordinary historical instrument”.
The expert Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also stressed that these are the first race bells to be played by a darkball musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to churches Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he drove to bigger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced in St. Martin’s church.
In the church of St. Martin’s, a complicated story with architects and contractors has been held in recent months; some have brought church laics and other bishops.
Crystia – the administrative authority of the parish composed of Laikov – wrote to the bishop in July to worry that the bishop would "try to transfer the costs" to the parish, although the parish was not included in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency by the bishop.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old during lobster hunting in California
Officials report that he attacked and injured 13-year-olds during lobster hunting at the opening of the lobster hunting season on Saturday in California.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near the beach Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about half an hour in Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then he sailed to him with the group and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy was only thrilled because he caught the lobster and then found out that he was screaming “He bit me!
He bit me!
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had the whole key torn apart.
“I cried all to go out of the water: “There is a shark in the water!” he added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The water savior, Captain Larry Giles, said in the press statement that several weeks earlier, the shark was observed in this area, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe damage to the upper part of the body.
Responsible for 48 hours disabled access from the beach Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s beach in Ecinitas due to investigation and safety.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsburys plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury's coming to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beautiful corners, as they have in the mills, and with professional staff.
As part of entering the British beauty market worth 2.8 billion GBP and growing while selling clothes and household apparatus falls, the larger beauty corners will be tested in 11 stores around the country and in several stores next year, if they prove to be successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used earlier for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
At Sainsbury’s, they say they will double their beauty products on 3,000 products and include marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of the brand L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space in areas with trade marks similar to those in stores such as Boots.
Supermarket also revives its boutique offer of cosmetic products, so that most products are vegan – something that younger buyers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the sale of Fragrant Shop perfumes will test the concession in two Sainsburys stores. The first was opened in Croydon in southern London, and the other one opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham by the end of the year.
Due to online shopping and daily purchase of smaller quantities of food in local shops, supermarkets must work harder to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, the CEO at Sainsbury’s, said that retail stores would be similar to the big dealers, as the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl discontoms with several services and non-life products.
Sainsbury’s group opened the outlets of Argos in hundreds of shops and also Habitat trades, since she bought both chains two years ago, which increased the sales of food, and the downloads were more profitable.
The previous supermarket attempts to rebuild their cosmetic and pharmaceutical sections ended unable.
Sainsbury’s shared the Boots chain at the beginning of the 21st century, but the bond ended after the dispute on the distribution of profits from drugs in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s 125 million-year-old GBP sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
They stated that Lloyds would play a role in this plan, as in four stores, they would extend the offer of luxury brands for the care of the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, a commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: “We have changed our appearance and impression of our beauty corners and thus improved the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained associates who will be available for counseling.
Our offer of a brand is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and the appropriate locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that presents a challenge for the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "beat" because Holly Willoughby has retreated from work worth 11 million pounds
The star shows Dragons Den (Good business) furious because TV leader Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from the job, worth 11 million pounds, with its brand of lifestyle to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of clothes and supplements Truly.
The business couple was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The head of this morning, 37, announced on Instagram that it was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of Dragons Den Peter Jones, as she last moment had withdrawn from their profitable business with a brand of lifestyle to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources say that Jones was “bearing” when a golden little television girl was on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admits that because of her new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – there is no longer enough time to devote their brands of clothing and supplements to Truly.
The company was compared to a brand of Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and predicted to double its assets, estimated to 11 million GBP.
When the 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram to leave Truly's brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which to survive the next two decades.
Her decision to retire was completely amazed by all the involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was going on because the opening was so close.
The warehouse is full of goods ready for sale in Marlowe.”
Professionals believe that the departure of the head of this morning, which is among the most interesting associations for banks in Britain, would cost several million for large investment in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and supplements, and additional delays in opening.
In addition, this may mean the end of long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly along with Cappova in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
They rested together, and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S trademark and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the ITV broadcast I’m A Celebrity.
The source near Jones yesterday said: “We will not comment on his businesses.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about criticism of the media for commenting, which seems to some as "unprecedent" and a positive opinion on the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in like that?
Trump said with his mocking "novinar" voice:
"I didn't give up anything."
His first meeting in Singapore in June marked Trump as a major step against the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly meeting that North Korea did not see the "exercive response" of the US on previous North Korean disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead, the United States continues to sanctions with which the pressure continues.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results – they stopped the missile testing, helped free the hostages and brought home the remains of the American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in the conversation on relations with Kim.
“It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this loaded full scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said and pointed to the crowd right in front of you.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, hundreds of dead
In elimination of the consequences of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs have been told that they do not need their assistance.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lomboka have been moved, natural disasters have not been declared, which is a condition for sending international aid.
"In many cases, they were sadly very clear not to require international assistance, so the situation is a little complicated," Sumbung said.
Save The Children's organization consists of a team that will travel to Pala, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can help on the ground.
Sutop, representative of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials assess the situation in Paluo and determine whether they will allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are permanent, the state remains completely unprepared for the anger of nature.
In Aceh, they built shelters after tsunami, but on other shores, it is not common practice.
The absence of a warning siren for tsunami in Palui has likely contributed to the loss of life, even though the warning was valid.
Traveling among many Indonesian islands is also a challenge at best.
The natural disaster makes logistics even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is to help victims of the earthquake in Lombok, sails against Paluj, but will last at least three days to arrive at the place of a new catastrophe.
President Joko Widododo put the improving of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure to the front of his electoral campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit is a problem for Yok's administration in re-election next year.
Joko is also facing the pressure of long-term tensions between sects in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and ten thousand evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, bowls and arrows and other primitive weapons.

I saw Kante coming, so after one touch, I had no more thought and simply decided to shoot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the midst with a hit by Belgian player Eden Hazard in 25 minutes.
In this action, the blue attacker handed the ball back to Mate Kovačić and ran into Liverpool's half.
The coin was in the middle fast and stepped forward.

Number of death victims of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of death victims of earthquake and tsunamia in Indonesia increased to 832, the State Agency for accidents reported on Sunday morning.
The representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told the press conference that many people were due to the 7,5th degree earthquake of Friday, which triggered the six-metre waves captured in the ruins of buildings.
The Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is sprayed with ruins of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man for murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The police initiated a murder investigation after they found a woman's body in Birkenhead this morning in Merseyside.
The 44-year-old with stab wounds found at 7.55 in the building Grayson Mews on John Street and for the suspicion of murder, arrested a 32-year-old man.
The police call on everyone who was in the area and anything they saw or heard to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in the initial stage, but I invite everyone near John Street Street in Birkenhead, and they saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
I also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on the camera videos to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
The police officer confirmed that Birkenhead is a woman's resident, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene of the crime who thought they knew a woman and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations take place, and police officers inform their wives.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one should enter the building or leave the building.
When he found out what happened, he lost his word.
The inhabitants were now told that it could take hours before they could enter again.
The police officer heard how he explained to the man that the entire area is now being treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
It keeps saying "that's so terrible".
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one was right outside.
Many police officers stood inside the Cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with any information requests to write on @MerPolCC shall call 101 or anonymously to Criplaceppers on number 0800 555 111 and list the daily 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell’s statue in parliament has become the most recent memory target of the "rewal writing history" dispute.
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many English cultural and religious artefacts by fanatic puritanism advocates.
But Cromwell Society marked Crick's proposal as "stupidness" and "the attempt of rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s discussion of the removal of statues, it became clear that Oliver Cromwell’s image outside the West Ministerial Palace would become a target. ”
The Iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars Cromwell had neither been ordered nor executed.
For his ancestor’s actions in the past century, Cromwell may be sacrificed wrong.
The wonderful presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a witness of the 19th century opinion and is part of a historian for a personality that some think is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith said for The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella many (maybe even more in the late 19th century than today) sees as a guardian of Parliament against external pressure, of course in his case of monarchy.
Is this a very precise performance, the subject of continuous historical debates.
Clearly, in the middle of the 17th century, the conflict has formed a further development of our people, and Cromwell is a recognized individual representing one side of this division.
His achievements from the time when Lord was a protector also deserve celebration and memory."
Killing pig crushed Chinese peasant to death
After reporting local media on the southwest market, China pigs attacked and killed farmers.
The man identified only by the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a sliced artery and covered with blood near the pork in the town of Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou was reported in the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A breeze of pigs is prepared to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province in China.
After reporting, a relative would travel from the neighbouring province Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the next pork was open.
He said there was a big pig pig in the pork with a bloody mushroom.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig has crushed the peasant to death.
“The legs of the Brother were bloody and welded” were quoted by the cousins with the surname “Wu” at the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his or his cousins.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were shut down so he wouldn't attack anyone else while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and market leadership are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although rarely, the cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and a man suffered severe physical injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a valian farmer at the tractor, but then the woman removed the animal.
After a few pigs ate from Oregon in 2012, some other farmer from Manitoba for CBC News said that pigs are usually not attacking, but the taste of blood can act as a "incinerator".
“We'd just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
It is only necessary to show them sufficient respect," he said.
In the United States of Southwest because of the remains of the Rosa Orkan comes heavy rain
According to the forecasts, Orkan Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and bad.
In the next days, however, Rosa will bring floods in the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa has been in the hurricane of 1st category from 5:00 a.m. since the eastern hour, with wind speed 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers south-west from Punte Eugenie in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, the Pacific Ocean strengthens the area of low air pressure moving east towards the West Coast of the United States. Rosa will be approaching the Baja California halfway as a tropical storm in Monday and pushing high tropical moisture towards the north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up up to 250 mm rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture, which will mix with low air pressure area, will create abundant drops in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, between 25 and 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, flooding and the possibility of ground beaches in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, the amount of drops in some cities will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour, particularly in the parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest parts, particularly above the larger part of Arizona, it is expected to fall from 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to rapid deterioration of the situation due to the devastating nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very unthinkable to walk into the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Strong rains can transform canyons into rivers, and storms will bring local winds and dust in the air.
The nearest low air pressure area will bring local rains to the parts of Southern California.
The drops above 12 mm are possible, which may lead to a smaller delay in flooding and crawling roads.
This will be the first rain for the region during the rainy period.
A few scattered tropical panels will start approaching Arizona late Saturday afternoon and on Monday morning, late on Monday and on Tuesday.
The strong rains will spread all over the sky on Tuesday and will last on Wednesday.
In the United States, the Arctic is cooling and the tropical areas remain warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures in short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of a dramatic difference in the temperature in the central part of the US.
It is also found to be in the city of San Francisco.
In the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stand up and expand again.
Most of the Middle and Eastern US will enter the warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, there could be 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees more than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good opportunities for temperatures above the eastern US in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people saw an interesting Thursday's testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault, which was expected to occur in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political path continued, since television stations interrupted the regular programme due to a Friday's conversion in the last minute: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, in order to carry out the FBI's unit investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Justice Board that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was in a wine state and tried to take her off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said he was 100% convinced that it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are supposed to be seen on Friday.
The company counted the average rating of CBS TV networks, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Chanel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available immediately for other networks that performed the testimony, including PBS networks, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in offices.
For a easier performance, ratings are similar to those in the performance of the final football game or award awards of the American Film Academy.
The Fox News Channel television, which leaders strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, leads to all networks of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
The second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.2 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
After hearing, the interest also remained high.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican declared that he would vote in front of Kavanough, CNN and CBS cameras took pictures of the protesters screaming at him when he tried to enter the elevator in order to participate in the hearings of the Justice Committee on Friday morning.
During the construction, he increased the view, which was captured live by the CNN cameras.
“I stand here before you”, a woman told him.
“You think he speaks the truth to the country?
You have power while many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office made a statement, and he added that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the doors were closed.
All TV networks were live even hours later when the Justice Committee voted on the surrender of Kavanaugh's appointment to vote in the Senate.
But Flake said it would only be done if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate in the next week, to which the minority party of Democrats called.
Flake was partly convinced to talk to a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators after that, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was decided, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the US Federal Investigative Office (FBI) on charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused the criticism of "playing political games" at Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused in an interview for the Sunday Times of criticism of her plans for exit from the European Union "playing political games" with the British future and underminement of national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Therese May to the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson staged his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said that the proposal that Britain and the EU paid customs was another “completely absurd”.
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of the death of the LSU team player
The police arrested the suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of the LSU team.
After the report from the Baron Rouge police, the 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison for second-degree murder charges.
Officials posted a video of a face-to-face encounter between Simps and Simpson and the police indicated that he lost his sunglasses during the fight, Sims.
The police found sunglasses at the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS TV complements WAFB TV reports.
After Simpson's hearing, the police filed a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
Security is 350,000 USD, reports the lawyer.
A viewer from the district of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday, which states that the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the neck.
The police are thanking the special unit for the refugees of the Louisian State Police, the criminal lab, the police of the Southern University and the population of the area.
The Sports Director of the LSU team, Joe Alleva, thanked the local authorities for their "carefulness and search for justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
A 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
On average, the previous season included 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps to the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade trainer said that the team was "treated" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
“This is what you worry all the time”, Wade said.
Vulcan vomiting ash at Ciudad de Mexico
The ash, vomited by the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern neighbourhood of the Mexican capital.
In Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans not to approach volcano, as the activity in the crater increased and recorded 183 gas and ash releases in 24 hours.
The center was watching several cases of bushes and earthquake suns.
Pictures on social networks were displayed by thin layers of ash covering the windscreen of cars in the neighbourhoods of the capital of Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysics observed an increased volcano activity lying 72 kilometers southeast of the main town after the 7-1 degree earthquake in September 2017 shaken down Central Mexico.
The Vulcan called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police dealing with catalonic separatists before the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who supported independence faced counter-inflammatory police units and a thousand people joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the Catalonic polarised separation vote.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, held by anti-extreme police units, was harnessed by eggs and metal paint in powder, creating dark clouds of dust on streets, usually flooded with tourists.
Later, police officers had to use the bandts to stop the fights.
Independence supporters, who have called for more hours “without forgetting, without forgiveness”, faced protesters who support unity and screamed “Let Spain live!”.
According to local media, 14 people received more damage in protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which was declared illegal in Madrid, and the catalon separatists celebrated it, tensions in the region that supports independence remain.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the participation was low, as the opponents of the separation have largely boycotted the elections.
According to the Catalon authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded last year after police tried to stop the continuation of voting in the region in violent conflicts.
Groups supporting independence camped overnight before the voters to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to pick another way.
68-year-old Narciss Termes, an electrician, who took part in the separatist protest along with his wife, said he no longer hoped that Catalonia would become independent.
“We experienced one of our best moments last year.
I watched my parents crying from luck because they could choose, but we were stuck now," he said.
Despite the importance, even though the closest victory in the regional elections last December, the catalonic parties supporting independence have difficulty maintaining the initiative this year, as many of the most famous leaders in voluntary exile are waiting for trial for their role in the organisation of a referendum and a later declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who filmed a protest with the phone in support of the police, explained that the protest was triggered by politics on both sides.
“The tension is steady,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalon leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year before the trial, announced that he will run in elections in the European Parliament next year.
"To run in European elections is the best way to condemn regression in democratic values and oppression that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: arrested men who flew into the house with a car
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested because they flew in a house in Londonderry with a car several times.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 19:30 at the British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they're supposed to be shooting a car with a crossbow.
With a hit by Mengai, Livingston won 1:0 against Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston wins
Livingston was amazed by the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to admit his second defeat in 18 games as a coach of the club from Ibrox.
The Dolly Mengai's arrow took care of the difference, as Gary Holt's team was equaled with the Hibernian team elsewhere.
Gerrard's team has thus lost victory in guests in this year's championship, and the next week, Hearts, leading on the ladder and behind eight points.
Rapid Vienna's Rapid Vienna team will be hosted in the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston increased his series of undefeatedness in the division to the sixth game and the main coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced defeat.
Livingston wasted his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should be leading a lot before the hit, because with their directness, Rangers were causing a number of problems.
Scott Robinson managed to break in, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit the doorway, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The guests left the Rangers game because they knew they could be dangerous for guests when they were interrupted in the attack.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingstone a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and hit the middle of the criminal space.
The Rangers had a bigger possession of the ball, but domestic defenses couldn't break it, and the doorman Liam Kelly had not had much work to do.
This sample continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos raped Kelly's defense.
The Rangers' doorman Allan McGregor choked Scott Pittman's shot with his foot, and Lithgow shot from another Livingston break in the attack by naked.
The proposals continued to come to Livingstone's penal space, but the domestics rejected all attacks, and two offences – Halkett's violation over the replacement of Glenn Middleton and the offence to play with his hand – but the judge did not judge.
“Great performance” Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena stadium
It's a great show and a score for Livingston.
They were purely all excellent and continue to surpass expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the station has not changed much from their return to the top, but Holt must be attributed to the credit for how he woke the team from his arrival.
It was a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well distributed the excellent organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral ready all the time.
Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although under Gerrard's leadership, they are extremely short of these standards.
There was a lack of gunshots on the goal – only once they successfully defeated host defence – and this is some kind of awakening for the Rangers, which were found in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan accepts mixed in Kolen
On Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue sky prevailed.
Today, the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany is aimed at improving NATO's relations.
There have been disputes on human rights, freedom of press and Turkish accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Köln to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home for the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented the 25,000 heads of the crowd from collecting from mosque, but many supporters were able to get closer to seeing their president.
He also expressed his opinion by hundreds of protesters -- many Kurds – who do not support Erdogan's governments and condemned Erdogan's politics and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the separation of the visitor, which some German Turks celebrate as heroes and others despise as autocracy.
An accident on the road in Deptford: the biker crashed in a car race
In London, the bicycle crashed in the race in which the car was involved.
The accident happened near the crossroads between the streets of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the road in Deptford in the southeast of the city at approximately 10.15 at the British summer time.
The car driver stopped and rescued, but the man died at the scene.
The accident occurred only a few months after the bicycle died in a race where the car driver fled on Childers Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash.
The police made a statement that police officers are checking out the identity of the man so they can inform their own.
They set up road blocks and rerouted bus lines, and they advised motorists to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in the incident
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a strictly protected man's prison, reports from the prison administration.
The riot broke out in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9:30 after the British summer time and still takes place.
They called the police specialists from the Tornado unit to provide for an accident involving eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards had less injuries on their face on their own.
The representative of the prison staff said: “We have called specially trained personnel to provide for an accident in HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six staff members suffered damage.
In our prisons, we do not tolerate violence and it is clear that the police will be held responsible for it and therefore they may be further behind bars."
In prison, HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
June reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison called an anti-exploratory police unit to intervene in a serious incident in which personnel were attacked with pool bullets.
Orkan Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (which may be useful for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is probably going to happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remaining energy of the Rosa Orkana is pushing its way through the southwest of the desert and bringing the danger of sudden floods.
The National Time Service has already issued warnings against sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, South and Eastern Nevada, South Eastern California and Utah, including the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The Orkan Rosa is supposed to get mad over Phoenix on Tuesday, and he'll be getting close to Monday with rain.
The National Time Service in Phoenix wrote in the tweet that only “the ten tropical ciclons have maintained the status of tropical storms or depression within 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950!
The Orkan Katrina (1967) has raged the good 60 kilometers from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Centre for Orcanes predict 50 to 100 mm of drops with individual drops up to 150 mm on Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other southwest desert areas, including Rockies and Great Basin, it is expected from 25 to 50 mm of rainfalls, individual drops to 100 mm are possible.
For areas outside the dangers of sudden floods, the Rosa Orkana rain may be a blessing because the region has affected the drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the fallins will probably be useful, as the southwest currently takes a dried period.
“After the US Tracking Centre, the good 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The Rosa Oracle's path leads first to the land of the Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, which still has the power of an orcan with the maximum wind speed of 137 km/h on Sunday morning, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and moves north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
The land in Mexico is expected to reach with the power of tropical storms on Monday afternoon or evening.
The falls in the parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California halfway to the Northwest of Sonor we expect 75 to 150 mm rainfalls with the possibility of 250 mm rainfalls”, reports were reported on the weather site.com.
Orkan Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours in Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and towards South Utah until the late night of Tuesday.
“The biggest danger we expect from Rosa or its remains is a lot of rain in the Baja Califonia peninsula in the northwest of Sonora and in the United States of Southwest deserts,” said the national center for Orcane.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening sudden floods and floods in deserts and ground beaches in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-old men were arrested for the suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old in Somerset with stab wounds.
The wounded teenager was found in Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4.00 at the British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains “stable”.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested at the area of Radstock at night, reports the police from Avon and Summerset.
Police officers are calling everyone who may have caught the event with their cell phone to report.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “treated animosity and anger” of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the insubordination and undecided tactics of the Democratic Party”, Trump said at the meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh “patied animosity and anger” by the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh witnessed the convention, and clearly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford’s accusations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when she was a teenager.
At the hearing, she also witnessed Ford's accusations.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw Cavanaugh's brilliantness, quality and courage".
“The vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an exceptional record of public service,” he told many supporters in Western Virginia.
The President indirectly mentioned the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke of the importance of the election participants in the interim elections.
“Five weeks to one of the most important choices of our lives.
I'm really trying with my candidacy," he said.
“This is why I fight everywhere for excellent candidates.”
Trump claims that the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place at the latest on Friday, the CNN adviser of the Republican Party said.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds of people, the number of victims growing
On Saturday, authorities reported that in the earthquake and tsunami, which affected the Sulawesi island of Indonesia, at least 384 people died, a number of huge waves were carried out by the coast.
A hundred people gathered on Friday at the beach festival in Palu, when six meters of waves hit the coast and took many to death and destroyed everything on their way.
A tsunami was followed by a 7.5-degree earthquake.
"When the danger of tsunami occurred yesterday, people stayed on the beach and didn't get away immediately, so they became victims," said at the meeting in Jakarta the representative of the Indonesian agency for the mitigation of BNPB Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
“Cunami didn’t come alone, drew cars, trees, houses, everything went down,” he explained Nugroho and added that he traveled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before he hit the coast.
He said a few people climbed the trees to escape tsunami and survived.
Approximately 16.700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Paluo.
Photos from the air published by the accident agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and demolished bridges and mosses, surrounded by water.
The earthquakes continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, they felt a species of earthquakes.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in the statement that the energy released in a strong earthquake Friday was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in the second world war.
The geography of the city that lies at the end of the long and narrow bay is supposed to increase the size of tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims found captured under the ruins of buildings, and added, 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that victims and damage may be greater at the coast 300 km north of Palua, in the Donggal region, nearer to the earthquake epicenter.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely disconnected and they have no information from the Donggala area.
“In the area more than 300,000 people live”, said the Red Cross statement, adding that staff and volunteers are heading to affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse” they said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms because it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Pala, but officials say the waves came right at the time of issue warning.
On the amateur video published on social networks, a man on the top of the floor shouts on people on the street on the nearer tsunami.
In a few minutes, the water wall ran along the coast and took the buildings and cars with him.
With Reuters, the authenticity of the video was not possible.
The earthquakes and tsunami have resulted in an outbreak of electricity that has disconnected the communications around Paluo, which makes the authorities difficult to coordinate rescue actions.
The authorities report that the military began to send freight planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still need food and other basic living needs.
The local airport was only opened to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims in Indonesian tsunami increased to over 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebe, members of the World Vision organization from Dongala arrived safely in Pala, where employees in the courtyard set up a shelter from their laundry, but on the road saw a number of scenes of desolation.
“They have told me that they have seen many ruined houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster aid initiatives, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers with many experiences do not allow arrival in Pala.
In accordance with the Indonesian Regulations, cross-border funding, stocks and staff assistance shall only be authorised if the site of the accident is declared for the territory of the national accident.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still treated as an accident at the province level”, said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says “all right, this is a national disaster”, we can accept international aid, but it is not yet such a status.”
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palui, friends and relatives of the missing ones have hoped that their neighboring miracles are in sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who was captured two days under the ruins, and her mother's body was lying there.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian representation of the sailing padalism, trained two missing sailboats for the Asian Games, which ended in early this month in Indonesia.
Others, captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, were by the words of Mr. Mandagi's students.
“As an age in the field of sailing, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon remembers how the news about the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel was circulating through the community of sailmen, in despair he sent messages in the application of whatsApp to the competitors in Paluo, who attended the festival on the beach.
But his messages were only marked with one gray tick instead of two blues.
"I think this means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Tats stole 26.750 USD while charging aTMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
After the report from the Newport police, thieves stole 26.750 USD to the security service Brink’s, which filled the bankomat in Newport on the Leeve center.
The driver of the car was emptying the bankomat in the entertainment complex and preparing for the delivery of money, in a public statement by Detective Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, another man “come closer to the employee of the Brink’s security service from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Following the report, witnesses saw more suspects flee from the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
All who have information about the identity of the suspects should call the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changed his name to Ye
Raper Kanye West changed his name — to Ye.
The change was published on Saturday on Twitter and wrote: “Being with the official name of Canye West.”
The 41-year-old West has a nickname Ye for a while, and he also used it for the address of his eighth album issued by June.
The change comes just before his performance in the show Saturday Night Live, in which it is scheduled to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariano grande, who canceled the show for "personal reasons", said the maker of the show.
The word degrades his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning to him.
“I think “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means “you” (i.e. you),” West said at the beginning of this year when he spoke about the address of the album with the radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you and I am all of me.
Kanye, which means “the only”, has changed to Ye – this reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects everything we are."
Kanye is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed his desire for Love and Brother Love.
The former West co-worker, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with thought or without it and with large letters.
Mexican President AMLO promised not to use an army against civilians
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he would never use military forces against civilians, just as the country nears the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday on the Tlatelolco Plaza that “will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
At the time in Latin America, left-hand student movements began, at peaceful demonstrations on the market on 2 October 1968 soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador swore to support young Mexicans and students to provide monthly subsidies and to open more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education drag young people into criminal associations.
USA should double the financing of artificial intelligence
Since China is becoming more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the funds used for research in this area, the real investor and expert on artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments come after various parts of the US government predicted the use of artificial intelligence, even though the US has no official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in innovation in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The approximation of the Art Intelligence Research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are much for the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The double funding could double the possibility of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence to the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” (The Super Forces of Art Intelligence: China, Silicia Valley and New World Order) was published this month by the publishing house of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the president of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most visible companies for artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest ranked American player of the Othello game and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Googla.
Lee said that he was familiar with the previous technological competition of the American government, such as robotic competition organised by the DARPA Agency (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It is not China who takes over the best academics, but these are companies,” Lee explained.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have hired the best with universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that the doctors with artificial intelligence should automatically offer a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the artificial intelligence of the new generation.
The Chinese National Foundation for Nature Sciences finances people in academic institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organisations, distributing money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee explained.
At the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Centre for Art Intelligence, which combines partners from the industrial and academic sector, and the White House announced the establishment of a harsh board for artificial intelligence.
This month, however, the DARPA announced an investment in the AI initiative Next at the amount of two billion USDs.
National Scientific Foundation (NSF) in Art Intelligence Research currently invests more than 100 million USD per year
In the meantime, the American legislation, which wanted to create the National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has done nothing for months.
Macedonians decide to change the name of the state at the referendum
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in the referendum whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia" and would resolve decades of a long dispute with Greece, which opposed their application for membership in the European Union and Nat.
Greece, which has its province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and vetos its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, governments reached an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign voiced doubts that the participation would be at least 50 %, as long as it takes to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum list was: "Are you for membership in Nat and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO, for Macedonia, one of the countries that came up after the fall of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the youth in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the cover of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, Members of the Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote that will be decided.
The amendment of the name requires a two-third majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission has communicated that no irregularities have been reported until 13 hours.
However, the participation was only 16% compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters were awarded.
"I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018, issued their vows for a referendum in Macedonia on the change in the name of the country to open the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set hundreds before the tents set by those to boycott the referendum.
"We are for Nato and the EU, but we want to join with raised heads, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Euro-Aid integration."
The President of the Zaev Government says that membership in Nat will bring a strongly necessary investment in Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent unemployment rate.
"I believe that a large majority will be for because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his electoral license.
He added that a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
The poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday showed that the referendum would take part between 30 and 43 percent of the voters, which is less than the necessary electoral participation.
The second poll conducted by Macedonia's Television showed that 57% of the questions would be voted on Sunday.
Of these 70 percent would vote yes.
In order to succeed in the referendum, a 50% vote must be voted participant plus one vote.
An unsuccessful referendum would be the first serious impact on the Western government's policy, which took over the May's mandate.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has regained the entire Brighton defense and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense at the 2-0 Manchester City victories on Saturday.
The 65-minute hit of Aguer seemed ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentinean attacker took the passage in the middle of the playground.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He crossed one defense player and was faster than others on the edge of Brighton's criminal space.
Then he put Sterling on his left.
The English assailant returned with his first touch in criminal space the ball of Aguer, who beat Brighton's doorman Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguero deals with the problems in his legs," coach of the City of Pep Guardiole told reporters.
"We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he hit the goal at that time."
But Sterling was the one who gave blue blue boys the initial advantage of the first English league fight.
The goal reached the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero accepted the ball deep on Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball a few times and then sent the ball to Sterling against the remote door.
The blue blue attacker pushed the ball into the net just before we drove past naked.
On Tuesday at 12 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Aren stadium in Sinsheim, Germany in the group part of the League of Champions will meet with Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies and spoil their title options.
The Nationals team fell out of the finish line, so there's no special reason for a new attack.
But always the competition Scherzer hopes on Sunday that he can rise on the metal grill against the Colorado Rockies team. This will only happen if Rockies still have the chance to play in the finals, because the West League has the advantages of the Los Angeles Dodgers team.
Rockies won Friday 5:2 over the Nationals team provided the least invitation to the organisers, but they are still waiting for their first address in the division.
"Although we can't get anything, at least we can play in an excellent atmosphere before a big crowd here in Denver, and the opposite team will play at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have not yet published the names of the first metalman on Sunday, but in this case it will probably be metal Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal for the first 34th time, is a Thursday metal as a load player and would have had enough rest by Sunday.
Washington's right-wing player gathered this season 18 wins and 7 defeats with an average of 22,3 and 300 solutions with impacts in 220 2/3 change this season.
Trump at Meetings in West Virginia
The President indirectly touched the situation regarding his choice for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of the Republican electoral participation in the interim elections.
"All we have done will be at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I'm really working with my candidacy, so I fight everywhere for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “We have this terrible, terribly radical group of Democrats and this is happening now.
They are determined to take over the power again, using all possible means, you can see the insurrection, the wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat up to get power and control. It's what they want, power and control, but we won't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats are on the mission of "resistance and disruption".
“And you could see this in the last four days”, he said, and the Democrats described it as “anger, evil, low and liar”.
It specifically highlighted the member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, hearing a loud disobedience from the municipality.
“Remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, no, wait, this was really the bad speech of the body, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
Those who express their opinion are impatient.
When the activist of the Momentum organization in my local party said no doubt, it wasn't even a surprise.
Finally, I am the last in the form of parliamentary members from a laburist party who are not desirable because of the expression of our opinion.
My colleagues, Joan Ryan, happened similarly because she resisted antisemitism.
In my case, it was in the motion of unconfidentiality for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of the responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironicly similar questions Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In the notice of Friday, the meeting of the Labour Party Nottingham East said that “we want the meetings to be included and productive”.
In the eight years as far as I am a member of the local laburist party, Friday meetings were mostly exactly like this.
Today, the majority of meetings do not, unfortunately, use such a tone and the promise of a "friendly and gentle" policy has been forgotten for a long time if it ever started.
It is always more obvious that different views in the laboratory party are not available and it is judged in every opinion whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and the colleagues I thought earlier that we shared similar political views expected me to change my opinion and to take the views that I would never agree with – that this would be in the field of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it is not really important what I say – they follow criticism on social networks that call for non-election, they condemn the environment policy and tell me that he should not be in a lab party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I have better luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments that I am about are only political.
I admire the expertise and determination of those colleagues who face the flood of sexist or racist mourning, but do not let them be afraid.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how the rates of abuse have become something quite common.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the laburist party must promote the culture of patience.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions and with each proposal of the non-confidence or the amendment of the rules for the selection of the party is becoming more amazed.
In the last two years, I've received a lot of advice to put my head away and not to be so loud, but it will be "all right".
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since 32 years ago, as a student, I joined the laburist party – the reason for this was Tatcher’s government's negligence, which led the classroom to literally collapsed in my primary school – as a local councilor or government minister to try to take advantage of better public services for those who most need them.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the final elections.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political positions and areas that I did not agree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desires to waste time and energy to discuss my loyalty to the leader of the laborist party at the time when the country is flying against the brexit that will affect households, businesses and our public services.
But my true message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters and voters, regardless of whether they are members of a laburist party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threats after the inevitability or political fitness will prevent me from acting in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: unacceptable Ayr to the top of the ladder
Two known attempts have a little distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a victory in this wonderful entertainment championship game of the day.
Now they're at the top of the ladder and they're the only unsupervised team of tens.
In the end, the weight to the homepage was overlapped by their top defence and better exploitation of the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for pleasure.
“In our contests so far, we have been through many trials and we are still unattainable, so I must be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayra Team, the opportunity was taken better than us.”
The impact of Grant Anderson in the 14th minute turned by Frazier Climo, Ayr led into the lead, but the yellow chart for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, who received it in the game with Warriorsi, meant a number of advantages for Melrose and Jason Baggotttt cut the attempt without conversion.
Climo, at the time of the offence, increased the leadership for Ayr, before he hit half-time and then converted a single test for the 17:5 result for Ayr at the collision.
But Melrose began the second half very well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, turned by Baggot, reduced the lagby by five points.
It followed a long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which was carried on carriers, and afterwards, Ayr advanced with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow chart, and Melrose re-used the game with the player more with the unconverted attempt of Bruce Colvin at the end of the period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow chart because of Clima's invasion without a ball, MacPherson reached the attack.
Climo reached the points after Kyle Rowe shot David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry's wing player to the fifth attempt of hosts.
Player Still Game begins a new career in hosting
The Star of the Still Game Ford Kieran series is obviously submitted to the guestship, but it is supposed to become director of the licensed restaurant company.
56-year-old in the popular BBC series for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with a long-standing partner in comedians Greg Hemphill.
The two of them announced that after the next nineth season, Kiernan seems to be planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, Adriftmorn Limited is the director.
The player did not want to comment on the stories, but the source for Scottish Sun meant that Kiernan wanted to be involved in the "blowering guestship" in Glasgow.
“The seas are ours”: Bolivia, who has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Navy patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, naval blue flags are excreted.
Marine bases from Lake Titikaka to Amazon are covered by slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to regain it."
In the inland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in the bloody dispute due to the natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive — just as the longing for the rebound of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope may be the greatest after decades now, since Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the international court to receive after five years of consultation on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, a positive spirit expects a result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court's decision on large screens across the country and find that the court in The Hague will decide in favour of Bolivia, which claims that – after decades of non-resident talks – the Chile must negotiate access to Bolivia to the sovereign access to the sea.
Here's Morales, the Bolivian Carismatic Native President, who awaits the controversial battle for the reelection next year, also has great expectations on Monday's judgment.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favour of Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN authority established in the Netherlands has no authority to grant Bolivia Chilean territory and will not decide on the outcome of any conversations.
The fact that the decision of the international court comes only six months after listening to the final arguments means that the case was "not complex", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And for the last four years, they don't speak in front of Bolivia, but they may have a lot of cost.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea” said Zarate.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric drew all the goodwill from the Chilens, which may have remained, explained.
Discussions between Bolivia and Chile will continue at a certain point, but after that will be extremely difficult to participate in discussions.
The countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had suddenly taken a decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will bring a "excellent opportunity for a new period of relations with Chila" and the possibility of "finishing 139-year differences with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, used the maritime issue as a political opposition.
“Bolivia will never cancel its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to ignore the need to overcome the past.”
North Korea said that nuclear disarmment would not happen if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people would never first destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri had a speech on Saturday at the General Assembly of the United Nations.
The United States called on them to fulfill their promises made at the meeting between rival countries leaders in Singapore.
His statement comes at the time when the US Minister Mike Pompeo is clearly before the reset of nuclear diplomacy, which was at the dead point, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Reese says that the United States is wrong if they think that the continued sanctions and the contract of predictions of the end of the Korean North Korea war will be put on their knees.
Washington is cautious in accommodating the prediction without Pjongjang first taking decisive measures to disarm.
Kim and the US President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
However, the general doubt is that Pjongjang is serious about the firearms that the state sees as the only way to ensure his safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for Kim and Trump's second meeting.
At fashion magazines in Paris revealed the latest line of huge covers that came into trades with price accessible brands in your vicinity
If you want to complete your collection covering or completely hiding from the sun, you don't need to look forward.
Valentino and Thom Browne, in their collections for spring and summer 2019, revealed a collection of weird too many covers that blinded the style on the Paris Week of fashion.
Instagram was flooded by very impractical covers this summer, and the designer sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine’s cut, which was most out, was a hat in a egregious color with broad slopes decorated with feathers of similar accessories in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other too many fashion supplements included pebbles with expensive stones, magic hats and even pineapples — but your heads will not be heated.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter's masks than high fashions.
One creation was similar to airing equipment and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow the fashion, you're lucky.
Modern knowers predict that the giant covers will come to stores near you.
The wide hats are closely followed by La Bombie, a slammed hat with 60-centimeter shorts was observed in Rihanna and Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural brand for an exceptional non-practical hat, which overwhelmed the social networks, sent another large creation along the fashion runway — a slammed beach bag almost as large as the model in the bathtub she wore.
The raphia bag in a burnt orange colour, covered with raphia risks and white leather handles, was the central piece of La Riviera Collection designer Jacquemus for spring/year 2019 on the Paris Week of Mode.
The stylelist of the famous Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores for the next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial to global citizens
Scotland single schools enjoy the reputation of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the exams that are still strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other efforts of communities.
With more than 30,000 pupils throughout Scotland, this school represented by the Scottish Council for single schools (SCIS) aims to provide the highest level of service for their students and their parents.
Self-professional schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, the chosen vocational path and the city they hold as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a adapted school programme, we see that modern languages are still popular and a desired selection item in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language that he understands, the conversation is in his memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother's language, the words will come into his heart."
This is a good reminder that we must not rely solely on English when we want to establish relations and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that languages at the top of the scale are the highest levels of performance in single schools.
68 percent of students who learned foreign language have achieved an excellent assessment.
The data collected in 74 schools by the Scottish Council for single schools (SCIS) showed that 72 percent of pupils achieved an excellent assessment in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German pupils, 69 percent of French pupils and 63 percent of Spanish pupils.
This proves that single schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as a selective subject in the teaching plans of single schools and elsewhere as subjects in the fields of nature, technology, engineering and mathematics.
The study carried out in 2014 by the Commission on Employment and Training of the United Kingdom has shown that, for reasons why employers are tormented to fill free jobs, 17 percent can be attributed to the lack of language knowledge.
Therefore, the knowledge of languages becomes more urgent in preparing young people on their future vocational path.
With future employment opportunities that require language knowledge, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns another language, regardless of the vocational path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, there is a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can deal directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over competition.
The 2013 YouGov survey, covering more than 4000 adults in the United Kingdom, showed that 75 percent of people had not spoken foreign language well enough to talk, which was the only language spoken by the two-digit percentages of the questions, that is 15 percent.
Consequently, investing in language learning is important for children today.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have better opportunities to find proper employment.
In Scotland, schools differ from the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical contemporary languages, while others teach languages that are supposed to be the most important for the United Kingdom in 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be many languages taught by experts in this area in single schools.
Scotland single schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment to prepare and arm the knowledge needed for success, regardless of what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be viewed as "international communication skills".
Single schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish world of single schools
LeBron will debit Sunday in San Diego in Lakers' Dress
For fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first performance for the Los Angeles Lakers team, the waiting will be over soon.
The coach of Lakers, Luke Walton, announced that James will play in the Sunday's pre-season opening match against the Denver Nuggets team in San Diego.
But he doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
“More than one and less than 48”, explains Walton on the official Lakers team website.
The official Rapporteur of Lakers Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“In this stage of my career for preparation, I do not need a game before the season,” he said.
Trump's meeting in Western Virginia on YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling in West Virginia begins a series of conventions in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump's five planned meetings in the next week, including the stations in its favourite countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidate for a free seat in the Supreme Court is not yet confirmed, Trump wants to gain support for the coming intermediate elections, as the Republicans are threatening to lose control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia, and where on the Internet will it be possible to look at?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia will be on Saturday, 29 September 2018, at 19:00 A.M.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia can be viewed live online on YouTube channel.
Trump will probably talk about the hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh this week, who have become tense for sexual offence charges, which is why the senate confirmation was expected to be carried out by the FBI in one week.
However, the primary goal of this series of meetings is to help the Republicans awaiting important elections in November to gain a new start.
Therefore, in the campaign of President Trump, these five assemblys were intended to "promote volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.
“The oversight in the Congress is so important for its programme that the president will travel to as many countries as it may be," Reuters told a representative of Trump's campaign, who does not want to be appointed.
Today's meeting at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would attract interest in the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he received more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in public research.
“For Morrisey, it is a bad sign that the president has to come and raise it in public research”, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, following a report from Reuters.
Ryder's call 2018: US team still wants to win and maintain hope before Sunday's individual fights
After three unilateral games, the Saturday afternoon fights of two doubles (foursome) were perhaps what Ryder’s cup needed this year.
The slightest slope is a fantasy sports concept, but players truly believe it, especially in such competitions.
So where did the stud go now?
“They had six points of advantage, and now they have four, and this is probably a new start for us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage because it leads by four points and twelve more can get them.
But the Americans feel that the wind is in the sails, including the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each wins three points of four.
Spieth was destined from the beginning of a hit to a greenhouse and gives a good example.
The cries of luck continued to make it louder and resulted in a decisive blow when Thomas and I left with two points of equality in the fourth game.
The punch that brought them the victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, such as knowing that the American team still has the chances.
“You just have to look for your internal power and focus on your game,” said Spieth.
That's all those players have left now.
18 holes to glory.
The only player with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncontroversial story of Ryder's cupboard.
Unusual, but charming two Europeans have won four points of four and are unforgivable.
The two "Molliwood" were the only ones who didn't hit the bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs also avoided Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and a way in which apparently energy flows between them and the vomiting municipality confirms the fact that they are those players that will have to be defeated on Sunday, and no other player could have sealed the potential victorys of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets on Le Golf National.
At the same time, it's possible that both of us are in different holes.
But speaking of European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergia Garcia, the morning hero in a game with four balls, who was coupled with Alex Noren.
Because of the bugs and two double bugs in the first nine holes, the Spanish and Swedish fell into a crisis where they found no exit.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Games with four balls and two doubles are exceptionally interesting to follow from close to communication between couples, advice given to themselves, advice that they don't give themselves, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage before the last day, but the fights of two couples have shown that the US team also has a desire for victory, which some, in particular on the American side, doubt.
Europe leads 10:6 before the last day of Ryder's Cup
Europe goes on the last day of Ryder's pole with a good advantage after the Saturday game with four balls and two doubles leads with 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent couple made up by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, he made his best shot and with two victorys over Tiger Woods and Le Golf National on Le Golf National played out four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who strives to win the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, had in the morning games with four balls power over the American team that was wrong, and reported in a series of 3:1.
The US team fought better in two doubles, where two games won, but the remnant couldn't make it up.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual fights if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newspaper who won four consecutive points, while with Molinari (a couple called "Molliwood") after the sensational end of the week only the other couple who won four points in his first four games in Ryder's history.
After the victory of Woods and Patrick Reed in the game with four balls, they then appeared again, and even more convincingly defeated the spent Woods and the US newsman of Bryson Dechambeau at 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at moments, but lost 19 out of 29 games in a duel with four balls and two doubles, of which seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning games with four balls, returned for the duel of two pairs and coupled with Henrik Stanson by 2 and 1 defeated Dustin Johnson and Broox Koeopko, which were classified to the first and third place on the world scale.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest part of Paris, it didn't all go according to the plans of the team of Europe.
The three-time winners of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new criterion for the Americans on Saturday.
With two and one, they were determined to win against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the game with four balls and returned later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fights of two doubles, losing the first two holes.
Only once in Ryder's history, the team returned after the four points behind each fight, even though Furyk's team only needs an equipment to preserve the trophy.
But after two days in second place, a weekly counterattack may seem too much to eat.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will never disarm ourselves unilaterally”
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister announced to the United Nations that the further implementation of sanctions is increasingly inconfident in the United States of America and that Northern Korea will certainly not unilaterally cancel its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of the World Authority, Ri Jong Ho said that in the past year, North Korea has taken numerous "important measures in favour of goodwill", such as stopping the implementation of nuclear and missile experiments, the sites for nuclear experiments and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"But we do not see the proper US response," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we will not be convinced of national security and under these conditions, we will never be the one-sided first to disarm."
While Ri repeated the known complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to the gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in the context of which North Korea would be awarded for the adoption of gradual measures, its statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pjongjang did in the past.
The Ri was committed to the joint statement of Kim Johng Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on June 12th. At that time Kim committed to strive for "nuclear disarmment of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump North Korea promised security.
North Korea wants the official conclusion of the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States said Pjongjang must first cancel the nuclear weapon.
Washington has also not responded to calls to release strict international sanctions applicable to North Korea.
"The US insist that we first need to disarm nuclear weapons, and they step pressures with sanctions in order to achieve their goals by force, and even object to declaring the end of the war," Ri reported.
“With thinking that sanctions could put us on our knees, it is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t even know us.
However, the problem is that further implementation of sanctions continues to deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kima and Trump, which the US President highlighted at the United Nations Assembly at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kima and South Korean President Mun Je In, who have turned away in the past five months, and added: "If the problems of nuclear disarmament would be discussed with South Korea and not the US, the nuclear disarmment of the Korean Peninsula would not agree to such a dead point."
However, the tone of the Rijeka speech was completely different from that last year when the General Assembly of the United Nations said that the attack on the inland part of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump Kima marked as a “racket man” on the suicide mission.
This year Trump, who threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, commended Kim and his courage to take the measures for disarmment last year, but said that there is much more work to do and that sanctions must remain valid until North Korea is nuclearly disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said that there is no scheduled timeframe for this, and said: “Tradition can take two years, three years or five months – it does not matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the measures taken.
However, on Thursday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council: “The exercise of the sanctions of the Security Council must be determined to continue without exception until we recognize the complete, complete and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions for North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korean nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rijeh at the edge of the United Nations General Assembly and later said that Pjongjang will again visit the next month for preparations at the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pjongjang in July, he declared that there was progress, and North Korea criticised him in a few hours that his demands were "gangster".
North Korea pledged to support the missile testing station and nuclear infrastructure at the meeting with Muna, which took place in this month.
The Mun was supposed to tell Kim that with "exercise measures" there were considerable security assurances that Trump promised in Singapore, and measures to normalise relations with Washington.
University students attend a course to learn how to take enough time to rest
The aim of the new course this year at Harvard University is to teach all graduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight the growing cat culture of "intellectual" learning in which power is collected with caffeine.
The university professor found that students of the world's best universities often do not know the basics of concern for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a medical professor of sleep at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist in Brigham's Women's Hospital, has formed a course that, according to his first kind in the United States.
In order to carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of the lack of sleep on learning.
After the end of the lecture, the girl approached him and said: “Why do I find this just now that I'm in the last year?”
She said no one's ever told her how important the sleeper is, and the The Daily Telegraph magazine told the professor that it surprised him.
This year's first course speaks of the key importance of good sleeping habits for study and sports success as well as to improve the general good feeling.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatrics at Harvard Medical School and the CEO of the University's health services, says they have decided to make such a course when they have found that students are significantly lacking sleep during the week.
The enormous course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door of the student home where students can click coffee cups, curtains, sports copates and books to obtain information about the influence of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep shortages on sports success and the importance of sleeping routine.
In the second section, however, participants find that long-term sleep deficiency can increase the risk of cardiac arrest, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons of the participants encourages the thinking of their daily routine.
"We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how smoking cigarettes affect their health," added Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of pride is still present with the “surviving full-night learning”. It also adds that modern technology and growing pressure on students, which is the result of lack of sleep, are growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that the sufficient amount of quality sleep should be "secret weapons" students to fight stress, exhaustion and concern. It can also avoid gaining weight – the brains are switched to a way of hunger due to lack of sleep, which makes students constantly hungry.
19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler develop a course last year, attending one professor's lecture during the first year in Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct the course throughout the student population.
He hopes that at the next stage of the under-the-spot students will be able to ask them to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to set up a sleep alarm as well as to wake up. He also wants to warn them about the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights because they can cause the ritm of circadia, which makes it difficult to sleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit pounded up the ups of Gerrard's teams
Rangers defeated again in guests: Dolly Menga in Livingstone declared Steven Gerrard's team to defeat by 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team hunted its first roaming victory after February's override at St. Johnstone Stadium with 4 : 1, but the team of Gary Holt gave her the second defeat in 18 matches since Gerrard headed by his team for the leading team of the Scottish League.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the first half, and the chosen Rangers didn't give the impression that he wanted to balance.
With this, Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston advanced to the third place, but the difference between the goals was the Hibernian team.
Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when he reportedly flew the subject from the city of the guest team.
Gerrard, in a crew, who defeated Ayr without any trouble, and turned into the semifinals of Bethfred Cup, made eight changes.
On the other hand, Holt held the verified eleven of Livingston, who took away the point of the Hearts team a week before that, and he was certainly enthusiastic about how his depleted team effectively neutralized all the attempts of the guests.
Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start, when Menga was briefly handed out by Scott Pittman, he then went to the goal of Allan McGregor, but the connectionist was inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs then reached Captain Craig Halkett, but then his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow couldn't put him in the goal.
In the last third, Rangers took over control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire for victory.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after the race with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the game, a criminal shot should be awarded, but Judge Steven Thomson's demand of the Colombian fell into the pot.
Rangers were able to compose only two shots at the goal in the first half, but not a head shot sent against Lassan Coulibaly, nor the young ball of Ovie Ejari, were no danger for the doorman Liam Kelly.
Livingstone’s opening goal in the 34th minute may have been amazed by everything, but he was due to perseverance.
Rangers failed to cash another Jacobs extension with a long pass.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher put the ball up to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi a pass for a simple ending of the attack.
Gerrard acted and replaced Coulibaly during his vacation with wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately proved to be handing over Morelos, but Kelly effectively drove off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, while Lithgow and Halkett took care of several times before the goal.
Holt's team could still increase the leadership against the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate after the submission from the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the chance of a crime shooting after his contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson didn't recognize him.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
We present a page from the almanah of our weekly editions: September 30, 1882, so today over 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm was born in Germany “Hans” Geiger, who later became a world-famous physicist.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called Geiger's number.
In the science world, he became a resident, and he also got his city in pop culture, say in the 1950s movie "Bells of Coronado", where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played a cowboy scientist:
Men: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s number. It is used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that has on atoms radioactivity in materials."
Evans: “Madonnas, but now they're really advocating!”
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before 63th birthday.
And the invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to identify attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to identify attack cells and destroy them
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to identify attack cells
This method includes obtaining immune cells of patients who are subsequently modified in the laboratory
After this, the protein that is characterised by many forms of cancer may be returned to the patient.
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify the attack cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method includes obtaining immune cells of patients who change them into a laboratory to “see” the HER2 protein that is characterised for many forms of cancer and then inject again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Institute for Cancer Research in Bethesda in Maryland said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Her2 “promotes growth of several different types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and fat intestines.
A similar approach to obtaining immune cells of patients who were “teached” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of the type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, after performing at the SNL, performed a thrump point with the MAGA inscription on the drop.
The Municipality Was Not Excited
Kanye West was whispered in the studio by Saturday Night Live at a strange point, which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that he would move 2020 for the presidential chair.
After the end of the performance with the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", where he wore his hat with the “Make America Great Again”, West began attacking the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens to me to talk to a whitepolous person and tells me, “How can you like Trump, because he is a racist?”
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,”the right.
This time the SNL broadcast began with a paradoia with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood player went out of his way from the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh to the Senate Justice Commission, accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but it was placed in social networks by the comic book of Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make fun of it from West.
West also complained to the congregation that he had some difficulty writing on the drop.
“They came after the stage for me.
They said, "Don't go on the stage with that hat."
I've been harassed!
But they say I'm lost," he said after the report from Washington Examiner.
West continued: “You want to see the lost scene?” and added that he must find the “Superman’s cap because it means no one can command me. You want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments were prepared by the municipality at least twice to whistle, and the members of the SNL team were in apparent distraction, and someone also said about Vanity: “In the studio there was death silence.”
At the last moment west was invited to replace Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Raper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
The West has already caused a lot of wonders with a video song “I Love It”, where he wore a bottle of mineral water brand Perrier.
West supported Candace Turner, leader of the TPUSA conservative group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for UPRL RAJI.”
However, the head of the conversation show Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “what it is, and that's just fine.
However, I will not reward someone (with the purchase of his music, clothing or supporting his “artitude”), who, in my opinion, welcomes and expands the ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And we," she added.
Before the show, a rapper posted on Twitter that he changed his name and will now be “being, formally known as Kanye West. Now I am YE.”
He's not the first musician who decided to change his name before Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His resident colleague Snoop Dogg once named Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, then was an artist, once known as Prince.

KIT HARINGTON'S STRONG FACT OF toxic men
Kit Harrington is known for his stirring swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-coloured fantasy series Game of thrones.
31-year-old player, who sharply condemned the stereotype of the machete hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on the screen, young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with hardliness.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that something went wrong in his opinion and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxicity during the movement #JazTudi.
A player who recently married a 31-year-old teammate from the Game of the thrones of Rose Leslie admitted that he has strong beliefs about this subject.
“I am currently seriously wondering where we made a mistake when there is a man,” he said.
“What have we taught men about the problems we now face during our growing up?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic humanity due to displaying very male characters.
He continued: “What is born, and what is learned?
What are they teaching us on television and on the streets that young boys feel that they have to choose a very specific paycheck of men?
I think it's one of the important questions of our time, how can we change that?
Because apparently something went wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the show the next summer he would not participate in recording any prejuvention or continuation of the Game of thrones because he “locked it with battlefields and horses”.
In November, Kit will play the role of a new performance of True West Sam Shepard, a story about the film producer and his brother the thief.
The player recently discovered that the best thing that happened because of the Game of thrones was that he met his wife Rose on the recording.
“For this series I met my wife, so she somehow gave me my future family and life from here forward,” he said.
Rose was in a fantasy show, awarded with Emmy, played Ygritte, the love choice of Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple was married in June 2018 in the possession of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/aids: Chinese reports of 14% increases in new cases
China announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the large majority of new cases, the disease was passed with sexual relations, which represents a change compared to the past.
In some parts of China, HIV was usually rapidly spread due to blood-infected transfusion.
However, according to data from Chinese health officials from the conference in Junan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in such a way has decreased to almost nothing.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China continues to increase by 100,000 people annually.
Transfer of HIV with sexual relations is a very serious problem in the Chinese community of LGBT.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination from the LGBT community remains very present.
Since conservative values still apply in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men are eventually married to a woman afterwards.
The disease is often tolerated due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a general access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff has issued data on the Republican senators, condemns "risk lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, the American congresswotter Maxine Waters rejected the accusations that a member of her staff published information on three US Republican senators on their website in Wikipeda.
A Democrat from Los Angeles claimed that these accusations are coming from individuals and websites of the extreme right.
"Lies, lies and more inadmissible lies," Waters wrote in a statement in Twitter.
The published information is included in the home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch from the Utah State.
These data appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during the session of the Senate on the charges of the sexual liability of the candidate for the Supreme Judge, Brett Canaugh.
The leak came after the three senators finished hearing Kavanaugh.
The conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicate that it is possible to identify the source of the publication that is intended to be linked to Senator Waters' office and to conclude that the information has been published by one of the staff is still reported by Hill.
“These unfounded accusations are completely wrong and pure lies” continues Waters.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are endangered because of these false accusations, are not at all responsible for entering these data.
These unfounded accusations are completely unrealistic and pure lies."
The statement by Senator Watersov quickly came across criticism on the Internet, including the former representative of the White House for Press, Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial of anger”, Fleischer wrote.
"This can mean it's not from the right test for the congress.
When you accuse someone of something he didn't do, he can't show anger.
He can't fight.
And he can't doubt the motive of whoever accused him.
It must remain calm."
Fleischer compared the response of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate, who runs for the city of Waters at the mid-election elections, has reached Twitter.
“If that is true, it is serious”, he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her cabinet informed "the relevant institutions and bodies of prosecution regarding these false accusations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators will be disclosed”, she continued, “and that they will be responsible for all the actions that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and all of them.”
Johnny English again in action - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
Searching for clues to Brexit in any new British film has become traditional, and also applies to the revival of Johnny English's action comedy, who first arrived on the cover in 2003 with the title Johnny English and continued in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Is the fun satire about how bad we are, the new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English, with his awake eyes and unusual grimas, receives permission to mix the puppies again; his name already indicates that it is a comic character created for a cinema audience in the non-English speaking areas.
It is an awkward secret agent, who, despite his bizarre moves, contains part of Clouseau, the ninth of Mr Bean and the minority of the one who contributed to the last note of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mystery that Atkinson once played in the now forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving behind the real chaos.
The latest film presents one or two pleasant moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, he wore a medieval armor, and the rotor's lists were on his helmet for a while.
Atkinson’s comedy gift is clearly shown, but humor seems slightly mild and excessively unnecessary, especially because "real" films such as 007 or the mission are impossible now without bad news offer comic elements.
It looks like humor is intended for children and not so much adult viewers, and so for me, Johnny English's events are not as innovative and directed as Atkinson's neme jumps in Mr. Bean's role.
The constant theme is now evident that Britain is in serious trouble.
The internet hacker has been infiltrated into the web network of British most secret agents and has revealed the identity of all British agents, causing great problems to a decent agent who is in a surprisingly small role represented by Kevin Eldon.
This is the point of fracture for the premiere, a pompous figure that has already experienced a fracture because of political discontent: Emma Thompson has otherwise tried to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing in the scenario that can help herself.
Intelligence shall inform her that all active spys are disclosed, so it must decide on one of the retired spys.
And this means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prominent school who informs you about how to work under cover: there are screenwriters struck because English performs some sort of spy rock 'cademy'.
They're taking English to Whitehall at an emergency meeting, where he meets the long-term coworker Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander, a stereotype sports enthusiast, a role that Vicki Pepperdine is just losing.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create more problems on behalf of the secret service of her Majesty, and they meet Fatalko Ophelio Bullet, who is played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the interim time, the premier is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic technology billionaire, who claims that he can solve the computer problems of Britain: this is the evil Jason Walt played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their Odyssead: dressed in waiters inflicted fire in the French restaurant, create chaos when they overthrow on the roof of Walt's yacht, and when English attempts to use glasses for seeming reality to meet the inside of Walt's house, it manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathetic and energeticness, it reminds children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English movies, I can't help myself here and think, is the British film Atkinson capable of giving a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labourists deny that the British are planning a four-day working week, receiving a payment for a five-day working week.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and receive a payment in five days.
The party of business leaders wants the savings created by companies due to the revolution of artificial intelligence to move to workers and allow them an additional day off.
That way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend at the same high salary.
Sources say the idea corresponds to the economic plan of the party and plans to put the country on the side of the workers.
The unions support the transition to a four-day working week, as this is the way for workers to take advantage of the benefits of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party stated to The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is supposed to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but the four-week worker is the goal we will endeavour to achieve by approaching the party to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the general industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourist Party would not be the first to support such an idea as the Four-week Work Week in its campaign in the general elections in 2017 supported the Green Party.
This objective is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The representative of the Labourist Party said: “The four-day work week is no party policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
The Chancellor in the shadow John McDonnell used the lab conference last week to present his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take out the power of “responsive directors” and“profits” in municipal companies.
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current participants in the plumbing companies may not regain a full share, as the laborist party could introduce "deductions" on the basis of alleged blames.
He also confirmed plans for the inclusion of workers in administrative committees and the introduction of Privatisation Funds, allowing 10% of the share in private companies to be transferred to employees who would receive annual dividends up to 500 GBPs.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, in the show "60 minutes" ("60 minutes") discussed whether their opinion could change the investigation of Kavanaugh, carried out by the FBI.
The investigation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, conducted by the FBI, has launched a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week and raises a question whether the findings of any Republican senator's office could be convinced that he would withdraw his support to the judge.
In an interview that was delivered on Sunday, the correspondent submitted the "60 minutes" of the Republican senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI could find out anything that would change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than a colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, unlimited, uneven."
And Graham's voice seems to be carved in a stone.
“I created my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely convincing reason for his change,” he said.
“ I don't know what happened to Dr. Fords, but I know the following: Brett denies it decisively,” added Graham, mentioning Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those she named
The case is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, a annual music event involving a truly remarkable type of stars and which has the same extraordinary mission: to eliminate poverty in the world.
The festival, which will take place this week, will be attended by the tenths of people. They will be occupied with the Great Tratto of the Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to induce interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The global citizen festival, which started in 2012, is the extension of the Global Citizens Project, the International Advocate Group, which hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (except if you were willing to pay for the VIP ticket), concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful way to increase awareness of their goal of eliminating poverty.
How successful is the movement of the Global Citizen, which is left to achieve its goal for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to require action, or is this just another example of such called "clictivism" – creating belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation with the signing of a online petition or the Twitter mediation?
The movement of the Global Citizen states that more than 19 million of its supporters should be recorded in the 2011 effort for a variety of different objectives.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to adopt commitments and policies worth more than 37 billion USD, which should affect lives more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the early 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions was 390 commitments and communications on the basis of which at least 10 billion USD were already paid or collected.
The group estimates that funds have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments are the Power of Nutrition (The Power of Nutrition), the partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to helping "children to achieve their full potential" which the Ruands promised 35 million USD aid to help eliminate feedback after receiving more than 4700 tweets of movement Global citizens.
“With the support of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and global citizens, such as you, we can correct the social guilt of feeding into historical archives”, said Tracey Ullman, ambassador of the Power Food Partnership at the concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 acts carried out by the United Kingdom were called on to improve mother and child nutrition, the government said that it would co-financing the food power project that would achieve 5 million women and children by nutrition measures.
In response to one of the common questions on the website, "Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?"
The global citizen replied: “This will be a long and hard way – sometimes we will fall down and fail.
But as well as the great movement for civil rights and the fight against the apartmentheid against us, we will also succeed because together we are stronger.
Among some performers performing this year in New York are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe. The event will be directed by Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
United States could use the Navy to "blocado" Russian exports – the US Internal Ministry
The US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said, following the report by Washington Examiner, that Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be warned that it is an excuse for exploring new energy markets to be invited to the lawful government).
“I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as it is marketed in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
According to the functionary, however, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can handle this. The Navy shall ensure that our maritime routes are open and block them, where necessary, preventing Russian energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event hosted by the Energy Consumer Union, a non-profit group, which is entitled as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was actually the same.
"As regards Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less fuel impact and their replacement," he said, marking Russia as a "pony that knows one trick" with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at the time when Trump's administration seeks to increase the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, where it is intended to undermine Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, the official of Trump's government, including the President of the United States, Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to give up the "unappropriate" gas pipeline project North Stream 2, which is supposed to be "talent" of Moscow on Trump Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion USD, which is intended to double existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that it is an unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we have the same position that energy must not be a tool for the implementation of pressure and that consumers must have the right to choose suppliers," Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said after September's meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the American position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German Industrial Organisation, the Union of German Industries (BDI), urged the US not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“The third country's involvement in our energy supply means a big problem for me”, following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angelo Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Union (BDI).
Elizabeth Warren will "exactly study" her candidacy in the elections for the American President in 2020, says the Massachusett senator
The Massachusett Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "exactly study" her candidacy for the US president after the mid-term elections.
In the city house in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider her candidacy.
“It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman's leader,” she said after reporting officer The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will examine my candidacy for the president precisely."
Warren built President Donald Trump at a meeting in the city house because he was supposed to lead this country in the wrong direction.
“What Donald Trump does to our democracy, I am terribly worried about," she said.
Warren has criticised Trumpa and the candidate for the president of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh several times sincerely.
In the tweet published on Friday, Warren said: “Of course, before the elections, we need an FBI investigation.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that most of its own voters believe that Warren should not move for the position of the President in 2020.
According to the Politics Research Centre of the University in Suffolko/Time Boston Globe, the senator should not be running for president, eighty-five percent of the "probable" voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick has greater support for his bid, with 38 percent of the polls to support it, and 48 percent are expected to oppose it.
Other senior Democrats who would come into office for the elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
After the report, Associated Press said that he would make a formal decision until January.
Sarah Palin mentioned post-traumatic stress disturbance for Track Palina at the meeting in support of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his entry into the army.
On Monday night he was arrested and accused of family violence
“If my own son, what he experiences after return, is connected to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain measure of injuries with which our soldiers are returned,” he told the municipality at the meeting in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin's son's arrest was marked as “slon in the salon” and said that her son and other war veterans were returned slightly changed, found out, questioning where respect for what the troops and the airmen and all the other military members were offering to the state.”
Tracka Palina was arrested on Monday in Wasilla in Alaska and accused by violence in the family by attacking a woman, impeaching violence in the family and possession of a vineyard, said Dan Bennett, representative of the police station in Wasilla.
18 federal countries and the District of Colombia support the abolition of new asylum policy
Eighteen federal countries and the District of Colombia support the legal denial of the new American policy, fleeing against the violence of gangs or violence in the family, to deny asylum rights.
The NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the area mentioned on Friday filled a court lobby in order to support the legal opposition of the policy.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's action against the Sessions, which the US Liaison for Civil Liberties against Federal Policy has not been published.
She said that her partner and "his violent sons, members of the gang" abused her, but the American authorities rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
The State Prosecutors of the Federal Countries supporting Grace are Salvador, Honduras and Guatemall, from whom a number of asylum applications come in the United States, described as states that constantly cope with the problems with the gangs and violence in the family.
In 2014, the new Asylum Policy of the United States has revoked the decision of the Committee on Immigrant Calls, which is unreported to immigrants fled from violence in the family, allowing the application for asylum.
In a statement Friday, the U.S. Prosecutor of the District of Columbia, General Karl Racine, said that the new policy "representes decades of state, federal and international law".
“The federal law requires that all asylum requirements be assessed on the basis of individual facts and circumstances of the application and that such a prohibition violates this principle”, states the request submitted to the court.
In the request, the Prosecutors further stated that the policy that denies immigrants' right to enter harms the US economy, as these are likely to become entrepreneurs and are “providing the necessary workforce”.
The General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions has ordered the immigration judges to no longer grant asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and violence by gangs.
“Azil is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in a single social group or political opinion”, Sessions said on 11 June in his publication of politics.
Azil was never meant to resolve all the problems, even serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Paluo doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are taking place to find survivors
The situation was getting worse for the survivors.
“The feeling is very tense”, said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusum when she comforted her hot boyfriend in the evacuation center in the divided city of Palu.
“Saviors bring bodies all the time.
It lacks clean water."
It seems to have been locals, returning to ruined homes who have been striking through overwhelmed things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people and hospitals destroyed by the earthquake of Grade 7.5 were overloaded.
Some injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injury, were rested outside the military hospital in Paluo, where patients were treated on the loose due to continuously severe earthquake suns.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that struck the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was living with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled his tears.
"There was no time to get rid of it.
I think it squeezed me against the ruins of the wall," Harris told the agency Associated Press. He added that he was with his family in town for the wedding.
“I heard a woman who called for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China's "advancement" with "propagand ads"
One week after the publication of the four-party official Chinese newspaper in the American journal, which praised the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China Beijing accused the abuses of American propaganda press.
The US President Donald Trump last week mentioned the paid addition of the Chinese Daily officer in the Des Moines register – the most sold newspaper in the Iowa State, after he accused China of interference in the US conventional elections on 6 November, which China denied.
The Reuters reported that the U.S. Federal Officers were Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with US federal elections, described as a new phase in increasing Washington effort to press China.
While foreign governments have a common commercial promotion announcement, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an increasingly intense trade war in which they exchange impacts by introducing customs to import products.
Chinese refund tariffs in the beginning of the trade war were intended to affect exporters in federal countries such as Iowa, supporting Trump's Republican Party, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador in China and former long-term Governor Iowe, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said that Beijing has affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in the column in the weekly issue of Officer Des Moines Register, “let this harassment double by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press”.
“In the expansion of propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the valued American tradition of free speech and the free press for the publication of a paid ad in the Des Moines Registration officer”, Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see only a few other opinions in Beijing and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions that Chinese citizens have on the worrying Chinese economic route, since the public is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused the publication offer” of his article, even though he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose voters before mid-elections with the break with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and advocate candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, despite more sexual assault charges, will be known in the coming interim elections with the loss of voters.
The emotions are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue with the vote.
Grant Reeher, professor of politics at Maxwell University of Syracuse for an article published on Saturday in Officer The Hill, said this.
Reeher said he suspected Senator Jeff Flake's pressure to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to calm down angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow and not even November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn on Friday after the report by Officer Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November!” when they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate, when the Republicans who oversee the judicial committee decided to further support Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the news portal Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will exceed all borders," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told reporters.
“People say they are already strong, and they hold it.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undefined voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 years, who do not like the president, but do not vote often."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, describing her accusations on the sexual assault of the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts said that further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a major confusion for the GOP”, said Michael Steele, former President of the Republican National Council, following the report from the NBC News.
"It is not only the vote of the world or the final vote or the Cavanaugh's oath; it is also a way that the Republicans deal with this and how they dealt with Fordovo," Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities Group, who supports Democrats at the elections.
However, the Americans seem to be slightly divided between whether to believe in the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a little more supportive of the next one.
The new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of the polls are definitely or most likely to be witnessed by Ford, and 35 percent said that they are definitely or most trusting Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh believed that, during the trial, likely or certainly lied about Forda, only 30 percent of them said.
After the pressure of Flake FBA, the FBA is currently investigating the charges submitted by Fordov, and at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, was reported by Officer The Guardian.
Last week, Ford, before the Senate's Judgment Council, witnessed that Kavanaugh, when she was 17 years old, attacked her in a wine state.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her gender when they were together at the party during their Yale University study in 1980.
World Web inventor intends to start a new Internet to deal with Google and Facebook
The Berners-Lee team, the inventor of the world's web, opens a start-up company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Googlu.
The last project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners' open-end platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data are stored and who has access to any information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee was joking that the purpose of the Inrupt is to "prevail the world".
“We decided to do this now”, he said about a new company.
"It's for a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid Platform technology that allows users to create a "personal storage warehouse for data" or POD
This may contain information on contacts, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser and at the same time.
The specificity of the personal storage storage warehouse is that the user can fully determine who can access any information.
The company calls this "personal data recovery".
The Executive Director John Bruce says that the idea of the company is to combine resources, processes and appropriate skills that will enable everyone to access the Solid Platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some of the hired developers for work on the project and the community of volunteers.
With this week, technology developers around the world using tools available on the Inrupt website could create their own decentralised applications.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group “with Facebook and Google do not discuss whether they could introduce a complete change that could dissolve all their business models overnight.”
"We don't ask for permission."
In a Saturday post on the Medium portal, Berners-Lee wrote that the intention of Inrupt "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid Platform".
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee was a powerful voice in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Berners-Lee will also remain a founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute Institute Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic, ” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Victoria's 1st World War Client Festival
In the hometown for 100 years they have celebrated the award of Victoria’s cross to the only priest of the English church he acquired as a fighter in the first world war.
The honorable lieutenant Bernard Vann earned his confession on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sharpshooter, so he never knew that he was granted this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two colonel's grandchildren discovered a memorial stone.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the grandpa's act that he earned the decoration.
After the report by Officer London Gazette, Colonel Vann on September 29, 1918 led his battalion via the Canal of St. Queen “with a very dense fog and under a strong fire of battlefield and machinery”.
Later, he planned against the firing line and led the line with “the greatest heroism” onwards, and then I attacked the machinery myself and hit three members of the squad.
On 4 October 2018, only a good month before the end of the war, Colonel Vanna shot a German sharpshooter.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of an old father were “something that I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility. ”
With the brother, Dr. James Vann, the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band also laid the wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt "very honored to be able to participate in this parade" and "the courage of a true hero reflects in the support that many people will pronounce."
The enthusiasts of mixed fighting skills were lying all night to watch Bellator 206 instead were shared with Puysse Pepe.
Imagine: You've been lying all night to watch the completely sold Bellator 206, then you can't see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main park, and was carried live in the United Kingdom on the 5th channel.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront themselves, the viewers in the United Kingdom amazed that the transfer was replaced by the play of Pujs Pep.
Marcixdo was not very impressed, because he stayed awake until morning due to the fight.
One of the enthusiasts on Twitter described the switch to the child's drawing as “some sort of a painful joke”.
“In accordance with the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6:00 in the morning, so they had to switch to the baby program”, said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of the Bellator Marketing and Communication organization, when they asked him about the transfer.
"Puce Pep. " Yes."
The President of the Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule to include viewers in the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about re-showing, I think we can handle this”, Coker said.
"But then there is the sixth hour in the morning and we will not be able to arrange this until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, a number of messages were exchanged in the switch and not everyone was kind.
We were trying to sort this out; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the actual reason was the government regulation.
I can promise you that this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will tolerate five fights — as usual. We have tried to offer more than expectations to the fans, and we have counted on it.
This is a very ungrateful situation."
It was the first time in his life, and it was the first time in his life, and it was the first time in his life, and it was the first time in his life.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley said that because of his sexual orientation, he felt less valuable than anyone — but it gave him motivation for success.
The 24-year-old said that not everyone like him was aware when he entered high school.
In the first show of Dessert Island Discs, which was directed by Lauren Laverne for radio station 4, he said that he spoke about gay rights to give others “relief”.
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was reduced.
The regular leader of the long-term broadcast, Kirsty Young, was absent due to a multi-month disease.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast in Laverne's first show, said that he felt "lessly valuable" than everyone else, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to have boys and girls".
He said: “To date, these feelings of minority and differentity are a real thing that gives me strength and perseverance to achieve success. ”
He wanted to prove that he was “something”, he said that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally learn about his orientation.
Two times the bronze Olympic competitor became an influential advocate of the LGBT rights and appeared on the Games of Nation Communitys in Australia twice this year to invite countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had spoken because he felt happy that he could openly speak without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “relief. ”
The three-time World Championship said that the romance with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013, was "prestopped".
Daley and the Oscar winner, who was 20 years old, reported last year, but said the difference in years never meant trouble.
“When you are so young ” – in the age of 14, the first Olympic games were attended, and three years later his father died — he said, it is hard to find someone the same age that would experience similar rises and falls.
A couple of June adopted a child, a son of Robert Ray Blacka-Daley, and Daley says that it changed his "full view".
“If they asked me last year, all I had to say was that “I must reach the gold medal”, he said.
"But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
The son wears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 in the age of 40 because of brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you won't be in the first row, Dad," he said.
“I held him for my hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead, I finally had to admit that he was not vulnerable,” he said.
The next year Daley was in the Olympics in 2012 and reached a bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I dreamed of all my life – dive in the Olympics before the home municipality. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first selection of songs – the Poud of the musician Heather Small, which was accompanied by preparations for the Olympic Games and which is still narrowing his skin.
The Desert Island Discs broadcast at BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
The unprepared Mickelson preceded the Saturday Ryder Cup
The American Phil Mickelson will play his 47th game in Ryder's show, set a record, but he'll have to go back to form again so that it won't become an unhappy frontier.
Mickelsson, who has been involved in the biennial event for the record 12th time, left Captain Furyk sitting at the Saturday four.
Instead of being in the center of the event, as it was often for the United States, the five-fold winner spent the day working as a fan and part in improving his game to fix what he was trying to do.
Given that even at the peak of the career, the 48-year-old did not fit the narrowest Le Golf National playground, where the long ice inevitably punishes the misfortune.
And if only the playground wouldn't be scary enough, Mickelson would have dealt with the right winner of the British Open Francescom Molinari, who jumped to victory in all four games this week with Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who have four matches at the beginning of the 12 games of individuals, were to start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, otherwise he didn't say much.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he struck my back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” said Furyk.
“There is a lot of trust in the village.
He is one of the celebrities and is in the past, and he also contributed extremely to the teams this week.
I guess I never imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it worked out like that, and we thought we had to do that.
He wants to play like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the largest number of matches played in the Ryder Cup Cup Cup.
This could mark the conclusion of Ryder's career, which never really matched his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven equations, but Furyk said that his presence in the team also involves some unacceptable benefits.
“He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make a fool out of people and it's wonderful to have it in a team space” he explained.
“I think younger players had fun when they moved with him this week, which was fun to see.”
It gives much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon be gained
Thomas Bjorn, a European captain, from experience, knows that the important advantage at the beginning of the last day of the game of individuals in Ryder's concert could easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
In 1997, the young Danec debited at the Valderrama game, where the page whose captain was Seve Ballesteros had five points of advantage before the Americans, and through the goal, she gained advantage only for the hair, with a result of 141.2-131.2.
“Don't forget that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but barely” said Bjorn (in image) following a view of the Class of 2018 team that won 5-3 in Friday and yesterday and spoke at Le Golf National at the LeGolf National field with 10-6.
So history to me and everyone on the team shows that the poople isn't over yet.
Play the full game tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you need to do.
The game's not over until it's on the board.
We have a goal to win this bargain, and we need to stay focused on it.
All the time he says that I focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know well who stands on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn added: “I would never get there.
Tomorrow's gonna be a different day.
Tomorrow's the game of individuals, so this will have to be done differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things go well when you're there alone, your golfers' abilities are tested to the end.
This is a message you need to deliver to the players: Tomorrow you must extract the best from you.
Now leave your partner behind and he must draw out the best."
Contrary to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who reached three points of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the transformation in the last day, because in Brookline he was part of the winning team before he ended as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word” he answered when he asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, told his players in the last day of the game.
“ Tomorrow we have 12 important games, but we would like to start as quickly as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
When this trigger gets persistent, it's a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We created an appropriate setup and set the boys in a way, until we felt that tomorrow we would do something magical."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the battle and tackle Rory McIlroy in the best game, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“In this group of boys, I have decided for this order because I think it covers all the schedule”, said Bjorn on the choice of individuals.
New German warship rescheduled
The newest fregate of the German Navy should be transferred to the use of 2014 in order to replace the ageing warships from the cold war, but the failure of systems and rapidly increasing costs will not take place until the next year, local offices reported.
It is now transferred to the first half of the year 2019, a true officer of Die Zeit, citing the military representative.
The fleet should be joined by the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project saves worrying questions after delivery.
The four ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg, ordered in 2007, will be replaced by the ageing class of the Bremen class.
It is expected that they will have a strong cannon, a type of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft launches and some technology of cover-up, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer spaces between maintenance – the latest fregates are expected to remain outside the domestic port for up to two years.
Continuous delays, however, mean that top warships that would allow Germany to influence the overseas by the time they started using themselves will become obsolete, notes officer Die Ziet.
The unhappy fregate F125 appeared last year on covers when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That's when the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return are only little known, and the German conventions cited a number of key “programmic and technical deficiencies” that would make the warship useless if they put it on a battle mission.
The deficiencies of software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessel will manage the crew with about 120 sailors – only half of the workforce on the older frigates class Bremen.
It also turned out that the ship is strongly heavy, which reduces its capacity and restricts the navy's prospects for its future upgrade.
The 7000-tone "Rheinland-Pfalz" ship is supposed to be twice as difficult as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project has also become a problem – including the training of the crew.
This is intended to reach EUR 3.1 billion of vrtlings (3.6 billion USD) – from the beginning of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the seapower of Germany is reducing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy actually "falishes ships suitable for travel."
The official said that the question was consequently tightened because the old ships were degraded and the replacement vessels were not secured.
He regretted that the Navy couldn't join any Baden-Wuerttemberg ship.
The National Fund taps the secret life of bats
A new research in Scotland is being held in Scotland, where they seek to find out how non-topers use food in food hunting.
They hope that the results of newly illuminated the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help focus on future conservation activities.
In the research, the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) scientists will monitor small bats and small non-supports and brown arrests of non-shops and conduit batteries in Inverewe Gardens' property in Wester Ross area.
At key sites of the property, special cameras will be set up to monitor the activity of non-stopers throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also carry out mobile research using hand detectors.
The professional audio analysis of all the videos will confirm the frequency of non-speed calls and what kind of work they do.
Then they will prepare a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour throughout the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS adviser for the conservation of nature, hopes to show the results of which habitats are the most suitable for non-species and how each species uses them.
These information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the preservation of forests for non-species and other related species.
The number of net populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has been severely reduced in the last century.
They are jeopardised by construction and development work that affects refugees and the loss of habitat.
The risks also represent wind turbines and lightings, as well as muhols and some types of chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks of house cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
Because of the night habits of hunting hunting, they help each other with their ears more than with their eyes.
For the precise determination of errors and obstacles on the way of the year, they use a pre-finished echolocation technique.
NTS, responsible for the provision of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the intact very seriously.
He employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, security checks and occasional rescue.
At the Threave site in the Dumfries and Galloway area, the organization established even the first and for now the only Scottish reserve, especially intended for non-shops.
The manager of the possession of David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for bats on Threavo” he said.
“We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all quality habitat.
However, much is still known about the bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us to understand better what they need to succeed."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of non-speakers prior to the implementation of the maintenance works on the property, as the potential unwilling destruction of one single family netholes could lead to the death of up to 400 females and youngsters, which could mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The oppressors are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish leader of the Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to cooperate.
She said: “We must still learn much about our bats, and we simply do not know how well their populations are holding. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape charges and lawyers are preparing for the German magazine's lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of rape, which is to be misinterpreted, marked as "fake news" and said that people want to "promove themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to press the German magazine with the news of Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus accused him of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that she was scheduled to pay 375,000 USD for silence.
During the talk of 142 million followers in Instagram Live video for hours after reporting, Ronaldo 33, reported as "fake news"
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said is false news," five times the Golden Ball winner said in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which belongs to the work I do.
I am a happy man and I want all good," the smiling player added.
Ronald's lawyers are being prepared for the Der Spiegel magazine's report for accusations, which were called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life".
Advocate Christian Schertz said that the player would require compensation for “an immune damage in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of a violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is expected to happen in June 2009 in the apartment of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the paperwork filed at the District Court of Clark in Nevada, she was supposed to be back in the Mayor's nightclub with Ronald in the actor's room, and she was supposed to be anally raped there.
The mayor claims that after the event was mentioned, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said that “99% is a good man” that disappoints only in “one percent”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but described it as a contractual one.
The mayor also argues that she was soliciting the police and that she was taken in the hospital by the photographs of her injuries and later agreed on an extra-judicial settlement because she was "fearfully afraid of revenge" and was concerned by "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old argues that she wants to cancel the settlement because the alleged event continues to be a serious trauma.
During his alleged attack, Ronaldo was just before the transposition from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, according to an agreement worth 100 million dollars, moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "forever regret" the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom would "forever regret" if it lost the status of leading world car manufacturer after Brexit, the business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerning" that Toyota UK told BBC that the exit of the Great Britain from the EU without agreement would temporarily stop production in the Burnastone factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effect of late on the border in the case of brexit without agreement could lead to loss of jobs.
Burnastone – producing Toyotina model Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that in the event that the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, production in our factory would be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyotin director at the Burnastone factory.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom, including Hondo, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concern about the outcome of the European Union without agreement.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit, she would close her Mina factory in Oxford in a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers are calling the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of brexites.
Toyota's production line operates according to the principle of "in the right time", with parts of the suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for cars on orders coming every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom left the EU on 29 March without an agreement, this could cause border disturbances for which representatives of the industries say that they could cause obstacles and parts shortages.
Toyota, in its factory in Derbyshire, could not store more than a day of parts, said the representatives of the company, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Therese May's plan for future relations with the EU "is precisely relevant for avoiding such border checks".
“We need to reach an agreement. We want to reach the best agreement that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to grab this opportunity”, he said about the broadcast Today's BBC Radio 4.
"The data are not only Toyote, but also other producers that we must be absolutely able to continue a highly successful supply chain set."
Toyota could not comment on how long the production would have been stopped and noted in the long term that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in the Burnastone factory for 24 years and is the founder of the Union's union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, the lost workplace never recovers. ”
The Government Representative said: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be transferred again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could be made in the event of the ongoing fight on the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for another week, said the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein controls the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is studying Russian pre-voluntary interference, links between Trump's co-workers and Russia and potentially the presidential obstacle to the judicial authority.
The question is whether Trump's ambassador to the Prosecutor General will forgive and threaten Mueller's independence, powering Washington talks for months.
At the beginning of the month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretapping device for recording talks with Trump and the possibility of the removal of the President on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, however, he visited the White House in the middle of a report on his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said that Rosenstein would've "better not forgiven" and the meeting was then transferred to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate's judicial committee, where they witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Fordov.
On Friday, Trump appointed a single investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's press representative, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date for him is not yet specified; it could have happened this week, according to everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, and we could have postponed it in another week.
We'll see. I always like to make sure you're informed."
Some rapporteurs would object to this, and Sanders hasn't called the White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
Chris Wallace's manager asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareities of the meetings were not to be attributed to the resistance to "setting" TV rapporteurs, but said: "I could not deny that they were set up."
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has several press conferences than any president has before him," she said, "We have seen the numbers without saying the source."
The meetings will still take place," Sanders said. "If journalists at the President of the United States can address their questions directly, this is infinitely better than discussing with me.
We are trying to allow this as much as possible and you have seen that we have done so often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference available to talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with nationals in guests.
Self-profile press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this week, when he appeared freely and partly bizarrely before the gathered journalists.
Letter from the Minister for Health of EU Workers in NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The EU health minister, who works at the Scottish NHS, wrote to express his appreciation to the state and to wish to continue the work after a brexite.
Jeane Freeman, SMEs, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom was released from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to paying the cost of applications to regulate the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “After the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the exit continued, as the decision was made this autumn approaching.
However, the United Kingdom government has also accelerated its preparations for a possible scenario of exit without agreement.
I know this has to be a great time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member regardless of its nationality.
Coworkers from all the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health sector's work and benefit patients and communities we provide.
You can feel at home in Scotland. We want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie urgently operated after head injury
Line supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was injured by the head in a Saturday defeat with 31:27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores team, reported by Mike the Authority from The Tennessean magazine.
The head coach of the Tennessee State University told reporters that the injuries only happened half-time ago.
“He came to the edge of the playground and there he was kind of grooming,” Reed said.
Coachs and medical staff provided Abercrombie on the edge of the playground with oxygen before putting it on the carriage and taking it out of the playground for further examination.
An official from the Tenneese State University told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering after surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “details on the type/range of injury are not yet known” and that the Tenneese State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently bruc, plays for the Tenneese State University for the first time after the transition from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he had five hits together before he left the game, and his total number of hits in the season rose to 18 hits.
A higher tax will be charged to foreign customers when buying property in the United Kingdom
A higher tax will be charged to foreign customers when buying property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used according to the new plans of Torians to help homeless people
The move will neutralise Corby's success to attract young voters
Increased colony will be charged by those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The treasurer expects to collect up to 120 million pounds a year. It will be intended to help homeless people.
Foreign customers will purchase property in the United Kingdom with a higher rate of crops and money collected will be paid to homeless people and Theresa May will be sent today.
The move should be taken as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide price-accessible housing and increased taxation of people with high income.
The elevated colony will be charged with persons and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, while additional money will encourage government's efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The revenue – which will be charged in addition to the current column, including the elevated levels introduced two years ago for other homes and property for broadcasting – could be less than three percent.
The treasureholder expects to collect up to 120 million GBP per year by introducing the measure.
Accordingly, 13 percent of newly built London real estate are expected to be purchased by the United Kingdom nationals, resulting in an increase in prices and the heavy purchase of the first real estate.
Many wealthy areas in the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost places”, as the number of buyers spending most of the time outside of the country is increased.
The new policy was adopted only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the hip to make young people easier to buy their first home.
The large construction companies accused the price increases by grabbing the country that is not actually used, and Mrs Mayevo called on to release the quotas for price accessible housing to repair the British 'life shame'.
Mr. Corbyn foretold an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the supervision of rentals and the completion of forced migration without mistakes.
He also wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “I said last year that I would devote my premier leadership to renew the British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our unfunctioning housing market.
Great Britain will be for people who want to live here, work and create their own life, always open.
But it can't be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and for foreign businesses to buy home is as simple as for garage British citizens.
For too many people, dreams of their own home are all too far away, and humiliation of homelessness remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to manage the club of Scotland"
Chief of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" was once to become the manager of the Scottish club.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of revival of the North-East Club, which currently holds the third place in the First League, with three points less than the first-class.
On the Stadium of Light, he moved to the summer after St. Mirren took again to the Scotland Championship in the last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I received a B cap and that was it," Ross said about the BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with a common observation of Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that dragged me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I had been successful in running the club."
Ross' predecessors at the head of Sunderland were Dick Advocaate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of the Alloa Athletic team, who has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as a successor of such great names, he did not feel fear.
“The success is measured for me by the question ‘Can I take this club back to the First League?’”.
According to the structure and capacity, this club certainly belongs to the First League," he said.
"The way there is not easy, but it would probably be successful only if the club could take it there again."
Ross has only been running the manager for three years since he was the assistant leader in Dumbarton and 15 months part of the Hearts coach.
Alloi then helped to prevent the fall into the third league, and St. Mirren led from the edge to the title of championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during the Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This was probably a real breakthrough” he remembered taking over Alloe.
"I was truly convinced that managership was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny, because I was doing well, with this situation I was having a good time, and I also made certain greater successes.
But the game can become challenging.
We need to face many things every week.
In the sense of stress and pressure at work, I still deal with it, but management simply feels like the right thing for myself.
I always wanted to run the club and now I do it. In my skin, I feel more comfortable in my entire adult life.”

Research results: ideal time for beer is Saturday at 17.30.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of difficultly smashing British pubs, but the pressure on the restaurant chain has also increased.
In July, pub groups and bars increased sales by 2.7 per cent, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant of the CGA, who prepared the data, said: “The permanent sunny time and participation of England in the world’s scale, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June in the past month, when the revenue of pubs increased by 2.8 percent, only that the restaurants were more affected.
The decline in transport in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June increased in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased compared to each other more than the restoration traffic decreased.
As a result of the sunny weather, the sale in pubs offered mostly food, but not as dramatic as in restaurant managers.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6 percent in one month and the sale of food decreased by three percent."
Paul Newman, a group of analysts for free time and hospitality, said: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The largest factors of time and impact of large social or sporting events remain in the sale on the guest market.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to fight, even though the fall of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
For local owners with food, a long hot summer could not come at a more irregular time and only the time will tell whether the need for recovery will bring more moderate temperatures that we have experienced in August."
The total sale in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, implying the slow introduction of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, sales criteria in the pub, bars and restaurants, collects and analyses data on the performance of 47 business groups with total traffic of more than 9 billion pounds and is an industrial reference established.
One of the five children has a secret account on the social network hidden from parents
The study showed that one of the five children — some of whom only 11 years old — has a secret account hidden from parents and teachers on the social network
A poll between 20,000 pupils showed the growth of false Instagram pages
News has strengthened fears of publishing with sexual content
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "maintaining" account intended for parents
One of five children — some of whom are only 11 years old — creates an account hidden from parents on social networks.
The poll between 20,000 pupils has shown rapid growth of false Instagram accounts.
The news has strengthened fears of publishing with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the pupils said that they manage the censorized "the main" account shown to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally ran into the secret page of the 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter invited visitors to rape her.
The research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Directors and Directors' Conference (HMC) of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of the 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them acknowledge that they have a private account.
President HMC Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers undergo temptation and create a website where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "vote of athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletics Committee as the Executive Director of the Annual General Assembly of the Management Board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athletes in the field and on the free and President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who direct sports to exploit its extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletical Community. We are convinced that the athletics in Scotland would have gained great gains with its involvement in the board”, Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a vote for the athletes, and I hope that I can really contribute and help to conduct sports in Scotland. ”
The American , who won from the total four Olympic medals in the course of 200 meters and 400 meters in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for BBC, remained unable to speak after the transitional ischaemic attack.
On Twitter, he wrote: “About a month ago, I got hit by a drop.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it was only time he would tell me if I could recover and to some extent.
Work was hard, but I was fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm conducting agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!»
An ad for the chest pump, which compares mothers to cows, has distributed online opinions
The company that produces chest pumps shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers to cows at the mule.
For the start of the marketing of the "first silent transmission of the chest" the Elvie Consumer Technique company published a provocative video ad that is intended to show mothers all the freedom that the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in the hay filled with hay, on the song, which includes the following text: “Yes, I am pumping myself, and there is no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my breasts, these are my tits”.
The assembly continues: “Get out, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze my breasts. ”
But the ad published on the Facebook website caused significant deterrence online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many said that he was joking on the account of the “gross” dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also become pregnant and scotty to produce milk, but the children steal them in the first days after the cotitus," she wrote one.
Elvie finger pump fits discreetly into breast-feeding bruising (Elvie/Mother)
The second commented: “Of course it is traumatic for both mother and young man.
But why not use them to advertise the chest pump for mothers holding their children?"
Someone added: “The ad is completely unbelievable. ”
Others praised the ad, and one of the women confessed that the song “would seem to be devastating. ”
“This seems a genius idea to me.
I'd buy it myself if I still had a breast-feeding.
When I was pumping, I felt exactly like a cow.
The ad is a couple of crazy, but I understood it, just like it was meant.
It's a genius product," she wrote another.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that aims at mothers who exhauste milk (commonly in the workplace or in the bathroom) and feel like cows. ”
This is not an ad that would praise or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they danced with hidden pumps in the blue.
The concept of action is that many women who draw their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump pump is completely quiet, has no wire or tube and is discreetly attached to the breast-feeding bruise, which allows women to move, keep the child and even activities free during the milk pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and an ECD at mothers, further commented. "The pump Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and provocative presentation."
With a parallel between women who draw milk and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milk pumps and all of its challenges into the spotlight, and in the fun way that women can connect, to show an amazing feeling of freedom that a new pump will bring.
This is not the first case when Elvie pump came to the front page.
During the London Week of fashion, the mother of two children walked on the model path to designer Marto Jakubowski when she used the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants moved quietly to a tent camp at the Texas border
The number of retained children of migrants has risen strongly, even if the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to hand over the child to sponsors.
It is traditionally most of the sponsors of unused migrants, so they are afraid to endanger their own opportunities in the country with a child's request.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities reported that potential sponsors and other household members would have to issue fingerprints and share data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, witnessed before the convention that the agency had arrested ten people who requested to sponsor minors without escorts.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had no prior criminal evidence.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are punished foreigners.
This is why we continue searching for these individuals," said Mr. Albance.
In order to address children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within one month after they were detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, said the workers in the shelter.
Many will show themselves with a video conference call and not personally to advocate against the immigration judge.
Those who are not entitled to aid will be expelled quickly.
As far as children are in custody, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts of escape after the statements of workers in the detention and reports in the system in recent months.
The advocators said that your concerns were greater in larger institutions, e.g. Tornilla, where signs of childhood distress due to their size are likely to remain unprecedented.
They added that the transfer of children to the tents without emotionally preparing them or giving them an opportunity to say a letter from friends may complicate the grass that many of them are dealing with.
Syria urges American, French and Turkish "crowding forces" to withdraw immediately
In the speech of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though war is taking place in the country for the eighth year.
The Moual, who also performs the mission of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces on the Syrian soil were illegal, under the threat of combating terrorism, and that they would “conform to this also. ”
“Unfortunately and unconditionally they must withdraw”, he said to the congregation.
Moualem said that "the war against terrorism" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people died since 2011 and millions had to leave their homes, "nearly finished".
He said that Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until the Syrian territory was cleared” by both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
In Syria, the United Nations have about 2,000 soldiers who train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar Al-Asada.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country in the war.
Regarding the fugitives, Moualem said that the conditions for them are suitable for return, and obligated “some Western countries” for“ spreading unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to remain abroad.
“The international community and humanitarian organisations have been invited to contribute to their easier return”, he said.
"They are changing the political issue, which should be an exclusive humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union warned Syria not to receive renewable funds until Assad and the opposition reached an agreement on the end of the war.
The graduates of the United Nations say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last important opposition of rebels, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement prevented a large attack of Syrian forces supported by Russia on a province in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military mediation will be directed against the Djihadiste, including the fighters from Front Nusr associated with Al-Qaeda, which "bode eradicated".
The United Nations Ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes that he will soon call the first meeting of the new committee drawn up by members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and press the way to the elections.
Moualem identified the conditions of the Syrian Government for participation in the committee, saying that the work of the committee should be limited to "examine the articles of the current constitution" and warned before interference.
Why Trump will reach a second term
After this conclusion, Mr Trump will win at the re-election elections in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency will soon end with interpelling and scandal.
Which would be without doubt "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
So far, there are no signs of the fatigue of viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's rating has been more than doubled to 1.05 million and the MSNBC rating has nearly increased to 1.6 million.
The Fox News channel has an average of 2.4 million viewers at the time of the highest rating, which, according to Nielsen, was more than four years ago, when he had 1.7 million, and the show "The Rachel Madddow Show" on the MSNBC channel reached the largest number of cable customers with 3.5 million viewers at night of important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it is something that we do not understand” said Neal Baer, the head of the drama “Designed Survivor” (Claimed survivors), about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, recognized comedy and authors of the book “Just funny shares: and some hard truths about spying in the Hollywood Boys Club” offers a different explanation.
Remember the ride with a taxi in Boston before elections in 2016.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“ He said, “Because he makes me laugh”, she told me.
The chaos is a fun value.
Of course, contrary to what it looks like on TV, the story from Washington could decide on the future of the Roa case against Wad, given whether immigrant families can reunite and health of the global economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the six-hour viewing of the round table of experts who are discussing the use of the source "from the deep background" for the book "Scare" Bob Woodward, 15,000 USD of valuable leather jackets ("the clothing, thickly covered with gas", said Officer The Washington Post) and the result of shocking descriptions of Trump's, khm, anatomy.
Sam, for example, I will never look at Super Maria the same again.
“The part of his beginning, which impresses the reality show, is to offer something every night”, said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator broadcasts “Pawn Stars” on the company of Trump's show and daily scripts (two with N.F.L., commendation by Kim Jong Una).
You can't afford to let go of any episode, otherwise you're stuck.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, he was outside his home on the north coast of Kauai the sun's 80 degrees (26.7 °C), but he was stuck inside when he recorded CNN.
He was unable to disarm himself even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and hung the future of the Supreme Court in the air.
“I remember that at that time we created all these crazy shows and people said, “This is the end of Western civilization”,” said Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought this was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

External money is made to prepare for the most intermediate parliamentary elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th Pennsylvania district there is a flood of money, as two candidates were in the race for the same seat because of the rearrangement of the conventional districts.
This recently to the newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is the home of the Democratic representative of Conor Lamba, who won his seat in special elections this spring in the second district.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, the Republican man Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12 district, which is strongly covered by the new 17 county.
The maps were drawn to a new one when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court of January ruled that the old districts were constituently drawn in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th district touched the fight to finance the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congress Committee for Democratic campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became the famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widespread March special elections for the 18th county of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators give the Democrats a little advantage.
In the United States, they were considering sanctions against Salvador for the support of China, and then they retreated.
Diplomatics have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with just a little opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with President Panama Juan Carlos Varelo and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled Trump's leaders.
Officials of the Foreign Ministry decided to revoke the American diplomatic mission leaders in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama are "new decisions on the termination of Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, representative of the Ministry at the beginning of the month.
However, sanctions were considered on Salvador, which, according to the 2017 estimates, would receive 140 million US aid, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions that included the restriction of financial assistance and the targeted visa issue limit would have affected this medium-American country with great unemployment and the number of homicides.
During the course of the internal meetings, the North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic development that would continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration in the direction of the United States.
By mid-September, however, the top government officials explained that they wanted the conference to continue, thus completing their thoughts on the penalties for Salvador.
The Vice-President Mike Pence is now responsible to talk to the participants of the conference, which is now planned for the middle of October, which is a sign of the importance attributed by the US government to the meeting, added diplomats.
The three American ambassadors returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to talk about them under the anonymity condition.
Their testimony confirmed an external analyst close to the government and also spoke on this subject of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report of Robert Mueller's special adviser on the possible impediment of the judicial authority, which is now in public records of very many evidence.
Mr. Mueller was also supposed to point the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign was working with Russia in attacking American elections.
If the congress changes its hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities and perhaps even before the jury of his colleagues at the moment he prepares to reconvey his voters.
There are many questions in this regard and I do not want to claim that Mr. Trumpa's fall is inevitable, as well as his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long a struggle could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike Hitler if the West resisted and in Munich supported Czechoslovakia.
We failed, so we missed the opportunity to avoid the year of worship that followed.
In such fractures, the stream of history is changed and accelerates or inhibits an unprospected march of democracy.
The Americans are dealing with several of these fractures right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisss Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this officer reported that he proposed a secret recording of the president last year and speculated about his inappropriateness for this position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the report of Officer The Times was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the requested inquiry by the FBI of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhausted or fair or appointed as Supreme Judge despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And in particular, will we vote in the interim elections for a congress that will require Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail on these tests, there's a long winter democracy waiting for us.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was the Czechoslovakian Judean, deported in Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once took over my ambassador's home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she ordered me to light the whistle candles on the scroll table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before dealing with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rapid Vienna will be hosted by the Rapid Vienna, and it is clear that it will win them over the Austrians after an impressive remission against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month to be a convincing position for qualifications from the G European League Group.
The knee injury to Graham Dorrans was prevented from appearing before 2-2 against Villarreal in the season, but he believes that the Rangers could use this as a jump-off for greater achievements.
“This was a earned point for us because Villarreal is a strong team”, said 31-year-old.
“We have entered the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take away the point.
We may eventually be able to win, but the overall remake is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were a better side in the other half.
On Thursday there will be another large European night.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a tough game because in the last game they have achieved a good result, but with a crowd behind us I'm sure we can work and achieve a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, given everything that happened, including injuries and changes in the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success."
A poor sleeper of women for fear of savings
Despite the fact that the surveyors had a clear idea of how to take care of them, only few people should talk to their family members about it.
Half of the research surveys of the Insurance Officer Nationwide said that the spouses were discussing the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking about this with children.
“People want to care for them as a family member, but they do not try to talk about it”, said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector at the Nationwide Insurance.
You can start in the following way.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare the family for your care if you don't talk to her on time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, because this can be an important factor in assessing costs.
Include the financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing of long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own resources if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare to legal battles on the transition.
Choose a healthcare representative to determine trustworthy persons who will monitor your health care and ensure that professionals respect your health wish if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the authorization of a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not able to do so alone.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents need medical help and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Please write these information into the action plan to be prepared.
“It's not just about your finances. Do you know doctors?” Martin asked.
“What medicines are you taking?
“Who will take care of the dog?
I have this plan prepared."

earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Palu Indonesian city on Friday, said officials and the number of victims were expected to increase.
In the event of discontinued communications, Rescueers from the Regent of Donggal, the area north of Paluj, nearer to the epicentre of the magnitude of 7.5 earthquake, could not obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Paluo after the earthquake.
A few key information on Paluj and Donggala at Sulavezi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavezi, a province that lies at the end of the narrow Gulf on the west coast of Sulavezi and is expected to have 379.800 population in 2017.
The city celebrated the 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck him.
It is a landscape that extends more than 300 km long (180 miles) of the coast in the northwest of Sulavezi Island.
The Regent, the administrative unit under the province, had 299,000 population in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of the Central Sulaves are aquaculture and farming, particularly in the central region of Donggala.
In the province there is also an important activity for mining nickel, which is mostly held in Morvali, on the opposite side of Sulavesia.
After the report by the Indonesian Agency to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters over the last 100 years, Palu and Donggalo repeatedly affected tsunami.
In 1938, tsunami died more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
In 1996, the tsunami also struck the northern Dongalo and caused the death of nine people.
Indonesia sits on an earthquake active Pacific fire ring, so the earthquakes occur regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis were the following:
2004: The larger earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the northern Sumatri on 26 December caused tsunami which affected 14 countries and which killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian assessment, more than half in Aceh.
2005: The type of strong earthquakes affected the western Sumatro late March and early April.
A hundred people died on the island of Nias by the Sumatra coast.
2006: The earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the southern part of Java, the most populated Indonesian island, and triggered tsunami that flooded its southern coast and caused death by nearly 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: The earthquake of magnitude 7,5 affected one of the islands of Mentawai and triggered tsunami up to 10 meters that destroyed the dozens of villages and caused death of approximately 300 people.
2016: Swimming earthquake affected the Regentship of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami did not trigger, but the crashed buildings caused more than 100 people to die.
2018: The major earthquakes affected the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and caused death by more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Arrest of Sarah Palin's eldest son for family violence
Track Palina, the eldest son of the former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for the charges of the attack.
29-year-olds from Wasilla, Alaska, were arrested for suspicion of violence in the family, opposing the application of violence in the family and resisting arrest, police agency Alaska State Troopers reported on Saturday.
After the police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report a alleged offence, took the phone from her hand.
The Palin has been detained at the Precased Foundation of Mat-Su and is in custody under unsafe guarantee of 500 USD, reported the KTUU television network.
In the court, he appeared on Saturday, where he pronounced himself "definitely innocent" when he was asked about the conspiracy, the network reported.
The Palin was accused of three violations of Class A, which means that they could close him up to one year and punish him with a fine of 250,000 USD.
He was also charged with one class B violation, which is punished by one day in prison and a depth of 2000 USD.
The Palin of a felony was not accused for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking the father, Todd Palin.
Mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported an alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of violence in the family, involvement in the reporting of violence in the family and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girl said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son with post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service to Iraq.
Contress with tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake that hit the island of Sulavezi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake of magnitude 7,5 triggered tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electric and communication networks are disconnected and death victims are expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just next to the central Sulavezi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
The social media is circulating videos showing the moment of earthquake.
When he hit tsunami by the shore, hundreds of people were retained in Palu at the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors require a rare death penalty for the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York require a death penalty for Cyfull Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died.
Saipov, 30, is scheduled to use a shipping truck to carry out an attack along the West Side Highway in the Under Manhattan on October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious physical injuries, it is written in the notification of the request for death penalty lodged in the Southern District of New York.
According to the judicial paper, the cause of a death penalty may be any of the charges.
For weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury of Saipov briefed the accusation in 22 points, including eight murder charges to help extort federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and plots", said prosecutors, who described Saipov's way as "extraordinary, cruel and expelled".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Draka, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccoa”, is written in the notice of intention.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court of Southern District sentenced the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was sentenced to murder of two drug suppliers, and finally changed his sentence in September 2009 to life in prison.
The death penalty was last sentenced in New York in the federal case in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were killed because of the conspiracy of spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed on the power table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, the citizen of Uzbekistan, in the days and months following the attack, has not shown regret in the court documents.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he felt good about what he did.
After the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he saw on the phone to perform the attack.
The police also said that they demanded the dismantling of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
With regard to 22 points of indictment, the defendant was pronounced guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said that they were “ominously disappointed” by the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to request a death penalty instead of accepting the recognition of guilt in return for life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved only will prolong suffering in these events”, Patton said.
Saip's defense team asked the prosecutors not to demand death sentences before that.
NIGELA FARAGEA should be obliged to negotiate on the Brexit, a true Torian Member
Nigel Farage today, during a protest at the Torian conference, promised that he would “mobilize a human army. ”
The former leader of the Ukip said the policy must "feel the heat" of Euroskeptics when one of its own Members Therese May suggested that it should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
The Conservative Member Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that the United Kingdom would "be out now" if Mr Farage was Mr Farage's secretary for Brexit.
However, the challenge faced by Ms. Mayev in coordinating its deep-separed species was highlighted by the Torians, favoured to the Brexit, who joined a separate protest against brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is seeking to maintain its plan in force during the attacks of brexite defenders, opponents of brexites and the EU.
Allies insisted that Maya's efforts to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and to force Euroskeptics and Laboratorians to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bone is at the Leaving Means Leave (Department means leaving) to Solihul that “he wants to get rid of Chequers.”
He said that Mr Farage should be appointed as a spokesperson and given him responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
This Member from Wellingborough added: “I will support the brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers. ”
He described his EU opposition in the following words: “In world wars we did not fight to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to adopt our own laws."
Mr Bone rejected the proposals that since the 2016 vote, the public opinion has changed: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely unrealistic."
At the meeting, Torian brexist Andrea Jenkinns, who said to the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Ministry President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, and the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unavoidable to our party and our activists who are active on the streets and bring us to election at all.
Please relax Chequers and start listening."
In a message intended for Mrs. Mayeve, she added: “The Prime Ministers maintain their job when they fulfill their promises. ”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that policy needs to be given "feeling the heat" if they intend to make the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
“They are trying to issue a brexit, and today we gathered together to say, ‘We will not allow you to do so’.
He added to the enthusiast: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the issue of brexite, to feel fever. ”
"We are mobilising the human army of this country that has won us in brexit, and we will not retire until we become independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the resters walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting in the city center.
After the establishment of the group this weekend, a foot of activists waved with the flags of Torians against brexit.
The Laburist noble Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives because of the security problems with the application of the party after the conference was opened.
“These are people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for a limit without stopping, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a perfect farce.
There is nothing like a good brexite," he added.
Warren will "exactly explore the position of the president"
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren says that "the participation in the presidential event will be carefully studied" after the November elections.
The The Boston Globe journal reports that the Massachusett Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical to President Donald Trump, will move again in November against the Republicanian Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chair of Trump's electoral campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is in the centre of speculation to be able to deal with Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was its 36th meeting with voters in the form of the city hall since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if he intends to move for the president.
Warren replied that it is time for a woman to "good in Washington and repair our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top."
Arrest after the death of LSU Simsa player in shooting
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported on Saturday that she arrested a suspect for shooting a player of the LSU Wayda Simsa basketball.
The police station in Baton Roug sent a message about the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at the press conference at 11:00 A.M.
They posted a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help in identifying the man on the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died”, reported the network of 247 Sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul, media.
Wayde was involved in protecting a friend, and Simpson shot him.
At the hearing, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene of a murder weapon and that he shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resisting and was detained to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter young man who grew up in Baton Roug, played 32 games with 10 starts, average from 17,4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps to the game in the last season.
Russian Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approached the World Championship title, and the team ordered him to let Sebastian Vettl win
On Saturday, it became the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, clearly that "the Mercedes' team will have a strong impact on the race".
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton in dry when he defended his position in the first two bandages and invited Vettle to attack his men's colleague.
Vettel took first into the boxing box and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes took into the box later and left him behind Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after a few driving actions that the Ferraria driver's inclination leaves the internal side open and risking that after two defensive moves in the third corner, he would be left behind.
Max Verstappen began with the latest type of network and was until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday in the seventh place.
After that, the majority of the tireless-changing game was in place to perform the fast finishing, hit Kimi Raikkonen, and take the fourth city.
He finally took to the 44th Round, but in the remaining eighth circles, he couldn't increase his speed, so the fourth city was seized by Raikkonen.
It's a hard day, because Valteri had been driving fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me by.
The team has done a really remarkable job to reach the first and second place," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body rumour.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence that she did not disclose Christine Blasey Ford's letter, who was the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly touch the testimony of Ford before the Senate investigation commission, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, corrupt and false”.
“The only good thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last days that we can see anger when you can see that people are mean, corrupt and false”, he said.
“ When you look at publications and disclosures, people say, “No, I didn’t do that. ”
I didn't do this."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you find out?
Remember her answer... you uncovered the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I have not revealed it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it... no, we didn't," he added about the impression of the senator.
Ford sent a letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the media was disclosed in early September – but Feinstein's denial that it came from her office.
“I did not hide the charges of Dr. Ford, and I did not disclose her letter,” she told the Commission after reports by Officer The Hill Feinstein.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I kept him confidential as she asked."
But her denial obviously did not correspond to the president, who said at Saturday night's meeting: “I tell you, this was a really bad speech of the body.
It may not be true, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
In defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president suggested that the Democrats of the accusations are abused for their own purposes.
“They are determined to gain their strength again with all possible means.
You have seen malice, abomination, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to get over to power and control," the president said after reporting the Mediaite website.

Air traffic controller has allowed hundreds of people on the plane to escape from earthquake with their death
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are celebrating as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that the plane with hundreds of people could have flew safely.
During Friday’s earthquake on the island of Sulaveza, followed by tsunami, more than 800 people died and many were missing.
The area continues to stress strong earthquakes, and many people are trapped in the ruins of Pala.
While counterparts fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a strongly floating control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport Palu.
It remained in it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight path, could have flew safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought he was pulling up.
He died later at the hospital.
The representative of Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved a hundred lives, reports Australian media house ABC News.
We've got a helicopter ready to take him from Balikpana to Kalimantan to a major hospital elsewhere.
Sorry we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
“The hearts are marketing when we hear this,” he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of death victims could reach thousands, as the State's State mitigation Agency said that access to cities in Dongala, Sigi and Boutonga is limited.
“The count of the dead was expected to increase because there were many bodies under the ruins and many were unable to reach it,” said the representative of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves, up to six meters tall.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supply.
Risa Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings the bodies.
He's running out of clean water.
Minimarkets have been dug up everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Idonezian Red Cross rushes to help survive, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy that can become much worse."
On Sunday, the President of Indonesia, Joko Widododo, arrived in Pala, convincing the National Army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?" According to the CNN report.
In early this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini airline now says that after crashing the plane in the lagoon, one man is missing
The airline, which managed the flight that struck into the quiet ocean lagoon in Micronesia, now says they are missing one man after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the flooding plane.
Air Niugini said in the post on Saturday afternoon that a male gender traveller was missing.
In the airline, they said that in search of a missing person, they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
At a call for more passenger data such as his age or nationality, they did not respond immediately.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane hit by water when attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
In the airline, eight passengers left in a stable state in the hospital on Saturday.
The cause of striking and precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy reported that the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"This is extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that along with other passengers, he was able to pass through the passage of water to emergency exits on a flooding plane.
He said the stewardess panicked and cried, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy also said that the sailors who were in the vicinity repaired the plea were able to help themselves with the use of a boiling boat that led people to the ground before the plane was sank into about 30 meters (100 shoes) deep water.
Data from the Air Niugina Security Network indicate that 111 people died in the last two decades in air accidents in Papua-Nova Guinea, but this is the first accident that happened to Air Niugina.
The analyst set the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution presented its evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
The analyst of the US Ministry of Justice Paul Rowlett has been acquainted for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone recordings to determine the movement of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said that he received the information on the location from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which opposes his previous claims, was reported by Officer The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone at Chambers was at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town this day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was “lied because he was [my] truck in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that when Chambers died, he knew about two weeks.
The footage on the cell phone indicates they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, at the time of Chambers' death, deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present the final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said that the jury was to be judged later this day.
The High Breed: What is a conscious hiphop?
The Hiphop trio wants to provoke a negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that the hiphop has distant from the original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and make a conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have recently experienced a revival with artists, such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
New York Nanny sues a couple because they fired her because of the "racist" message
The New York Nanny sued a couple because they discriminated her after receiving the wrongly sent message to the mother who complained that she was "one black."
A couple denys racist behavior and compares the lawsuit with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, expressed disappointment in 2016 when the new nanny Giselle Maurice arrived, found that she was a black girl.
“ NEEEEEEEEE ONE Montenegro”, in a message to her husband, Ms. Plasco-Flaxmann wrote.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice's.
After finding her backfire, Plasco-Flaxmann, who felt "uncomfortable", fired Mrs. Maurice, saying that her arriving nanny, who was a African-American, was doing a bad job, so she wanted to hire Philippines, reported an officer in New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice received a one-day job payment, and then she and Uber sent her home.
Maurice now requests compensation from the Court of Justice, which is 350 USD per day for a six-month period for the performance of the work for which it was initially hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them, you know, these things are not done," she said about Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the racist accusations, claiming that Maurice’s forgiveness was reasonable because they feared that they would no longer be able to trust her after despair.
“Woman sent her something she didn't want to say.
No racist.
We are not a racist," the husband of Joel Plasco said about Post.
“Will you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if this happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Compared to the case with "immigration" Plasco said that his wife had only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Will you deal with someone like this?
This is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the proceedings before the court are still taking place, the court of public opinion has condemned a couple on social networks because of its behaviour and the way of thinking.
Paddington Bear Paddington's publishers feared that the readers would not connect with a speaking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said: “It is hard to put herself in the skin of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It is very fun to find out now that Paddington has become an extraordinary success."
She said that her father, who first worked as a cameraman for BBC, before he got the inspiration to write a baby book about a little bear toys, was bitter when he refused his work, added that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book "grenko-sweet".
Regarding the bear Paddington, described as “very important member of our family”, she said that his father was very proud of his final success.
“He was these people who didn't like to brag about it,” she said.
“But since Paddington Bear was so real for him, it was almost the same as if something was achieved by your child: You are proud of him even if you do not do it alone.
I believe that the success of the Paddington bear was viewed in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, success was always attributed to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
At the landing, her daughter was transferred to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nica, where doctors tried to keep her life for nothing.
"She regularly called to say that she really felt bad that she didn't expect it to happen," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I received Nad’s call. He told me that in the next two minutes he would die, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her doctors to continue her heart were slowly conceived and abandoned her system.
She's been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a position when I was surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold on."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who now regretted her daughter's loss, boarded on the plane along with other passengers, not aware of the test that ends.
"No one knew," she said.
“I had my head removed, and my faces were running tears all the time.
It is difficult to explain, but on the plane I felt this strong feeling of compassion to Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Sad female leprosy posters for the prevention of suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved person because of suicide try to turn others away to take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the valley bridge posters with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him after his smile.
They always said that his smile lighted every room."
However, he stopped working before death because he was “in a truly dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a relative when he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I keep worrying about the effect of Domain. ”
Mrs. Davis made posters, “to let other people know that people you can turn to and talk to even if it is a friend.
Don't sit in silence – you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, depressed or otherwise," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day he was completely on the ground. When the children opened the gifts, he didn't establish eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was severe for them, but they have to process it: “She cut the hole into the whole family.
She's tearing us apart.
But we must continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs at the start of the FBI investigation in the air
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after the duration and extent of the limited investigation, this might unite us”, said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the world would be afflicted by a "degradation of the party".
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time the investigation would take place.
Until the interim elections that will take place on November 6th, there are only five weeks left - if the Republicans are expected to cut off poorly, this will very weaken them in attempting to select the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly phoned the senators to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh's support, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who was present by his present wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI agency prepares a report?
In the Senate currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, the vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring a breakthrough from the path of position and election to the Supreme Court of Justice to Mike Pence.
The number of North Korean refugees decreased under Kima
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea fell since Kim Jong U came to power seven years ago, the South Korean Member said.
Byong-seug Park, referring to the data of the South Korean Association Ministry, said 1127 people fled last year compared to 2706 2011.
Mr Park said that the key factors were the stricter control of the border between North Korea and China and the increase in the price required by human smugglers.
Pjongjang has not made this public yet.
The large majority of North Korean refugees finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953 illegally crossed more than 30,000 North Koreans.
Most of them flee China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to pass than a strongly secured demilitarised area between both Koreans.
China counts refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South — technically still in the war — have been significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pjongjang on talks focusing on the stalled talks on denuclearisation.
This happened after a June historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on efforts for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho gave the American sanctions the imprisonment of that time.
“Without confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves”, Mr. Ri said Mr. Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi marked Bretta Kavanaugh as a “historic” and says he is not suitable for a job at the Supreme Court.
The minority head of the House of Representative Nancy Pelosi named the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh as “hysterical” and said that it was substantially inappropriate for the office in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi was thus present in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can't think of anyone else as if the woman, if she was so familiar, would be marked as “hysterical”,” Kavanaugh's Thursday's testimony against the Senate investigation commission commented on Pelosi's.
Kavanaugh severely denied the accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were still teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, he was overwhelmingly screaming and discussing his family and secondary school years of souls.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Commission and accused himself of “grotesque and harmonised mud” organised by the liberals, angry because Hillary Clinton lost in 2016 in the presidential elections.
Pelosi said that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he should not be appointed as a Supreme Judge, as it demonstrated that he was partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that with such statements and the way Clinton and Democrats dealt, he discredited," she said.
Pelosi's question is whether against Kavanaugh will try to file a constitutional charge if it is confirmed and the Democrats will receive most in the House of Representatives, for a moment.
"I will say this – if the Congress or the FBI does not speak the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Inviting Court in Washington.
Pelosi said that as a democratic concern, the possible decision of Kavanaugh against the Act of Accessible Healthcare or the case Roe v. Wad, as it is considered as a conservative judge.
In its confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided the question whether he would revoke some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now it is not time to go hysterical, biased person to court and expect us to say ‘Isn’ not that wonderful?’” said Pelosi.
And a woman's got to squeeze him.
It's a fair outburst, after months and years of anger spilling, and it can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," she told me 45 years later.
"It doesn't seem very rare to me, what do you think?"
She continued: “I was deeply helped by a woman who was a director, who also cried when she was angry, but developed the technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘ Maybe I feel sad to you because I cry.
I'm angry.”
And then she just kept going.
This seemed excellent to me."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger partly because people misunderstand them.
One of my most powerful memories from my early career when I was still working in the office, where a man prevailed, once crying in an inexplicable rage, was the event when an older woman grabbed me by the neck — a cold leader who was always a little afraid of me who dragged me to the stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
“They will not understand that you are angry.
They will think you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have touched you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart in his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was stumbled in a trip across a boat called Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, Mrs. Schroeder deeply confirmed that there was no reason why she couldn't run for the president alone.
"This was not a well-thinked decision," she said 30 years later in laughter.
"Seven other candidates took part in the game, and another was the last necessary thing at that time.
Someone then named the game "Sneak and seven thumbs".
Since the campaign joined the last, she laged in the collection of funds, so she decided not to enter the game if she did not collect 2 million USD.
It was a lost battle.
It found that some of her supporters, who gave men 1,000 USD, gave it only 250 USD.
“Do they think I'm gonna get a discount?” she wondered.
When she said that she would not start a formal campaign, her emotions – the appreciation of the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to collect the money and focus on the voters instead of the delegates, and the anger of sexism – so overcome that she began to boost herself.
“We would think I had a nervous breakdown”, Mrs Schroeder recalled the media reactions.
"We would think that my official sponsor is Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my backstone.
“Was she crying?”
How the United States and China could benefit Beijing
The initial trade war salsas between the United States and China were deaf, and even though the battle has not been over recently, experts say that it could benefit from Beijing for the long term.
Donald Trump, the US President, launched the first warning at the beginning of the year by taxing key Chinese exports products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new trade tariffs worth 200 billion USD (150 billion GBP), which effectively means taxing half of all the goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has been avenged every time with equivalent refund measures, last with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent per US goods worth 60 billion USD.
China, the second largest economy in the world, has committed to moving an eye for the eye with the United States and probably not going to blur soon.
In order to back down Washington, China should agree to its demands, but the public removal of the United States for Chinese President Shi Jinping would be too embarrassing.
However, experts say that, if Beijing knows how to pull the right moves, the US pressures in the trade war would have a positive impact on China in order to reduce each other's dependence on both economies in the long term.
“The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger economic concussion in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have considered so far”, said Abigail Grace, a professional co-worker focusing on Asia in the brain trust of the Center for New American Security.
Syria is "prepared" to return refugees, the real foreign minister
Syria says she is willing to return refugees voluntarily and asks for assistance in the rebuilding of the country devastated in over seven years of the lasting war.
In the speech of the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation in the field is today due to the fight against terrorism more stable and safer," he said.
The government continues to repair the areas that terrorists have destroyed to restore the normal situation.
All the conditions are now met that refugees who had to be returned voluntarily to the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and survival.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have escaped from the country since the start of the 2011 war.
The other six million people who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid to the restoration of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries sponsored by rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Chapel in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup for 2018 with the final score of 16,5 against 10,5 at Le Golf National in Paris.
The US has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder's treaty since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14,5 points needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through the majority of the championship, shot the game at the 16th hole in a pair of three games at his initial ball in the water and had to hand the game over to Francesca Molinaria.

“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It was hard this year.

We pushed Europe for a second in the morning.
We failed.
A cloak down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We'll have to reassociate, I'll be working with the U.S. PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I really love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
Capo down.
They played us."
