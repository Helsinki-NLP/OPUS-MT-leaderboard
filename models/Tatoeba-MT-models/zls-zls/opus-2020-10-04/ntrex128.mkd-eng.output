The members of the National Assembly of Wells are concerned that they “look like mappets ”
Some of the members of the congregation are astonished by the proposal to change their name to the MWP (Article of the Welsh Parliament).
This comes from plans to change the name of the congregation in the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the congregation of the entire political spectrum are concerned that it can be a subject of ridicule.
A Labour Party Assembly member said his party is concerned that "he rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who don't speak German: in Welsh twp, it means "fuckin' crazy", and pwp means "soka".
Plaid's member said the party is "not completely happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party is "free-minded" about the change of the name, but noted that the similarity of MWP and "mapet" (ang. Muppet) is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly with the Yorkshire-English excuse of the letter "u".
The Commission of the National Assembly, which is currently drafting a law to introduce changes to the name, said: "The final decision of any words to be appointed by members of the congregation will, of course, bring it by its own members."
The 2017 government law gave Wells the power to change his name.
In June, the commission announced the results of consultations with the public on proposals that suggested great support for the appointment of the parliament as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the name of the members of the assembly, the commission prefers members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the highest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament propose alternative options, but the fight to achieve a consensus can cause headaches for Assembly President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft law on changes within a few weeks.
The Reform Law will include other changes to the way the congregation works, including rules to disqualify members of the congregation and design for the committee system.
The members of the congregation will give the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve the decade dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that her northern neighbour's name is the right to stand on its territory and constantly opposed the country's EU and NATO bids.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of the plebiscitiscitis for changing the name, said he would not take into account the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells shouted while the churches in Harlem face problems
"Historic, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today, there's neither of them."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize in a different way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer living rooms in the neighborhoods where people go regularly."
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the property sale will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place they started."
The churches, he added, could be replaced by housing buildings filled with a type of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings are white people," he said, "and that's why the day these churches will be closed completely because it is unlikely that most people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of blacks – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original congregation of white-methodists moved out in the 30s.
The congregation of black people who practice their faith nearby takes over the property of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the consgregation of black men during the reign of priest John Howard Johnson, who took the boycott of salesmen on 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was very damaged in the fire in 1939, but since the members of the Father Johnson parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carilon.
The priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir in St. Martin, proudly called the carilon “the bells of the poor. ”
The expert who played the carilon in July called it differently: "cultural wealth" and "indefinite historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng, from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carilon in the world to play black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carilon to Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marivetter said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months was a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, a part brought by non-profit leaders of the church, and part of the bishop's ecclesiastical ecclesia.
The church committee – the governing body of the church, consisting of innumerable leaders – wrote to the Eparhia in July with concern that the eparhy "will require transfer of expenses" to the church committee, although the church committee was not involved in the employment of architects and entrepreneurs sent by the eparchia.
Some members of the parish complained about the lack of transparency by the eparchia.
Shark hurt a 13-year-old dive child for lobsters in California
The shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while roaming for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season, the authorized authorities said.
The attack happened seven hours ago near Bicone Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he dive with his friends about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel declared that first he thought it was an excitement of lobster capture, but then “he realized that he was yelling,“ He bit me!
He bit me!
All his key bone was seen," Hamel said he noticed after he got to the boy.
"I have called upon everyone to come out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hamel added.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the children's hospital Works in San Diego, seduced as in critical condition.
You don't know what kind of shark was responsible for the attack.
The savior on the beach, Captain Larry Giles, told the press conference that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but they decided that the shark was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim got traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorized authorities have closed the beach from the ponto beach in Kasablad to Swami in Ensinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noticed that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans enter the beauty market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's taking over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelves of beauty in the style of stock houses filled with professional assistants.
As part of the considerable entry into the United Kingdom market of beauty, which weighs 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow as the sale in the fashion and household declines, large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 shops across the country, and will also be presented in several stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty emerged after supermarkets started looking for ways to use the shelf space used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said that for the first time they would double the beauty offer to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing brands of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also restarts its series of makeups Boutique, so most of the products are suitable for vegans, something that is increasingly required of younger consumers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrant Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury stores, the first opened in Craydon, southern London last week, and the second opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and the tendency of buying smaller food on a daily basis in local shops means supermarkets should do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, the director of Sainsbury's, said the stores would increasingly look like groceries because the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl's discontents with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's started putting Argos shops in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after he bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, increased the sale of groceries and made purchases more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but co-operation ended after disagreement on how to divide profits from supermarkets for chemical assets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold 281 of his pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxurious brands for skin care including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sense of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be available to offer advice.
Our series of brands is designed to match any need, and the attractive environment and the suitable locations mean that we are now mandatory destination for beauty that causes the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "beat" after Holly Willoughby retired from an agreement worth 11 million pounds
The star Peter Jones of Dragons Den left "bearing" after TV leader Holly Willoughby pulled out of an agreement worth 11 million pounds with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their brand Truly for products and household supplements.
The two's business is connected to Gwynett Paltrou's brand.
This 37-year-old head of the morning program said Instagram is leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Dan, retiring from their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "angered" when a television golden girl confessed during a tension meeting Tuesday in his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Bukinghemshire, that her new contracts -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- mean that she no longer has time to dedicate to their brand Truly for products and supplements for household.
The business is linked to the Goop brand of Guinet Paltrou and was said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated 11 million pounds.
As the 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain quickly to one of his cottages.
One source said: “Truly was always top of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be her long - term future that he would send in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all affected caught absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday, was so close to opening.
In Marlow's headquarters, there's a store full of products ready for sale."
Experts believe that leaving this host of the morning programme, which is one of Britain's most paid stars, could cost the company millions because of major investments in cushions and candles and clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
And that can mean an end to a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three children, and husband Dan Boldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% share of Boldwin TV production company.
Willoughby should become an ambassador to the brand for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the leader of "I'm A Celebrity" (I'm the star) of ITV.
The source close to Jones yesterday said "We do not comment on his business movements".
A serious conversation “and then we fell in love ”
He was joking about the criticism he would get from the media for commenting that some would view as "unprecedental" and because he is so positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said with his voice rewritten as "the news presentationer".
"I haven't given up on anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But talks on day-clarification have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly leaders that the North does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States on the early North Korean disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressures.
Trump takes a much more optimistic look at his speech at the rally.
"We agree perfectly with North Korea," he said.
"We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We now have this excellent co-operation."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results -- completed missile trials, helped release hostages, and the remaining US soldiers returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about Kim's relationships.
"It's easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this full arena, we'll have 200 people standing right here," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and took hundreds of lives
In the consequences of the Lomboc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, an elementary disaster was not declared, which is a prerequisite for getting international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr Sumbung said.
Although the “Save the Children ” is forming a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said the Indonesian authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if it would allow international agencies to contribute to their efforts to help.
Because of the earthquakes that constantly hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the anger of nature.
Although shelters were built for tsunamis in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coasts.
The obvious lack of siren warning from tsunami in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling through many islands in Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the place of the new disaster.
The main point in President Yoko Vidodo's electoral campaign was improving the old Indonesian infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds covered Mr. Yoko's administration in the eyes of reelections next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets, using tortures, arrows, and arrows and other old weapons.
Look, Daniel Starjah of the Liverpool team is equal to Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from loss in the Prime Minister League with goals in Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed Starja's ball to about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team was losing 1-0.
He switched the ball to the left before heading to the remote stat.
The ball was moving high above the sixteen as he was turning to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally went through the jumping Capa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shak always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as I could," Stardge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming in and I just touched her and didn't think much about it and just kicked it."
Chelsea took 1 - 0 in half after Belgian Star One Hazard scored goal in 25 minutes.
The attacker of the blues handed the heel back to Mateo Kovacic in that attack, before he kicked the ball nearly halfway to the field, and then sprinted into half of Liverpool.
Quickly, Kovacic and I were in the middle of the field.
He then put a missile, taking Hazard to the sixteen.
Hazard passed the defense and finished in the net of the remote statue with a left leg by Alison Becker on Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Napoli in the group phase of the Championship League on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA League of Europe at 3:00 p.m. in London on Thursday.
The number of Tsunami victims in Indonesia rose to 832
The number of earthquake victims and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were captured in the ruins of buildings that fell into a 7.5 earthquake that hit a Friday and caused 20-foot waves, the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was seized by a shot from the crashed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation was initiated after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merciside.
Forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with Grayson Mows' stab wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked the people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohagen said: "The investigation is in the initial stage, but I would ask those who were near John Street in Birkenhead, who saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially the taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation."
Police spokesman that the woman whose body was found is a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in a facility.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, as the police said, they will inform the close people of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mows just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police told him it was not allowed in or out of the building.
He lost words when he found out what happened.
The tenants now told them that hours will pass before they can return.
Someone heard a cop tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman in tears at the scene.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were in the cordon, and another one was out.
A number of cops were standing in the cordon and watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime fighters on 0800 555 111, quoted a 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of parliament becomes the latest memory strike in a "recording history" fight
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by its fanatic puritanic followers.
Cromwell's Society, however, described Mr. Creek's proposal as "sancy" and "the attempt to overwrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of Cromwell’s Society, said: “In the current statue removal debate, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure before the Westminster Palace would become the goal.
The economist of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the past century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell of Sir William Hamo Thorneicroft is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Mnogs consider, perhaps more in the late years of the 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defense attorney of the foreign pressure parliament, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate performance is the subject of a continuous historic debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and mentioning."
Pig-killer tears apart and kills a Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by the name "Juan", was found dead with the skinned artery, covered in blood near the Liupanshui market in the province of Gitzou, South China, announced Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pig farm pigs on May 30, 2005, in Xining in the province of Kinghai, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door of the next pork squirrel.
He stated that in the brake he was a great breeze with blood on his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that a whip weighing 550 pounds ripped the farmer and killed him, in accordance with the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and broken," said my cousin, named "Wu", according to the quote in Guyang's evening news.
The video from the security camera showed Juan entering the market at 4.40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Juan nor his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig was locked to prevent other people from attacking while the police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market responsible are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rarely, cases of pigs that have attacked people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig clipped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon had been eaten by his pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs were not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood could act as a "activator".
"They're just playing."
They want to bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.
The rest of the hurricane Rosa will bring rain in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, the hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States in the next few days.
Rosa brought winds of 85 mph, a hurricane of category 1 from 5:00 A.M. east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and heads east to the west coast of the United States, as Rosa approaches the Lower East California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm will begin to import a large tropical moisture north into the southwest part of the United States.
Rosa will bring to 10 inches of rain in the parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture with the depression that approaches will create abundant rains in the southeast in the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden floods, flow of ruins and possible land sliding in the desert.
The large tropical moisture will cause rain that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in the parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in part of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The sudden floods are caused by rapid deterioration of the tropical rain.
It is particularly recommended not to walk into the desert when there is a possibility of tropical rain.
The rain may cause canyons to become stormy rivers, and the storm with thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The depression that approaches will bring locally drizzle rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause rivers of ruins and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region since their wet season.
The occasional tropical rains will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early in the morning on Monday, before the rain spreads more late Monday and Tuesday.
The juvie rain will spread to "four angles" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected throughout the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but tropical areas remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
A great example of the dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central parts of the United States on Sunday.
There are almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to rebuild and expand.
Most of the Central and East of the United States are expected to have a warm start of October with high temperatures at 80 degrees from the south planes to the northeast.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our projection for a longer period indicates the possibility of supernatural temperatures for the eastern parts of the United States, until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched an exciting testimony on Thursday by nominated candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the non-exit political situation continued, with speakers who interrupted regular turndown programmes at the last minute of Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, made an agreement with the FBI to conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate's court committee that he was 100% sure that Cavanaugh was pouring her drunk and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100% certain that it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as Nielsen reported, were watching it on Friday.
The company counted the average ratings of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not available immediately for the other networks they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people who look at offices.
To show better, it is an audience with a size similar to the playoff competition in football or the awards of the film academy.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders were strongly attacking Cavanaugh's appointment, led in front of all networks with 5.69 million viewers average during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.2 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in Friday's drama.
Once the Republican office moderately announced that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him as protesters calling on Friday morning while he was trying to enter the elevator for court hearing.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes while he was rebuked, and all of it was live on CNN.
"They stand here before you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, "You have power, and so many women are powerless."
Fleke said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door was closed, that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the judicial committee was scheduled to vote on the Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate for Voting.
But Flake said he would only do it if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the allegations against the nominated next week, which was requested by the minority of Democrats.
Fleke was partly convinced of his conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kunes.
After talking to Kunes, and with several senators then, Fleke made a decision.
Flake's choice had great meaning, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Cavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation on the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" on coastsit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "play politics" with the British future and undermining national interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview right next to her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called "Checkers" plan for Bregzit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the mutual costs is "completely absurd".
Shooting in Wade Simms: Police Arrest Suspect Ditheon Simson for the death of athletes at Louisiana State University
Police arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting by Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Ditheon Simpson was arrested and detained on second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and the police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, WAFB partner said to the CBS.
After they questioned Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The pathologist's parish office of East Baton Rouge announced the preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound in the head to the neck.
Louisiana's state police fugitive unit, the state police criminal lab, South University police, and citizens of the area for assistance they gave in the investigation that led to arrest.
Atletical director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for its "activity in search of justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-footback grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 balls caught after game in the last season.
On Friday morning, coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team was "destroyed" and "in shock" since Sims' death.
"This is what you care about without stopping," the coach said.
Vulcan threw ashes on Mexico City
The elimination of ashes from the Popocatepetle volcano has reached the southern settlements of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans on Sunday not to go towards the volcano after launching activity in the crater and reported 183 emissions of gas and ashes during the 24-hour period.
The center followed more thugs and shakes.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in the settlements of Mexico City, such as Sochimilko.
Geophysians noticed an increased volcano activity located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police Clash With Catalan Separatists Before Anniversary of Independence Voting
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the independence protesters clashed with the police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of separatists retained by police for public order and peace have thrown eggs and color into dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would usually be filled with tourists.
Later on the day, the fights also broke out, and the police used the palms to suppress the fights.
More than a few hours the independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and on the other hand, union protesters shouted " Long to live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received in the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants independence, a year after Madrid characterized the 1 October referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by the separatist catalonians.
Most voters voted for independence, although the turnout was small because of the boycott by people who opposed secession.
According to Catalon authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police violently tried to stop the vote in the region's polls.
Independence groups camped overnight Friday to prevent demonstrations to support national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
Sixty-eight-year-old electrician Narciss Termes, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has the chance of gaining independence.
"Last year we have lived one of our most beautiful moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
While winning a vital, but close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalon independence parties were struggling to keep the dynamic this year with many of their most famous leaders or in their own-elected persecution or in detention waiting for trial for their role in organising the referendum and a subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic, Hoan Puig, filming the police support protest, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more intense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine catalon leaders who are in prison before last year's trial, announced he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we have seen by the Spanish government," he said.

Manga’s hit brought Livingston victory from 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins
Promoted Livingston captured Rangers by signing Stephen Gerard, with his only two losses in 18 matches, as the manager of the club Ibrox.
The hit by Dolly Menga proved to be significant while Gary Holde's side climbed to one level with Hibernian to the second position.
Gerard's side left without a guest victory in the championship this season and will face the Harts leaders next week, behind with eight points.
Before that, Rapid Vienna League will host Rapid Vienna's Rapid League in Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues undefeated in the division during six matches, and coach Holt has not faced defeat since Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingston missed a chance against crude guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead a long time before they scored, and their directness caused many problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through, but he dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only point his efforts away after sliding off the head of Craig Halckett over the goal.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could create problems with their stocks.
And that's exactly how the crucial goal came.
Rangers missed a free blow, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set Menga together, who only touched a goal from the center of the 16th.
By that moment, the Rangers dominated the ownership of the ball, but they couldn't break the defense of the hosts, so the goalie Leeam Kelly did not mostly play.
That scheme continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos was exercising rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to give a goal because of the Rangers' goalie, Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from another set action on Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen spent it all the time and was constantly defended, while two penal requirements – after Halckett was challenged to replace Glenn Middleton and one for a hand-game – were rejected.
"Fenomanal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasder Lamont at BBC Scotland in Tony Macaroni arena
Fenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to overcome expectations on this upper path.
Their style and character of playing barely changed after their return to the top, but a great deal of credit goes to Holt for the way the team galvanized his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halckett was remarkable, managing super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell on standby.
Rangers still lacked inspiration.
As good as they used to be under Gerard's guidance, they are now behind the same standards.
Their last game was weak – only once they managed to open the hosts – and it was a small awareness of the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Kolonja
There were smiles and blue sky on Sunday (September 29th) when Turkish and Germany leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of the controversial visit of President Erdogan to Germany, aimed at improving NATO alliance relations.
They have deteriorated because of problems that include human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Kolonja to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to Turkey's largest population outside Turkey.
Police quoted security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came near to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, many of them Kurds also pledged, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposed protesters reflect the division of a visitor famous as a hero of some German Turks and criticised as an autocracy of others.
Traffic accident on a trip to Deptford: Bikebird died in a car crash
A biker died after a car crash in London.
The collision took place near the street crossroads of Bestuad and Evelyn, a traffic car accident in Deptford, in the southeast of the city in about 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance came, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The crash took place several months after another bikeman died in a car accident on Childers Street, where the driver escaped, about a mile from Saturday.
Metropolitan police say the officers are working on identifying the husband and informing his family.
The roadblocks are placed and the buses are redirected and drivers are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
Six prison police officers were injured in riots in a man's prison with high security levels, the prison office said.
The riots exploded at HMP Long Martin in Warchestshire at approximately 9:30 BST on Sunday and still last.
Special Forces from Tornado unit were brought to resolve riots, including eight prisoners and limited in one wing.
Cops are treated for small injuries at the scene.
Prison spokesman said: "The specially trained prison staff was instructed to deal with the ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and the responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison governor received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police for public order and peace were called into prison to deal with serious riots in which the staff was attacked with balls for pool.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden floods (can be useful for dried areas)
A tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but probably that will happen at the beginning of the next week when the rest of the Hurricane Rosa forces will pass through the desert southwest region, risking sudden floods.
The state meteorological station has already issued warnings about possible sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, up to south and east Nevada, southeast California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and South Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The state meteorological station in Phoenix announced in tweet that only “the ten tropical cyclones kept tropical storm status or depression in the range of 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katherine (1967) was a hurricane in the range of 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in the edge of the Mongolon of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basen, will likely have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated places up to 4 inches of rain.
For those outside the risky areas of sudden floods, Rose's rain may be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although the flood is a very serious problem, part of this rain is likely to be useful because the southwest region is affected by drought.
According to the US Surveillance Authority, nearly 40 per cent of Arizona faces extreme drought, second highest category," weather.com said.
First, the path of the hurricane Rosa led to slopes on earth everywhere on the Peninsula of Lower California in Mexico.
Rosa, still with a hurricane on Sunday morning with winds of maximum 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and heads north with 12 miles an hour.
The storm comes in contact with cold waters in the Pacific and is shrinking.
Therefore, rains in Mexico are expected with a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rains in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected to rain from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to Northwest Sonora, with a maximum of 10 inches of rain," weather.com said.
Rosa will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border at the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and south of Utah until late evenings Tuesday.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or her remains is a lot of heavy rains in Lower California, Southwest Sonora and the desert southwest region of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden floods and flows of ruins, as well as land sliding in mountain regions.
Attack in Midsamer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
Teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsamer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
The police asked if anyone had the cell phone footage of the incident, to step forward.
Trump said Kavano "founded the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The voice for Judge Kavano is a voice for rejecting the most vigorous and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Tramp said at a meeting in Wiling, West Virginia.
Tramp said Kavano "tolerated the greatest malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh witnessed in front of the congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blassi Ford’s accusations that he sexually assaulted her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw the brilliantness, quality and courage" of Kavano that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavano is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an infinite record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Cavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans' turnout in early elections.
"Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and hinder".
The first key vote for Cavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected not later than Friday, the senior GOP director for CNN said.
Hundreds of dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total number of victims increases
At least 384 people died, many were taken from the vast waves that hit the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesian island Sulavesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu on Friday when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the sunset shore, taking many to a safe death and destroying everything on their way.
After the 7.5 earthquake, it hit the tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately, so they became victims," said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman of the BNPB agency for mediating in Indonesia's disasters in a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, drew cars, woods, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through an open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape from the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated at 24 centres in Palu.
Air photographs published by the catastrophe agency have displayed many destroyed buildings and stores, twisted and demolished bridges and a water- surrounded mosque.
The following tremors continued to shake the coastal town on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesia (BPPT) assessment and application agency said the energy released from the massive earthquake Friday was about 200 times the energy released from the nuclear bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographic position of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, could possibly boost the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "scale" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
Some victims' bodies were found stuck under the shot of the crashed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said victims and damage could be greater along the coast of 300km north of Palu, in a area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There live more than 300,000 people," the Red Cross said in an announcement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday that she informed us that tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said waves came about at the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared with social media, a man can be heard on the top floors of the building screaming outrageously, warning people on the street down about the tsunami that approaches.
In a few minutes, the water wall is stumbling on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't confirm the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused an outbreak of electricity that has cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The military began sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to help and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Vidododo planned to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The total number of victims in the tsunami in Indonesia climbed over 800.
It's really bad.
While the World Vision staff of Dongala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees sheltered in shelters in the courtyard of their office, they travelled through the scenes of desert, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as the aid groups began the dark attempts to start aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to come if the site of the disaster was declared a national disaster zone.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "All right, this is a national disaster," we can receive international aid, but there is still no status."
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of the missing people still hoped their loved ones would be the miracles that would facilitate the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was removed from the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors saved a woman who was stuck under the bullet for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state paragling team, trained two of the missing paraglyderists for the Asian games, which ended in early this month in Indonesia.
Others stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the paraglinger field, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told us how, when she began circulating the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel in the community of paraglyderists, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the competitors from Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a grey marker instead of a son.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26.750 when filling a bankomat at "Newport Cay"
The thieves on Friday morning stole $26.750 from an employee at Brink's who supplemented a bankomat at The Newport of the Cay, according to a press statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car driver emptyed the bankomat in the entertainment complex and was preparing to complete it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "run from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses have noticed more suspects fleeing the crime scene, according to a statement, but the police did not give a specific number of persons involved in the incident.
Anyone who has any information about their identity needs to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanje West: Rapper changed his name to J
The Rapper Kanya West changed his name to Yai.
The change published on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The creature once known as Kanya West."
Forty - year - old West wore Yai's nickname for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, published in June.
The change took place just before his visit to Saturday Night Live, where his new album "Yandhi" is expected to be published.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande at the show that had to cancel on "emotive reasons," the showmaker said.
While using it as a shortcut to his current professional name, West earlier said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there means 'you'," West said at the beginning of the year, discussing the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"What means I am you, I am us, it is us.
He left Kanya, which means the only one, to Jeh alone, reflects our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a demonstration of who we are."
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Kombs is known as Puff Dedi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brader Love (Love and Brother Love).
A former West associate, J.Z., also uses his name with or without a cartoon and all the big letters.
AMLO from Mexico promises not to use the military on civilians
Mexican VD President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed he would never use military force against civilians while the country is nearing the 50th anniversary of bloody repressions against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday at Tlatelko Plaza that "will never use the army to repress the Mexican people".
The army shot at peaceful protesters at the square on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people during the time the left-hand student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly assistance to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. needs to double the funding of artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, so the United States should double research funds in the field, the investor and practicer for AI, Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments arrived after various parts of the US government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the United States has no formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: seeking to be number one in artificial intelligence innovations by 2030.
"The merger of the artificial intelligence budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
Doubleing funds can double the odds that the next major achievement in the AI area will make the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The Super Forces in artificial intelligence: China, the Silicon Valley and the New World Order) was issued this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of Sinovation Ventures, who invest in one of the most profound AI companies in China, Face++.
In the '80s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest ranked US Otelo player, and later was director at Microsoft Research and chairman of the Google branch in China.
Lee thanked for the previous matches of US government technology as the challenge in the robotics of the Advanced Defense Research Agency and asked when to be the next match, to help identify the next visionaries.
US researchers often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Li said changes in immigration policy can also help the United States improve their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe "green cards" should be automatically offered to doctors of artificial intelligence science," he said.
China's State Council published its Plan for the development of the future generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Science Foundation finances people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organisations distribute money to US researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defence Ministry established a U.S. Engineering Intelligence Centre, which should cover partners from the industry and the academy, and the White House announced the establishment of an authorized committee for artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion for an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in exploring artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, the US legislation demanding the creation of the National Intelligence Security Commission has not acted for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted Sunday's referendum on whether to change her name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decade dispute with Greece that blocked its membership requirements in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that her northern neighbour's name is the right to lay on its territory and vetoes its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycotting campaign questioned whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 per cent needed for validation at the referendum.
The question of the referendum card was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership by accepting the deal with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the price is worth paying to allow the EU and NATO bodies to enter Macedonia, one of the countries that appeared after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-third majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 13:00 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters gave their vote.
"I went out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjoše Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duško voted in Macedonia's referendum to change the name of the country, which would open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, was preparing a small scene and chairs in front of tents set by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with heads raised high, not from the back entrance," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to receive us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Azian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring very necessary investments to Macedonia, which has more than 20 per cent unemployment rate.
"I believe that the majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said the result of "yes" would be "confirmation of our future".
The poll, released last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is under the necessary turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian Television Thelma, showed that 57 per cent of voters are planning to vote Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent will vote yes.
To make the referendum a success, turnout should be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious impact of the pro-Western government's policy since they came to power in May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has passed the entire defense of Brighton for goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly overwhelmed Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Ethihad stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in 65 minutes.
The Argentineian attacker was given to be placed in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
It went fast between three Brighton defense players, before he entered the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "green".
Surround a defense player before running a few others to the edge of Brighton’s sixteen.
He then passed left of him, to Sterling.
The English assailant used his first arrival to the sixteen to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right leg beat Brighton's goalie, Matthew Ryan, with a single hit on the right side of the network.
"Aguero has leg problems," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked to play 55 - 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky you gave naked at that moment."
But the initial advantage of "the blues in heaven" gave Sterling in the fight for the Prime Minister League.
The goal came in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton's territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before he took Sterling to the remote stat.
The attack on the "heavenly blue" brought the ball into the net before it got into the car.
City will fight Hoffenheim in the Championship League group on Tuesday at the Rhyne-Nekar arena, Germany.
Shercer wants to play a spoiler against Rockis
Since Nashnells were eliminated from the playoff fight, there was no reason to force another start.
But always competitive Shercer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against Colorado Rockis, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rockis team, which lead with a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockis’s team had at least a "joker" for a 5-2-win victory over Nashnels on Friday night, but they are still struggling to determine their position in the first division.
"If we don't play for anything, at least we can throw away knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any moment that I will face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
Nashnells still needs to publish a starter in a week, but they are reportedly inclined to allow Shercer to be thrown into such a situation.
Shercer, who will start for the 34nd time, trained throwing on Thursday and throws normally rested on Sunday.
Washington's right-wing is 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strike-out points in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Mitings for Tramp in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation on his choice of Brett Kavanno to the Supreme Court while talking about the importance of the turnout of the Republicans in early elections.
"All we've done so far will be gambled in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see these terrible, terrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power by using all the means available to them, you see wickedness, rudeness.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to run to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we won't give them."
Democrats, he said, have a mission to "make resistance and hinder".
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "anger, evil, rude and infinite".
He mentioned Senator Diana Fainstein from the Democratic Orders, appointed by the Senate Court Committee, namely, to which the audience reacted with a cry of discouragement.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I wait a little -- it was a very bad body speech -- the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Laborists no longer accept different opinions.
Do not tolerate those who express their opinion
When Currentum's activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last of the parliamentary members of the Laborist Party who are told we are not welcome -- just because he expresses his opinion.
My colleague-partiment Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because he took a determined stand against antisemitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticised me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironicly similar issues Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting of the Eastern Laborist Party of Nottingham stated that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In most of my eight years as a member of the Laborist Party's parliament, council meetings Friday night were just like that.
Sadly today, it is not the tone of most meetings, but the promise of “deserving, gentle ” politics is long forgotten, if indeed, ever began.
It becomes more obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Laborist Party, and any opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to the party’s leaders.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I thought we had previously shared similar political opinions began to expect me to fully change my mind and take positions that I would never have otherwise taken, whether it was national security or the EU's internal care.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there is a critical abuse of social media that calls for conviction, denial of the centre's policies, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Laborist Party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know that I have more happiness than some of my colleagues because the comments focused on me are usually political.
I have great appreciation for professionalism and the determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuses every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the laborist party should practice culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with any request for "no confidence" or change in selection rules, the party becomes with closer opinions.
I have received many advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “all will be well. ”
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Laborist Party as a student, provoked by the carelessness of Thacher's government that literally let my classroom crash, I fought to improve public services for those who needed the most, whether as a local advisor or government minister.
I never hid my policy, including the last elections.
No one in Eastern Nottingham could be confused in no way about my political attitudes and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country is going to force towards the Bregzit to hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But I have one message that is not about Nottingham Current, but for my voters, whether they are members of the Laborist Party or not: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no matter how condemning threats or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will distract me from acting in a way that I find it in the best interest to all of you.

Ear 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ear Goes to Top
The two late points may have changed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear earned the triumph in this wonderful entertainment match on the day of Scotland's Scotland Championship in football.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, everything is due to their superior defense, as well as their improved benefited chances taken by the home team, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested through our matches so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: “A commendation for Ear, they have better taken advantage of their chances than we do. ”
Grant Anderson's point in 14 minutes, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Ear the advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Hughes, given for the Voriors game, enabled Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggot grabbed an unconverted point.
Climo extended Ear’s leadership with a penal, earlier, precisely at half - time, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to reach the Ear 17 - 5 for the rescue.
But Melrose well started the second half, and the point of Patrick Andreson, converted by Bagot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a long retention due to a serious injury by Ruarid Not, who was carried out on a carrier, and from the beginning, Ear continued to struggle with Staford McDowall’s point, converted by Climo.
Ear's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then got a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for an extra man with an unconverted score of Bruce Colvin at the end of the time with ruthless pressure.
But the home team recovered when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow Clima crash card without the ball, McPherson extracted a pointduan from the penal line on the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Klimo converted, as he did almost from the beginning again, after Kyle Row took David Armstrong's blow and sent wing player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.

"The sea is ours": Bolivia surrounded by land hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors are patrolling a cover-up marine headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings set up a sea blue flag.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are glued with the motto: “The sea is our rightly.
It's our duty to return."
Throughground Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost in behalf of Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict of resources is still fresh, as is the longing to re-earning the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may now be the greatest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court on 1 October after five years of debate.
"Bolivia has the moment, the spirit of unity and calmness and of course expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Kalsadia, a bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision made by the International Court of Great Screen all over the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of variable talks, Chile is obligated to negotiate to grant a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here is Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia with native origin, who faces a controversial fight for reelection next year, also depends rather on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will likely not rule in favour of Bolivia and will not change much even to judge in their favour.
The Dutch-based UN body has no power to allocate Chile territory and suggests it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
That the international court's verdict comes only six months after the final arguments indicates the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And for the last four years, they may have reverse the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
"The current bolivian administration has taken advantage of the sea access problem for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales' military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak at a certain point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a bolivian envoy to The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a tremendous opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit," he said.
Calsadia also rejected that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to see that we should overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmment if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep their promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of restarting the blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Yong Un.
Ri says it is a "fiction" to believe that extended sanctions and the United States' objections to the Declaration of the Korean War would bring North Korea to their knees.
Washington is cautious to agree with the declaration without Pjongjang first to take significant disarmament measures.
And Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is a great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim-Tramp's second summit.
Paris fashion magazines reveal the latest line of massive hats that is on the way to the largest stores in your vicinity
If you want to improve the size of your collection of caps or completely block the sun, then don't look further.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown discovered a series of crazy too big hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that blinded the style set on the Modern Week in Paris.
Ultimately unpractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their creations falling into the eye on the runway.
A piece pointed out from Valentino was an enormous beige hat decorated with widespread feathers that overwhelmed the head of the model.
Other too large supplements included circus melons, magical hat, or even ananas, but they were not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation looked like a diving equipment full of glasses and a dive pipe, and the other looked like a meltdown cornet ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Style trackers predict that huge hats can come to the stores near you.
Too big hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the slammed hat with a blast of two feet that all of Riana and Emily Rataykovski carry.
The cool fashion house that stands behind too much inpractical hat that has spread through social media has sent another large creation on the runway, a straw bag of beach size almost equal to the height of the model that he drew.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia brothel and a white leather handle, was the piece that was highlighted in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus' Fashion Week in Paris.
The style of the famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect to see the big hats and bags of the beach in the stores next summer, because the designer has caused so much influence that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many supplements. ”
John Edward: Language skills are necessary for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding results in the exams, which is only strengthened with individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to give their students and parents the best service.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, career chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement adapted school programmes, we see that modern languages remain popular and desired as an electoral object in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, it will make him inclined.
If you speak to him in his language, it will hit him in the soul."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages exceed all other objects with the highest percentage of success in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages have reached a higher score of "5+".
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students reached a higher score of 5+ in mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who learned German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who learned Spanish also scored "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young ones will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an electoral item, are viewed at the same level as STEM items (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programmes, as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the Commission for Employment and Skills of OK in 2014 noted that from the reasons the employers cited for failure in filling jobs, 17 percent were due to lack of language skills.
Consequently, language skills are becoming more obligatory to prepare young people for their future careers.
With increasing jobs looking for languages, these skills are necessary in the globalized world.
No matter what career someone will choose, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such life’s skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polygot before competition.
According to the YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults from OK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over ten percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Consequently, investing in teaching languages is now important for children today.
Having more languages, especially those of economies in development, will provide children with better chances of finding significant employment.
In Scotland, every school will differ according to the languages he teaches.
Several schools will focus on classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important in OK when viewed in the future by 2020 as mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages that can be chosen in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing the environment of learning to prepare children and to arm them with the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future will bring.
At the moment it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this must be changed in schools.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered “international communication skills. ”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
‘Il faut bien le faire’ (that must be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
Lebron will take Lakers to debit in San Diego on Sunday
Waiting almost finished for fans who wanted to see Lebron James start for Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers Coach, Luke Walton, announced that James will play the first game in the Sunday Denver Nagets session in San Diego.
But how many minutes will he play, it is not decided yet.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the official Lakers website.
The Lakers Reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote a tweet that James would probably play a limited time.
After training in early Sunday, James was asked about his six-game schedule plans before Lakers' season.
"I don't need games in the presidential session in this phase of my career to prepare myself," he said.
The Yu-Tube Channel for the Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump started a series of rallys as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of Tramp's five scheduled rallys next week, including visits in favourable places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his choice to fill an empty seat in the Supreme Court is at rest, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, because the Republicans can lose control in the Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's evening rally in West Virginia and how do you see it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., an hour zone on the East Coast tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online live broadcast on You-Tube.
This week, it is likely that Tramp will address the hearing of the man nominated for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh, who has become intense because of the accusations of poor sexual behavior with the expected delay of the Senate vote until a week, as long as the FBI investigation continues.
The primary goal of a series of rallys is to help Republicans get a swing for November elections.
From here, President Tramp's campaign said that these five rally next week are aimed at "inspiring volunteers and supporters because Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many federal states as possible with the beginning of the hard campaign season," a spokesman from Trump's campaign told Reuters, who refused to be appointed.
An appointment at the Wesbanko arena in Willing, tonight's rally could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media", according to the news of Metro of West Virginia.
On Saturday, Tramp's second visit to Western Virginia in the last month, a country in which he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not good for Morrisei that the president must come to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hyder, a politician from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team showed courage in fighting to keep hopes alive at the beginning of individual Sunday matches
After three unilateral seasons, the four on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The diversity of happiness is a fully invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and mostly in such matches.
Who would say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now there are four, so we have little luck," Jordan Spit said after the end of today's competition.
The Europeans have the advantage, of course, of four points and twelve more games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel they have a weak wind in sails even though they have enough incentive, if nothing else then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points in four.
Spit was great and leads with an example.
Those strong shouts of celebration were getting stronger during his game, with a key blow that led to a match of four or four when he and Thomas had two failures after two rounds.
His blow that won the 15-year-old match was welcomed with a similar cry, one that tells you that he believes the American team is not out of play.
"You just have to deepen up and take care of your contest," Spit said.
That's all any player's left now.
18 holes to score.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The odd, but the wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and they can't make a mistake.
Mollywood was the only pair without bad hits on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noise group ensure that they are the players who will win Sunday and there will be no other popular players that will ensure potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf Nasional, except Flitwood or Molinari.
It prefers both in different holes at the same time.
However, talks on European fame remain unjustified.
Bubba Watson and Web Simson quickly dealt with Sergeo Garcia, the morning hero of double couples, when he merged with Alex Norren.
A missed blow and two doubles of the first nine buried the spaniard and the Swedish man in a hole they never got out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Double couples and fours are so fascinating to look close because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give themselves, the advice they do not obey and the way the strategy can change at once.
Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved significant leadership in the last day, but the four season also showed that the US team could fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans lead with 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will enter a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's leadership in double pairs and fours of 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take Le Golf National's lead by four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who fought to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the US team that had many failures in the morning double couples and won the 3-1 series.
The Americans were more resistant in the fours, winning two matches, but they couldn't reach the lead.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points from 12 individual matches a week to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first European rookie to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari, called "Molywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair at all who won four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After "guilting" Woods and Patrick Reed in double couples, they played great and defeated the woods and US rookie Bryson Dechambou with even more express result of 5&4.
Woods who swung through two matches on Saturday, played great in moments, but now lost 19 out of 29 matches in double pairs and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, rested while the morning double couples lasted, returned as Henryk Stanson's partner in the fours with the defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coptic -- ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all for them that pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners, Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, set a measure for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They have won a decisive victory 2&1 over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in double pairs and returned later to beat Pulter and Rory McCalroy with 4&3 in four, but lost the initial, two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a certain team recovered from the lack of four points in individual game, although as the holders of the title, Furik's team had sufficient equal result to maintain the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the weekly counterattack seems to remain above them.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extended sanctions deepened confidence in the United States and that there is no way the country would give up nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Young Ho told the annual World Body General Assembly that North Korea took "significant measures of goodwill" in last year, such as stopping nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear tests facilities and committed against proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea's famous complaints on Washington's resistance to the approach to nuclear disarmament "in phase", according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri acceded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit at all of the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmment of the Korean Peninsula", while Tramp guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea requires a formal end to the Korean war from 1950-53, but the United States claims Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to indulge in strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on "nuclear disarmment above all" and increases the pressure level with sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even oppose "the declaration of end of war," Ri said.
"Perception that sanctions can kneel on our knees is a wasteful dream of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that existing sanctions deepen our confidence."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader highlighted in the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the other side in this nuclear disarming problem was South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmment of the Korean peninsula would not end in such a dead end."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was considerably different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the direction of North Korean missiles to the US land was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Tramp called Kim "a missile" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened with "full destruction" of North Korea last year, much more praised Kim for his courage to take arms steps, but said that there is much to do and that sanctions must remain until the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame on it, saying "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "Sanctions of the Security Council must continue fully and without exceptions until fully confirmed, final nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to hinder the financing of Pyongyang nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly margins, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time it didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress was made, but he was denied from North Korea only after hours because of "gangster demands".
North Korea committed to a meeting with Moon this month for disarming a missile facility, as well as a nuclear complex if the United States take "appropriate measures".
He said Kim told him that "the appropriate measures" he demanded are the security guarantees Tramp gave in Singapore, as well as moves towards normalisation of relations with Washington
Harvard students attend courses to get enough vacation
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all the graduates more sleep in order to fight the growing macho-culture of learning by staying awake all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher discovered that students at the world’s leading university often know nothing about basic concern for themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a medical professor of the dream of the Harvard Medical Faculty and specialist at the Brigam Women's Hospital, designs a course he believes to be the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to begin the course after giving a speech about the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
“ At the end of the lecture, a girl came and said to me, “Why are you telling me this now, in the last year? ”
She said no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits help in academic and athletic results and improve general well-being.
Paul Barrera, a psychiatrist professor at the Harvard Medical Faculty, and executive healthcare director at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a college home where students press coffee cups, curtains, shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic results and the importance of the routine when going to bed.
In other words, participants learn how long - term sleep failure can increase the risk of heart attacks, depression, and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know about the effects on health when you choose to smoke a cigarette," Professor Chaisler added.
The culture of pride with "work all night" still exists, he said, and besides modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, with good quality, it should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid obesity, because the lack of sleep causes the brain to pass into a hunger regime, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Chaisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course in the entire student city.
He hopes the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar programme before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommended that students consider setting up an alarm when to go to bed, and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted from electronic screens and the LED light, which moves the circus rhythm, leading to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga's goal has knocked down Gerard’s people
Rangers suffered another fabulous, sad day when Dolly Menga's hit sent Steven Gerard's rampant team to defeat 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register his first victory after February 4-1 triumph in St. Joneston, but Gary Holt's team installed the second defeat of Gerard's 18 games as a manager who left his team eight points behind the swollen leading team Harts in the Scottish first league.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime, and Rangers' position lost inspiration and chances of alignment.
Now the Rangers fell to the sixth place, and Livingston climbed to the third and just behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after Line Judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for head injury after he was clearly hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that passed Aer in the semifinal of the Bathfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 of Livingstone who won a point with Harts last week and would have been happy in the way his well-trained posture choked opponents at any chance.
Rangers may have dominated the property over the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start of Menga's first play, when Scott Pittman swept to Alan McGregor's goal, but the middle-class player missed his chance.
Then Kyhan Jacobs hit the captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in defense.
Rangers managed to control the game, but it seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos of course felt that he should be given a pen in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawles crashed, but Judge Steven Thompson did not give a sign of approval of the Columbian's appeal.
Rangers managed to score only two shots at the goal in the first half, but the former goalie of Ibrox Liam Kelly didn't swing from Lasana Culibali's head and this Edaria's weak blow.
Although the beginning of the 34th minute of Livingstone may have been contrary to the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved according to their game.
Once again the Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Menga as a simple ending.
Gerard reacted during the halftime when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wing player passed Morelos, but impressive Kelly reacted from his line of blockade.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play the kind of game they enjoyed, while Litgow and Hackett caught many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead to the end of the game, but McGregor was well set up and stopped Jacobs before Litgoe played head by collar.
Replacement of Rangers, Glenn Middleton, had another request for a penal after he hit Jacobs, but Thompson didn't approve again.
Almanah: Gaiger counter inventor
And now one side of our almanac "In Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and we count ... the day that future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Gaiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactiveness, a discovery that led to the creation of a device known as the Gaiger counter.
Since then, it has become the main fortress of science, the Gaiger counter became mainly the stronghold of popular culture, as in the 1950s "The Bells of Colorado", in which these seemingly inconclusive, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What the hell is that? ”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms that release radioactivity into minerals."
Evans: “Speak, it certainly jumps now! ”
Hans Gaiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the sideline cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the sideline cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the contradicted cells as part of treatment
Method includes extraction of immune cells from a patient and their changes to a lab
You can “see ” protein honor in many cancer species and then be returned to your system
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the obsolete cells, the ovarium cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient, their changes in the lab, so that they can “see ” protein honor in many types of cancer called HER2, and then return to the system.
Professor Jay Berzofski, from the American National Institute for Cancer of Betezda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a vaccine that promises much. ”
HER2 “induces growth of several cancer species, including breast cancer, ovarium, lungs, and colonectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofski.
Similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and their “teaching ” as to target cancer cells function in treating a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-tramp fall, wearing a drop with his motto, after a show on Saturday night live.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the live studio on Saturday night, after a useless performance praised by US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called the City of Spirits, in which he wore a cap with an inscription to make America famous again, he began to criticize the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
“ Often when I talk to a white man, they say, “How can you like Trump, he is a racist? ”
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America long ago," he said.
Saturday's, evening show started live with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked with the testimony of Bret Cavanaugh before the Senate's legal commission, related to the charges of a sexual assault on Christine Blacey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the footage of West's fallout was posted in social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time passing behind the scene because of his cap.
"Behind the scene, they mocked me.
They said, “Don’t show up with that cap. ”
They made fun of me!
Then they told me that I was in the sinking place, he said, according to Washington Exeminer.
News continued: “You want to see the sank place?” He said he would "set his superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try with love."
His comments attracted disrespect from the audience at least twice, and the evening show team seemed embarrassed, Varayetti reported, a man said to the publisher: “The whole studio we know. ”
West was brought as a replacement at the last moment for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Raper McMiller died a few days ago.
West surprised many by performing the song "I want it", dressed like a bottle of Perier.
West received support from the leader of the TPSAD conservative group, Candace Turner, who wrote to Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for putting herself in the crowd. ”
But the host of Karen Hunter's show wrote to Twitter that West "was his own and that's absolutely wonderful".
"But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "artitude") which I believe is accepting and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced Twitter that he had changed his name, and he is now “formally known as Caine West. ”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow Deedy's steps, also known as Puff Daddy, Paff and P.D.
The rapper colleague, Snoop Dog, has the name Snoop Lyon and, of course, the deceased music legend Prince, has changed his name to a symbol, and then in an artist known as Prince.

The Star of the Throne Game, Keith Harrington, attacked the toxic male
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman like John Snow in a violent, medieval, fantastic series of the Throne Games.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype, when he said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they must be strong to be respected.
In a statement about Sandey Times' culture section, Keith said he believes that "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic maleity in #Now I'm saying.
Keith, who recently married the Star of the Throne Game, Rosie Leslie, also admitted to having "powerful feelings" on that issue.
"Personally I have strong feelings, at the moment -- where have we sinned with maleness?," he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, about the problems we see now?"
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the growth of toxic maleity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is congenital and what is taught?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of maleity?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
'Cause it's obvious there's something wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the Continuation of the Throne Game when the series ends next summer, saying he "ends battles and horses".
Since November, Keith will perform in the reconstruction of the True West of Sam Shepherd, a story of a film producer and his brother as a thief.
The actor recently discovered that he thought that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the Throne Game.
"I met my wife in this series, so in a way she gave me the future family and my life in the future," he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love attraction with Keith's image, John Snow, in a fantastic show that won Amy's prizes.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported 14% increase in new cases
China announced a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and Side.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new events were passed through sex, a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who had HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in the Yunan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000 people.
Transferring HIV through sex is an acute issue to the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminated in China in 1997, but the discrimination of LGBT people is great.
Because of the country's conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the China government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data made by a staff member associated with a senator of the Republican Party as "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
US Representative Maxine Waters dismissed on Saturday the allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles assured that the claims were "ultra-right" sympathetics and web sites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hetch from Utah.
Information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, published by an unknown person in Capitol Hill while the Senate's panel for questioning was held on charges of sexual offence against Brett Cavanaugh, nominated for a Supreme Court judge.
The information was reported shortly after Cavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative locations such as Gateway Pandit and Redstate reported that the IP address that identified the source of the announcement is linked to Waters' office and information about a member of the Waters staff has been published, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and represent an absolute lie," said Waters.
"The member of my staff -- whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these false and false accusations -- in no way is responsible for the information provided.
The unhappy accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie."
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flajsher.
"These denials are nervous," wrote Flajsher.
"This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he must not be angry.
He can't be challenged.
He mustn't wonder about the motives of the defendant.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the criticisms of Democrats related to Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of critics because he seemed too angry during the hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the middle of the mandate's elections, also advertised on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big thing," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office informed "the competent institutions and police about false claims.
"We will allow criminals to be disclosed," she continued, "and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff."
The thought of Johnny English attacks again - undermining Rowan Atkinson's spy fraud
Now it is traditional to look for the elements of Bregzit in every new British-link movie, and it seems to be true for this rebuilding of the franchise of the cheating, action comedy Johnny English -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: reborn.
Is careful self - ridicule on how obvious we are will be the new possibility of exporting the nation?
Despite all, the person with large eyes and many faces of the incompetent Johnny English got a license to "fry" things for the second time -- his name above all indicates that he is a comical creation with a wide range, made for movie viewers in places where you do not speak English.
He's certainly a sketch of a secret agent who despite his bizarre efforts to be careful glamour in a bit like Clouseau, there are lines of Mr. Bean and a part of the boy who plays one note from the Kochie song from the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London 2012.
His foundation is the traveler and the mysterious international man Atkinson who used to perform in now forgotten Barcliss TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in Johnny English's latest edition.
I liked it so much when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor, and the rotator's wigs hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy can be seen, but humor seems weak and somehow superficial, especially because "serious" film brands such as 007 and the impossible mission itself contain comedy elements.
Humor seems to be intended for children instead of adults, and to me, Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as inventive and focused as the German tricks on the face of Bin of Atkinson.
The theme that goes through the whole time is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber-hacker infiltrated the super secret spy network in Britain, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, disappointing the agent on duty -- a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompezous and combat figure and already suffers from completely melting political inpopularity: Emma Thompson gives everything of herself in this character of quizi-Tereza-May, but there is nothing special in the scenario that would work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that because every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling himself Johnny English who now works as a private school teacher, but "in black" gives hours for secret agents: there are a few good boys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like rock academy.
England has been quickly invited to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former co-worker Bow, who played Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comic role that Vicky Pepperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all the things in the Royal Secret Service are back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, denominated by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their gossea of absurd actions: remodeled as waiters they burn a French restaurant; they make a waste after smuggling themselves on Walta's luxury yacht; and English starts a real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for virtual reality to know the inside of Walta's house.
All brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and loud as it is, there are a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I can't think of it: can't the British film industry dedicate the role of Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Labourists deny that they make a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party will consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week -- but they will be paid in five.
The party reportedly wants company heads to use the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The employees would enjoy a three-day weekend -- but they would take the same salary.
According to sources, the idea "responses" with the party's economic agenda and plans for the country to be favored by workers.
The four-day work week shift is supported by the union Congress as a way of making workers benefit from economic change.
A highly ranked party member told Sandey Times: “The revision of the strategy should be published before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a pursuit that is in line with the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of workers, as well as the entire party's industrial strategy."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party advocated for a four-day working week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration is not accepted by the entire labourist party.
Labour Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not a party strategy and the party does not consider such an idea."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used Labour's last week's conference to present his vision of the socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to grasp the power of "the directors without a face" and "profits" in the municipal companies.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water supply companies may not get the whole part back because the Labourist government could make "deductions" due to unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of the company's boards and create Inclusive Property Funds with which 10% of private companies' capital will belong to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy are making a statement about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI investigation for Cavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavano delayed the final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the question of whether the discoveries of the bureau can reconsider some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview published on Sunday, correspondent of the 60-minute Scott Pellie asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague than South Carolina.
"I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocable."
Graham's voice, however, looks like a stoned stone.
"My decision has been made for Bret Kavano and a shocking indictment is needed," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret denied it vigorously," Graham added, referring to Christine Blacey Ford.
"All that she has appointed have not been able to confirm.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new to change."
What is the Global Citizen festival and did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be held the Global Citizen festival, an annual music event that features famous stars and has an impressive mission; the end of poverty.
It is now held for the seventh time, and the Global Citizen festival will visit tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the extension of the global poverty project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (even if they don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), participants must fulfil several tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, sending a email message to a world leader, a telephone call or another useful work that will help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful is the Golbal citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to seek to take something or just another case of "click-activism" -- people who feel they're making a real difference by signing a petition on the Internet or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, a Global Citizen has claimed that they have registered more than 19 million "activities" from supporters who have acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped encourage world leaders to accommodate commitment and strategies that have collected more than $37 billion and will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and indications resulting from their activities, of which 10 billion dollars have already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds collected have a direct influence of nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key promises are the Power of Food, the Partnership of Investors and Implementators, with a headquarters in Britain, dedicated to "helping the children to exploit their potential", which promised to provide $35m for Ruanda to help with lack of food in the country after receiving 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of food, a note in history," Ambassador Tracy Ulman from the Power of Food, told the gathered people at the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities have been undertaken related to calls for improving mothers and children's diet in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, the Power of Food, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the often asked questions to their website, "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult journey — we will never succeed.
But like the big civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we're gonna make it because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Mona are some of the artists who will perform this year in New York, whose host will be Debora-Li Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
America can use the Navy to "blocade" to hinder Russian energy export -- the Interior Ministry
Washington can "if necessary" use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinky, as Washington Exemminer quoted as saying.
According to Zinki, Russian involvement in Syria -- namely, where he acts at an invitation to a legitimate government -- is a cover for researching new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy shopping, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he reportedly said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States have the ability, with our navy, to ensure that marine roads remain open and if it is necessary with blockade to prevent their energy from reaching the market," he said.
Zinki addressed the participants at an event organised by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group representing himself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it was effectively the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is, more or less, to raise the stakes and replace the fuels," he said, while talking about Russia as a "one unpleasant pony" with an economy depending on fossil fuels.
The statement came after Trump's administration launched a mission to boost exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials from Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to step away from the "inadequate" project of North Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "container" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline worth 11 billion dollars should double the current capacity of the 110 billion cubic meters pipeline is only an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude encountered resistance from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kemf, the first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "will consider carefully" whether to run for president in 2020, said the senator from Massachusetts
The senator from Massachusec, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday that she "will consider carefully" whether to run for president after the middle of the mandate elections.
During a meeting in the town congregation in Holliok, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our unfunctional government, which means a woman on the forehead," she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president."
Warren assessed President Donald Trump's work during a meeting in the town hall and said he " led the state in the wrong direction.
"I am too worried about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was open in her criticism for Trump and the man he nominated for Judge at the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a Twitter message Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that many voters in its electoral unit think it should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "possibly" voters from Massachusec said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the Centre for Political Research at the University of Safolk/Bostonski Globus.
Thirty-two percent support that kind of bid.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting potential nomination, and 48 percent opposed.
Other known names from the Democratic Party to discuss nomination in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden said he would officially decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin talks about Treck Paylin's more traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump's rally
Treck Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
He was arrested and accused of an incident on domestic violence Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he returned, I know how the other families that are torn apart because of the straumatic syndrome and the wounds with which our soldiers return," she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paylin called the arrest "elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "they return a little different, they return tight, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what they and their Air Force buddies gave for the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Alaska and indicted for domestic violence by attacking a female person, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of alcoholic weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman of the police in Vasila.
18 Allied Countries, Washington City Supports Dispute New Asylum Policy
Eighteen federal states and the city of Washington support the challenge of the new U.S. policy that prevents giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and Washington City submitted petition to the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington as support of a asylum seeker who challenges politics, the NBC News reported.
The whole name of the prosecutor in the Grace case against the Parliament, which the US Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal politics, has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but the US authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was locked up in Texas.
The state defender who represents Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum requests in the United States originate as nations with constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new American asylum policy undos the decision of the Committee on Immigrant complaints from 2014 that allowed non-Documented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington Public Prosecutor Carl Rasin said Friday that the new policy "ignores decades from the adoption of federal states' laws, federal and international levels".
"Federal law requires all asylum requirements to be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request and such a provision violates that principle," according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter claim that the immigrants' policies prevent entry are harmful to the US economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labour force".
Public Prosecutor Jeff Seshnes ordered immigration judges not to give asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or membership in a certain social group or political opinion," Seshnes said when representing politics on June 11th.
Azil has never been conceived as a solution to all problems -- even all serious problems -- with which people around the world face every day.
Desperate efforts to save in Palu because the number of victims doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while comforting her male baby at the evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
There's no clean water."
The inhabitants return to their ruined homes and choose from their listed objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who had fractures on his back and shoulder, rested in front of the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside because of frequent consecutive smaller earthquakes.
The tears came into his eyes when he described the strong earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed in the ruins of the wall, so I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard the wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "maltretating" with "propagand ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page commercial in the US daily citing the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the US Ambassador to China accused Beijing of using US media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump spoke last Wednesday about the paid addition of Tsajna Daily to De Moin Registrar -- the most sold newspaper in Iowa -- after accusing China of interfering in the US elections for the November 6th Congress, China rejected the accusation.
The indictment of Tramp that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US elections marked the US Reuters services, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to press China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington, they are currently in a trade war in which they balance import tariffs to each other.
China's vengeance tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were aimed at exporters from federal states such as Iowa, who support the Tramp Republican Party, Chinese and US experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and the former, long-term Iowa governor, the main exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing hurts US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in De Moine's Sunday edition, "now doubles the abuse with propaganda ads in our free press."
"In the decade of propaganda, the government of China abuses the cultivated American tradition of free speech and free media by putting ads in de Moin register," Branstad wrote.
"Our opposite, in the nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see the real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, because the media are controlled by the firm hand of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most read newspapers refused his announcement offer" to the column, although he did not say which newspaper it is.
Republicans move away from women's votes before elections in the middle of the mandate due to the Kavano debacle, analysts warn
Since many Republicans nemo observe or defend Brett Cavanaugh's nomination in the Supreme Court despite several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially women in the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate.
Emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already declared themselves wanting to continue the vote.
Of such things there is no turning back, "written by Grant Richer, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Reheer said he suspected that the pressure of the FBI to investigate Senator Jeff Flake will be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson of the Modeon Progressive Group on Friday, in front of the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November coming!" protesting in the Senate hall, when the Republicans, who have control in the legal issues committee, decided to continue the nomination of Cavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-party political analyst for the news site.
"People already say they are tall; that is true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, underlined its allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court judge candidate, analysts suggest that there may be negative consequences if the Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steel's former president of the Republican National Committee earlier last week, according to the news of the En-BBC.
"It is not only about the vote in the commission or the last vote or whether Kavano will go to the hearing, it is also about the way the Republicans dealt with this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities, a group that helps in choosing democracy, the news channel.
However, the Americans are divided about who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh’s testimony, even though most accept the first page.
A new Yu-Gov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said that they definitely or probably trust Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent stated that they thought that Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same thing about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the charges made by Ford, as well as at least one more, to Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified in front of the Senate's legal commission, under oath last week that Kavano was drunken on her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez accuses the candidate for Judge at the Supreme Court to show her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Network inventor plans to start a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Network begins with a startup business that pretends to be a competitor on Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that was built on the open-end platform of Solid, at Berners-Li.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Li joked that Inrupt's intention was "the world domination".
"We must do it now," he told the start-up business.
"It is now the historic moment."
The application uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own "soft data clause" or shorter POD.
It can contain contact lists, calendar lists, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Autluc, Slec and Spotifay all available to a viewer at the same time.
What is unique about the personal data storage on the Internet is that only the user depends on who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it "personal strengthening through data".
Inrapt's idea, according to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, is the company to provide resources, process and adequate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Li, Bruce, a security platform purchased from IBM, several developers with a project deal and a community of encoding volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers across the world can create their decentralised applications using tools available at Inrapt's website.
Berners-Li said he and his team did not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a full change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
"We do not ask their permission."
In a announcement by the Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to enable commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet by establishing the Consortium of the World Network of the Institute for Technology in Massachusec.
Recently, Berners-Li is an influential spokesman in the debate on the neutrality of the Internet.
Even at the beginning of Inrapt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Institute for Open Data.
"I am a great optimist about the new era of the Internet," Berners-Li added.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross bearer since World War I
The only priest of the English church who won the Victorian cross during the World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, honored Bernard Van, received the confession on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Belengliz and Lehaukur.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received the highest British military award.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren on a parade in Rashden, Northtonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "a remarkable symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazeta, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "With very dense fog and under a strong fire of guns and machine guns".
He later ran to the places where he was shot and led with “the greatest courage ” ahead, before he attacked the cannon nest himself and disabled three of the service providers.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I will never be able to fill, but it is something that makes us modest. ”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Youth Imperial Band of Brentwood.
Michael Van said "it is a great honor to be part of the parade" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown with the support that will be given by many people".
The fans of combined fighting skills stayed awake all night to watch Belator 206, instead won Pepa Pisse
Imagine, you've been up all night to watch Belator 206, and you don't have the chance to watch the main event.
San Jose's list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card displayed live all night in Britain at Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just that Gerard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face it, British viewers remained intimidated when the channel moved to Pepa Pisse.
Some were not impressed since they stayed awake until early hours due to the fight.
One of Twitter's fans described the transfer of a child's cartoon film as "a sick joke".
"The law is that at 6 in the morning that content was inappropriate, so they had to be transferred to a child's program," said Dave Schwarz, vice president of the Belator for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the transfer.
‘Pepa pig, yes’
The president of the Belator Scott Cooker company said they would work on a schedule to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I'm thinking about releasing, I think we might probably find a solution," Cooker said.
"But there is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, we got a lot of messages when we moved, and none of them were favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't, it was a legal question.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We'll limit the number of five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we tried to deliver more because of fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a desert island: Tom Daily felt "inferior" because of sexuality
The Olympic jumper Tom Daily says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality -- but that motivated him to be successful.
24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to high school that "all aren't like me"
Speaking on the first Discove show on a deserted island on Radio 4, presented by Lauren Lavern, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others a "nade".
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presentation of the long-term Kirsty Young show took a month off because of the disease.
By appearing as a comparative character in Lavern's first program, Daily said he felt "less" than anyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of lower value and diversity were the things that gave me power and strength to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two bronze medal Olympics became a famous supporter of LGBT campaigns and used its performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy that he could live freely without divide and wished to give “hope ” to others.
The three-fold world champion said about falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 -- " surprise me".
Daily married the Oscar, who was 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so many early years," he went to the first 14-year-old Olympic, and his father died from cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age who experienced similar heights and depths.
Both became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily said "all his views" changed.
"If you asked me last year, everything was related to "I should win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son carries his father Robert, who died in 2011, 40 years of age, after his brain cancer was diagnosed.
Daily said that his father did not accept death, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 -- because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't be here to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
Next year Daily competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this is what I've dreamed of all my life -- to jump in front of a domestic audience in the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first choice of a song -- a pride from Heather Small -- that turned into his head during the preparations for the Olympics, and he was still getting his weight on.
Discs on a deserted island on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday at 11:15 British summer time.
Michelson, he's out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays at the 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to change the shape to avoid an unhappy turning.
Michelson, who played the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furik during Saturday's double couples and fours.
Rather than being in the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the five-fold winner, he shared the time to cheer and practice his game, on the scale, in hope of repairing what is depleted.
He was never the best leader, even at the top of his career, a 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow playground Le Golf Nasional, where the distant rough blows are a regular punishment in unawareness.
And if the field itself is not intimidating enough, Michelson, in the 9th Sunday contest, faces the precise champion of British Open Francisco Molinari, who plays in pairs with rookie Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lack four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, Michelson's game can be crucial.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on his back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the famous and has given many for these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it went on and we thought we had to do it.
He likes to play, like everyone else."
Michelson will pass Nick Faldo's best game record at Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of the Ryder Cup career where he never reached the best results of his individual career.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 lost matches and seven halfs, although Furik said his presence brings something unnatural to the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, intelligent, he likes to joke with people and he's a great man at team meetings," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun in the game with him, as well as this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the Great Leader may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, from experience, knows that considerable leadership ahead of individual matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup could easily turn into an impertinent position.
The Danish debited at a Volderam contest in 1997, when the guy headed by Steve Ballesteros had five points ahead of the Americans, but "they crossed the target line only with noses", with the slightest guidance of 141/2-131.2.
"I remind myself that we had a great leadership in Valderama; we had a great leadership in Brooklyn, when we lost in Valderama, when we won for a little," Bjorn, a picture, said after watching the 2018 class win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with Le Golf Nasional's 10-6 leadership.
Well, history will show me and everyone in the team that this isn't over.
Go ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play right.
This is not over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy and focus remains on it.
All the time I'm saying, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're fully aware of the opposing side -- the best players in the world."
Bjorn added the results of his golf players: “I don’t want to give premature reviews on that issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
Tomorrow we are expected by individual games, which is a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then all your skills are tested as a golf player.
It's a message to send to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he should do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furik will ask players to play better individually than they played in couples, exceptions are Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three points in four.
Furik himself was at the end of the last day's changes, because he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina"
"I remember every word there," he said when he was asked about how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, united the players last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start as at the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the moment goes in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We set the line properly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task to oppose first and face Rory McClerroy's most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I decided to perform this way with the boys because I think we'll cover everything like that," Bjorn said about the choice in individual games.
New German military ship has been postponed again
The newest fregate of the German Navy was to be delivered in 2014 to replace old-fashioned warships from the Cold War time, but it will not happen until the next year because of the wrong systems and the rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of Ryneland-Faltz, the leading ship from the new class of fregati Baden-Witemberg, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the daily DiCyte, calling an army spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014 but troubled questions after delivery hindered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Witemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 will be a replacement for the aged bremen fregates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as a stelt-technology, such as a reduced radar, infrared and acute trace.
Among other important features is rarer maintenance -- the latest fregates, should be absent up to two years from domestic ports.
However, constant delays mean that modern warships -- which should enable Germany to have power through the oceans -- will already be aged until they enter the service, DiCyte notes.
The fregate with unhappy fate F125 reached the front pages last year, when the German navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Bloom and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
It is little known about the reasons for the return, but German media quoted a number of key "software and hardware defects" that led the warship to be useless if it was sent to a battle mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Witemberg class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half the crew of the older bremen fregates.
It also turned out that the ship is drastic over the planned weight that reduces its performance and restricts the navy’s ability to add upgrades in the future.
Ryneland-Faltz weighs 7,000 tonnes and is believed to be twice as difficult as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problem hardware, the price of the whole project -- including the training of the crew -- has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) -- an increase from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest fregates are particularly important because of the warnings of Germany's reduced maritime forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem has deteriorated over time, because old ships are withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships are provided.
He complained that none of the fregates from the Baden-Witemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Records the Secret Life of Bats
A new research of property is being conducted in the Scottish hills in order to discover how bats use the area in search of food.
There is hope that discoveries will give answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help in carrying out protection activities in the future.
The study of the National Trust scientists for Scotland will follow the ordinary and soprano bats, as well as the brown bats with long ears and daubenton bats in Inveru Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on key locations around the property to monitor bat activities during the season.
Ann-Eich-S and volunteers will also carry mobile research using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of sound from all the videos will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
Then a habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Devar, a Nature Protection Advisor in En-Ti-Es, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of living are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These information will help to determine the benefits of managing the habitats, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain the forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has significantly decreased in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect the beds and the loss of habitats.
The windmills and lights are also a risk, as well as the sticky fly tapes and some chemical treatments on construction materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The bats aren't actually blind.
Yet, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
En-T-Es, who cares about more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspections on beds, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even sets up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on Triv's property in Dumfris and Galovei, a home to eight of the ten species living in Scotland.
The property manager David Thompson says the property is an ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Triv," he said.
"We have old buildings, very old two and very good habitats.
But there are many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us find out more about what they need to make progress."
He emphasizes it is important to verify whether there are bats before renovating property because unconscious destruction of beds can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrrell, a Scottish official in the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: “We still need much to learn about bats and other species, we simply don’t know how they live. ”
Ronaldo drops rape charges, lawyers prosecute German magazine
Christian Ronaldo called the rape charges "fake news", and added that people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spigel, which announced the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Majorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently, he paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spigel said on Friday.
Speaking live on Instagram on his 142 million followers, several hours after the charges were made, Ronaldo 33, rejected reports as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was made today is false news," the five-fold goldball conqueror told his camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous with mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," the player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spigel for allegations, which they called "inadmissible transfer of doubts from private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the player would seek damage due to "moral damage in addition to the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
Apparently, the incident on charges took place in June 2009 in a hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clarke Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "good boy," but dropped under that "one percentage".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but there was a consent.
Majorga also claimed that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to a bargaining agreement because she was afraid of vengeance, and she was concerned that she would "be publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old says it now demands a change of contract because there are traumas from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid of Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and moved to Italian giant Juventus this summer with a 100m-euro deal.
Bregzit: Britain "will always regret" that car manufacturers lost
Britain "will always regret" if she lost the status of a world leader in car production after Bregzit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "concerting" that Tojota-Brititania has announced to the BBC, that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnastone factory, close to Derbi.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
Japan's car manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of Bregzit without an agreement would cost jobs.
The Burnastone factory -- produced by Toyota Auris and Avensis -- produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a stop of production in our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's administrative director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concern about how leaving the EU without an agreement will operate cross-border trade, including Honda, Be-Em-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-Em-We, for example, says he's going to close his mini factory in Oxford a month after Bregzit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call risk on the logistical chain in the case of Bregzit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line works according to the system "precisely on time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes of suppliers in Britain and the EU, for cars according to orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there may be an end to the border that, according to the industry, could cause delays and shortcomings in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory supply in the Derbishire factory, the company said, so the production will stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely made to avoid such border checks".
"We should have an agreement. We should have the best agreement that will allow us not only success in the present, but to grasp this opportunity," he told today's Radio 4 programme on BBC.
"The evidence not only from Toyota, but also by other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistical chains."
Toyota couldn't tell how long the production would have been stopped, but long-term warning that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Tswalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is a representative of the factory union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
Tramp's meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again by the White House
Donald Tramp's important meeting with Deputy Public Advocate Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred by another week" because the fight over Brett Kavano's nomination continues for a judge at the Supreme Court, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Muller, who explores Russian mixing in the elections, links between Tramp's assistants and Russia and potential violations of the president's laws.
Will Trump fire Deputy Public Prosecutor and thus jeopardize Miller's independence, fostering rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, New York Times said Rosenstein was considering carrying a recording device with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, by publishing reports last Monday, he went to the White House in order to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the time in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said "I wouldn't like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed in order to avoid a conflict in the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford.
On Friday, Tramp issued an order to conduct a one-week investigation by the FBI on charges against Cavanaugh, which would further delay the vote in the Senate.
Tramp Sarah Sanders' press secretary showed up at Fox News Sunday.
At the question of the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for the meeting is not yet established, it could be held this week, and it could also be postponed for another week, considering all the things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we will see how things are going and I always try to get the press properly informed."
Some journalists argue: Sanders has not held a briefing for journalists at the White House since 10 September.
Leader Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to the dissolution of the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Tramp and the media will increase.
"The president has organised more sessions of questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding without stating evidence: "We have reviewed those figures."
There will still be briefs, Sanders said, "If the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often and you're witnesses that we've been doing it over the last few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace the briefings for journalists."
Tramp regularly responds to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or press conferences visiting senior officials.
Rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why it is so with his uncontrolled and sometimes bizarre appearance before the gathered journalists.
Health Secretary with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system on fears related to Bregzit
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers employed in the national health system of Scotland expressing the country's gratitude and the desire for them to stay after Bregzit.
Jean Freeman, a MP in the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the United Kingdom retreated from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of resolved EU citizens' status applications working in public services at a lower level.
Mrs Freeman wrote in her letter: "The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU for Retreat continued during the summer, in order to make the expected decisions this autumn.
But the United Kingdom government also intensified preparations for the possibility of not reaching an agreement.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of every member of the working staff, regardless of his citizenship.
Co-workers from all over the EU and wider share precious experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services work and are of useful value for patients and communities that we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombi under emergency surgery after he suffered head injury
Cristion Abercrombi, the defensive player (linebacker) of Tennessee State Tigers was under arrest after he suffered a head injury on Saturday when the team lost 31-27 of Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's chief coach, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the semi-time.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just struck on the ground," Reed said.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put it in a stretcher and took him to further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from the WSMV in Neschville, Tennessee that Abercromby had left surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information about the type/degree of injury" and "Tennessee State" is trying to find out when the injury actually happened.
Abekrombi is a student in the second year and plays his first season in red dress in Tennessee State after transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five crashes on Saturday before he got out of the game, resulting in a total of 18 crashes this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when buying property in the United Kingdom
According to Tori's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people
The move will neutralize Corbin's success in attempting to attract young voters
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The ministry expects the move to raise up up to 120m pounds a year, funds to be used to help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the United Kingdom, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be considered an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's success in attempting to attract young voters with its promises to provide accessible housing and focus on high earnings people.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to strengthen government efforts to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for the second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up up to 120m pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London were purchased by non-United Kingdom residents, which led to price increases and caused difficulties for persons buying property for the first time to be included in this housing purchase process.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "towns of spirits" due to a large number of foreign buyers that spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was published only weeks after Boris Johnson asked to reduce the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of offering high prices for property retaining land, but did not use it and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for access homes in order to correct the "shameful situation of housing" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and ending migration for no reason.
He also wants advice to give greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my premiere to the return of the British dream, or that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for those who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as the valuable British residents.
The dream of owning your own home for many people has become too far away, and the humiliation of homeless persons is too real."
Jack Ross: “My final ambition is to run Scotland. ”
Jack Ross, Sunderland's head, said his "end-ambition" was in the future to become the head of the Scottish national club.
The 42-year-old Scotlandian enjoys the challenge of reviving the club of the northeast, which is currently third in the first league with only three points less than the club on top.
This summer he moved to the "St. Mirren Stadium" after returning the "St. Mirren" back to the Scottish League Prime Minister last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B hat and that was it," Ross told the Scottish Sportsound of the BBC.
"But I grew up watching Scotland constantly in Hampden with my father and always something dragged me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be gained if I were successful in the management of the club."
Some of Ross' predecessors as the manager of Sunderland are Dick Advocaate, David Moyes, Sam Alardiche, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Cannio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel any distress knowing that he should follow such established names in such a large club, after earlier rejected offers from "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
"My success at the moment is assessed with "can I return this club to the Prime Minister League?"
Given the structure and objects in this club, it undoubtedly belongs to the Prime Minister of the League," he said.
"It is not an easy task for this club to get there, but I will probably think I have achieved success here only if I bring the club back there."
Ross has only worked as a manager for three years, in which his career has entered since working as a assistant to the Dumbarton chief and after a 15-month engagement as part of the Hearts coach staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the fall in the third league and returned St. Mirren from the edge of losing the title at the Championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played at "Clyde", "Hartlepool", "Falkirk", "St. Mirren" and "Hamilton Academical".
"It was probably a real crossroads for me," he recalls at taking over Alloa.
"I honestly believed that career as manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, making enough of it and enjoying certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on Sunday.
I'm still going through certain things in the sense of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in the role of a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my whole adult life."

According to one study, perfect beer time is 5:30 on Saturday
The summer heat wave led to an increase in the profits of British pubs currently in a very difficult situation, but imposed more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 per cent increase in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA for business consulting services in determining these figures said: "The solar time and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to the one in June, when the profit of the pubs grew by 2.8 percent, and the restaurants were significantly reduced.
The 1.8 per cent reduction in restaurants in June has worsened during July.
The pubs and bars that mostly sell drinks have seen a much higher rise compared to previous years compared to restaurants where declining was observed.
The pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the solar periods, although not as dramatic as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 percent over the month, and the sale of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, an analyst for vacation and hospitality from the RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
Time and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside.
It is no surprise at all that restaurants continue to be in a difficult situation, although the decline in the sale of 4.8 per cent over a year will be particularly devastating as the addition of current pressures that create costs.
The long warm summer could not come at a worse time for local owners in which food is mostly sold and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide the needed breath."
The overall increase in the sale in pubs and restaurants, including the newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the delay in publishing new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker's selling device in the department of pubs, bars and restaurants in the United Kingdom collects and analyses data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups with combined revenue of more than 9 billion pounds and represents a fixed rapper for the industry.
One in five children has a secret profile of social media that hides from their parents
One study showed that one of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, has a secret profile of social media that hides from their parents and teachers
Study involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "fake Instagram" profiles
News has increased the fear that such profiles are published in sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" profile to show their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, creates a social media profile that hides from adults.
The study involving 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" profiles, a shortcut for the Instagram website where photographs are being shared.
News has increased the fear that such profiles are published in sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a cleaned-up "main" profile shown to their parents, and they also have other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13 - year - old daughter’s secret profile of her teenager encountered a teenager who asks others to “rape him. ”
The research conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools has shown that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them acknowledge that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elide Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" of the Scottish Athletics board
Elid Doyle was elected the unexecutable director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most distinguished athlete in Scotland and President Ian Bitti described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport's leadership to exploit its widespread experience at international level gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletic community has a huge respect for Elide and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would have great benefit if she became a member of the board," Byty said.
Doyle said: “I am ready to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help correctly direct sports in Scotland. ”
The American who won the titles at 200 and 400 meters at the Atlanta Games in 1996, along with the four gold medals won in the Olympic Games and now appearing regularly as a BBC commentator, could not go after he suffered a transitional Islamic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time would show whether or not I would recover or how much.
The whole process was hardened, but I managed to recover completely, I can go back and do agile exercise again!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump commercial in which mothers are compared to cows has caused the division of online opinions
A breast-producing company has caused the division of opinions on the Internet when it publishes an ad in which breast-feeding mothers are compared with cow milking.
To mark the launch of the product that is said to be the "the quietest breast pump in the world", the user-oriented technology company "Elvie" published a funny commercial inspired by music videos to show the freedom that the new pump has provided to breast-feeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay of a song whose text sounds like this: "Yes, I mull milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed this isn't crowbark, these are my breasts."
The refrain continues: “Pump, pump, feed, pump, pump, mingle my breasts. ”
However, the advertising published on Facebook by the company caused controversies on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many said it emphasized the "užas" of the dairy industry.
"It is a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
They, just like us, should become pregnant and breed so they can produce milk, with the exception of the fact that their children are stolen from them after just a few days after they are born," one of the comments said.
Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in breastbuilding ("Elvie"/ "Mother")
Another comment says this: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for her mother too.
But yes, why don't you use them to advertise a breast pump that keeps their babies?"
Another added: “Really an inappropriate commercial. ”
Others, however, defended the commercial, and a woman admitted that she felt that the song was really “smeшна. ”
"I think this idea is brilliant.
I would have bought a pump like this if I were still breast-feeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a genius product," one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is an entertaining commercial for mothers who use milk (often in their jobs or in toilets) and feel like " cows."
This is not an ad that lacks or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced while discreet pumps were stuck in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
Still, Elvie’s pump is completely quiet, no wires, no pipes and discreetly fits in the breastbuilding, giving women the freedom to move, keep their babies, or even get out of the house while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and RDR in Mother, commented: “Elvie pump is really a revolutionary product and deserves courageous and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between women who mix milk and dairy cows, we wanted to milk with pump and challenges to put the same thing in the center of attention, showing the amazing feeling of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump is present in all titles.
During the fashion week in London, the mother of two children showed up on the fashion runway for designer Martha Yakubowski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly moved to a tent camp on the border of Texas
The number of children migrants in custody has significantly increased although the border crossing at monthly level remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the sharp rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult for the children to be sponsored.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were unreported immigrants and feared to jeopardize their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child sponsor.
The risk rose in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official witnessed to the Congress last week that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied for sponsoring minors without escorts.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested people have no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or sponsors or sponsors' family are illegally staying in the country and many of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we continue to pursue those individuals," Mr. Alberts said.
In order to process the children's cases faster, authorities introduced new rules in accordance with which some of them would be required to appear in court within a month after they were detained, not within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard voted.
Many of them will appear through a conference video call, not personally, in order to present their legal status case to the immigration judge.
Those believed to be incompatible to obtain relief will be immediately deported.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they will become upset and depressed, the violent outbursts or attempts to escape, they say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the last few months.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornilo, where due to its size, there is more likely to be neglected signs that the child is facing difficulties.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends can increase the traumas most of them already face.
Syria tells US, French, Turkish "occupational forces" to retreat immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Muallem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted eight years.
Mualem, who is also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces were illegally residing in Syria's territory under the excuse that they participated in the fight against terrorism and that "they would act appropriately with them."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the congregation.
Mualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories" from the two terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the territory of this country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the refugee issue, Mualem said the conditions are good for them to return and accused "some of the Western countries" of "expanding irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politizing the issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided assistance for the restoration until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on setting a tampon zone in the last major rebel resistance in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a major attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will be aimed at the jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee composed of members of the government and opposition in order to draw up a concrete constitution for Syria and to open the way to the elections.
Mualem has established the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "examine members of the current constitution", and warned of the consequences of further mixing in it.
Why Tramp Will Win Second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 elections again unless his presidential mandate is terminated by impeachment and scandal, which is likely to be hoped by a large part of the liberalists.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final in the presidency ever seen! ”
From now on, there are no signs of fatigue with the viewers.
Since 2014, the impact rating has increased more than double and has reached 1.05 million in CNN and has nearly tripled and reached 1.6 million in the MSNBC.
Nealsen says that Fox News averages 2.4 million hit-time viewers, which is 1.7 million more compared to the period four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers on the evenings when important news is reported.
"This is like a fire that people feel attracted to because this is not something we understand," says Neil Baer, the main television producer of the drama "Designed Survivor" of ABC as a cabinet secretary who becomes president after Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nel Skovil, a veteran in writing comedies and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride to Boston before 2016 elections.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
"He answered, "Because I think he's really funny," Mrs Skowl told me.
There's a certain fun value in all this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roy case against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, as well as the welfare of the global economy.
Turning this off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you are no longer an informal citizen when you have seen a panel of experts who debate the use of the source of a deep background by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear", a skeleton jacket from the ostrich of Paul Manafort of $15,000 (the clothing with fat arrogance), as he called "The Washington Post" and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Tramp's anatomy.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"A part of what he's doing and giving you the feeling of watching a reality show is that every night brings you something new," says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of Pawn Stars for the rolling team of Tramp's show and everyday conversions (an NFL quarrels, praises Kim Young-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Flace this week, it was sunshine, and the temperature was 80 degrees outside of his home on the north coast of Kawai, but he was closed inside and watched "MSNBC" as he shot CNN.
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

External Relief Into the Mid-Elections in the Upper House Race
It is not surprising that the 17th congress district in Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funds thanks to the reorganization of conventional areas where there are two candidates in the race for the same place.
For this recently reconstructed coastal area in Pittsburgh, Democracy representative Connor Lamb, who received a position in another area of emergency elections last spring.
Lamb is competing with another candidate, the Republican Keith Rothfus, who presents the old 12th congress area, which is largely overlap with the new 17th congress area.
The maps were changed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old areas were manipulated in favour of the Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th congressional area is a difficult competition to finance campaigns among the main sponsors of the parties, the Congress Committee on campaigns of the Democratic Party (DCCC) and the National Campaign Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the emergency elections for the 18th Pennsylvania congress area held in March, characterised by a wide media coverage.
For over a decade, this place was taken by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for support for China, and then quit
Diplomatics stressed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing under little pressure by Washington.
Mr. Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners banished Tramp's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "new decisions not to recognise Tajvan anymore," said Heather Nauert, State Department spokesman in a statement he made early this month.
But only with regard to El Salvador, penalties were taken into account, which received US aid of around $1 140m in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included reducing financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have a harmful impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment rates and murders in it.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administrative officials stressed that they wanted the conference to progress and in an effective way to end any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pens should address the conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attributes to the gathering, diplomats say.
Both three US officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news about heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thoughts on the anonymity situation.
Their views were supported by an external analyst who was close to the administration and who also spoke of the anonymity state.
Learn History
The next thing that could happen is the announcement of Special Advisor Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Tramp, for which there are a lot of solid evidence in the public records right now.
Mr. Miller reportedly also directs his investigation to the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in her attack on our elections.
If Congress's composition changes, Mr. Tramp will have to take responsibility in that body while preparing to reappear before the voters, and perhaps even before a jury formed by his colleagues.
There's a lot of uncertainty here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, or his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic should make certain choices that will affect the duration of this fight.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to take a state strike against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakians in Minhen.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history turns around such changes and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these changes.
What do we do if Mr. Tramp resigns to Deputy Public Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in the hot chair after the newspaper announced that last year he suggested that he record the president secretly and speculated that he is inadequate to the position he is performing.
Mr Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is incorrect.
"What will we do if Brett Kavano's new investigation requested by the FBI is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence in front of the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And first of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the elections for the Congress that will accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fall for all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that won't happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light candles for Sabbath to a table with a swastika logo.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorans from Rangers with optimistic attitude in front of the Rapid Vienna clash
Rangers are hosting the Rapid Vienna conflict on Thursday, and they are aware of the fact that after the unsolved game played against Villarreal in Spain at the beginning of this month, the victory over Austrians will strengthen their position to qualify in the G League Europe Group.
Graham Dorrence, the middle-row player due to knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the unsolved 2-2 match with "Villarreal", but he believes that "Rangers" can use that result as a jumpboard to greater achievements.
"It was a good point for us because "Villarreal" is a good opponent," the 31-year-old player said.
"We entered the game by believing that we could achieve something and returned with a winning point.
Maybe we could give a little more at the end, but the unsolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we did our best in the second half and were better.
On Thursday, we have another great European night ahead.
I hope we'll win three points, but it's gonna be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll return and we'll get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a difficult year, considering everything that happened, or my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a positive factor about the place.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy; training is good.
I hope we can now move forward, leave the past season behind us and achieve success."
Women cannot sleep at night because of this fear associated with pension savings
Although researchers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke with their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by "Nationwide" said they talked to their mates about long-term care expenses.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they do not take steps to discuss the same thing," says Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationwide Life Insurance Company.
Here's where you need to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You can’t prepare your family to care if you do not share your desires with them in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family and discuss where and how to get care because such elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care funding elections can include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid life insurance policy in cash, which can help you cover your expenses or secure your own insurance with your own resources, if you have them.
Fix your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
Take out the medical care so that you can fill the person with confidence to oversee your medical care and provide health professionals to respect your desires if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the full power of your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person of confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer the questions about the medicines that he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.

A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracomb
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle coming home from out.
The victim of some 40 years of age was found in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracomb when he was shot in his chest, stomach, and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as a "circuit act."
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are appealing to the witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the number of victims expected to increase.
Due to the interruption of communications, aid persons cannot obtain information from the Dongala County, a district north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people from Palu were evacuated after the disaster.
Several key facts on Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulavessi continue:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulavesi province, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379.800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when he was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a district that stretches more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) on the coast of the northwest of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, representing an administrative region within the province, was estimated in 2017 by the population of 299.9.
Fishing and agriculture are the main sources of income for the province's Central Sulavessi economy, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
The extraction of nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
The Indonesian disaster mitigation agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit and west Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Fire Ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Achech in the northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami that struck in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them were residents of Achech.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that destroyed the southern coast, and nearly 700 people died.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the area near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai's islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis that reached 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages and then killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake hit the Piddy Jaya County in Achech, causing waste and panic because it reminded people of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed by fallen buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, with more than 500 people killed, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stuck.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for accusations of family violence
Trek Palin, the oldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Vasila, Aljaska, was arrested on suspicion of family violence, mixing in a family violence report and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by police officials in Alaska.
In accordance with the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is at the Mat-Su detention facility with a chance of going out if he pays $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when they asked him how to plead before the court, the network said.
Palin faces three A-class violations, which means he can be sentenced in prison for up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a B class violation, sentenced with one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time to file criminal charges against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on the police to report the alleged attack.
The case in front of the Alaska veteran court is under way.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic assault, mixing in the family violence crime report and possession of alcoholic weapons on the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016, after saying that her son's violent behavior came from PTSD, the result of his service in Iraq.
A earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit Indonesian island Sulavesi on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disconnected, and the number of victims are expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake hit the area near Central Sulavessi, which is northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social media circulates videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors request a rare death penalty for a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died, a rare sentence that has not been committed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rental truck on Home Depot in October to attack the West Side Highway and run over the pedestrians and bicycles who found on his way.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov purposefully killed the eight victims and deliberately caused serious physical injuries, according to the intention of seeking death penalty sent to the Southern District of New York.
In accordance with the judicial documents, there is a possibility to sentence death after both of these grounds of the prosecution's act.
Several weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed a 22-based indictment against Saipov, including eight murder charges for racketing purposes, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
In order to carry out the attack, it needed "detaljable planning and imagination," prosecutors said, with the way Saipov committed it described as "human, cruel and perverted".
"Syfulo Habibulaevich Saipov has caused, damage, damage and loss of families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, En-Lore Decette, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the state's intention reports said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since a death sentence was prosecuted in the Southern District in New York.
The defendant, Khalid Burns was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was committed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julia and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who was executed after being convicted of spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
The police said he told the investigators that he felt good about what he did.
In accordance with the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded innocent on all 22 grounds of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "objectively disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of accepting a plea of guilt and pronounce a life sentence without a chance of liberation will only continue the trauma of these events for all involved in them," Paton said.
Saipov's defense earlier urged prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
MP from the Tori party says NYGEL FARAZ should be in charge of Bregzit negotiations
Nigel Faraz today during a protest at the party's "Tori" conference pledged to "mobilize the people's army".
The former party leader Ukip said politicians must "feel the heat" from the Euroskeptics, with one of Teresa May's lawmakers suggesting that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
The conservative supporter Peter Bonn said on the Bermingham march that the United Kingdom would have "been outside the EU so far" if Mr Faraž was Secretary for Bregzit.
However, the challenge faced by Mrs. May in terms of the merger of its deeply divided members was highlighted by counter-Bregzit members of the "Tori" party who joined a special protest against Bregzit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing Checkers' plan despite pro-Bregzit attacks, counter-Bregzit persons and the EU.
Allies insisted that it would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that it would force Euroskeptics and Labour Party members to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr Bon said at the pro-Bregzit meeting "Leave Means Leave" in Solihal that he wants to "repel the Chekers plan".
He suggested Mr Faraz should be involved and that he should be accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be outside the EU by now," he said.
The Velingborough MP added: "I will support Bregzit, but we must reject the Chekers plan."
By expressing his stance against the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars so far to be subjected.
We want to create our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bonn rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wants to remain in the EU is completely inaccurate."
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tori and Pro-Bregzit party, also attended the march and told reporters: "I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chekers plan is not well accepted by the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, not well accepted by our party and our activists who are actually those who come out on the streets and who are due to our victory in the elections.
Please give up the Checkers plan and start listening to us."
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraz said at the gathering that politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to surrender the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, people, and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to hand over Bregzit, and we are here today to tell them that "we won't let you get away with it."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Bregzit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the nation's army of this country that allowed us to win in Bregzit and which will not stop until we become independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, counter-Bregzit faces marched through Birmingham, before having a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
After the group's gathering, a few activists appeared this weekend carrying banners with the inscription "Torians against Bregzit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the conservatives on security issues that they faced at the opening of a conference regarding the application created by the party.
"These are people who tell us that they can establish IT systems and all the necessary technologies for Canada plus, for the border without control, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It is a complete farce.
There is nothing called good Bregzit," he added.
Warren plans to consider running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says "will consider running for president" after November elections.
Boston Globe announced that the representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about his future during the town hall in West Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, the honor critic of President Donald Trump, will run in November's re-elections against Republican Republican Party representative Jeff Dill, who was the leader of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.

The event Saturday afternoon in Holliok was her 36th meeting with the voters after Trump came to the presidential post, which uses the city hall format.
One of the attendants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren answered that it's time "women go to Washington to fix our broken government, which includes putting women on top."

The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Ditheon Simpson, 20, at a 11-hour press conference.
They released a video of Friday's shooting, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University campus early Friday morning.

Grand Priz of Russia: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after the team with its orders provided him with victory over Sebastian Vetel
Since Saturday, Walteri Botas qualified before Louis Hamilton became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a major role in the race.
From the semi-position, Botas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the cord while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his teammate.
Vetel went first into the boxing and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that had to play a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went forward after the action one on one who forced Ferrari's driver unwillingly to leave the inside of his free risk to stay away after the double move to defend himself on the third corner.
Max Verstopen began from the rear of the network and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round ended in seventh.
Then he led in most of the race and directed the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish and reach Kimi Raiconen, taking the fourth place.
He eventually entered the 44th round boxing, but he couldn't raise the pace in the other eight rounds, so Raiconen came to the fourth place.
Today is a hard day because Walteri has done a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who lets me spend.
The team has made a really extraordinary decision to have a couple in the race," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body speech.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Fainstein at a rally Saturday on her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford indicting candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Cavanno for sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil and rude and infatuated".
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's been going on in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and wicked and unreasonable and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at announcements and leaks of information, they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Diana Fainstein, did you leak this information?
Remember her answer... did you publish the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't announce it."
Wait a minute, then.
Did we announce it... no, we didn't announce it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Fainstein with information on the charges against Cavanaugh by Ford in July, and it was published in early September, but Fainstein denied that the leaking of information came from her office.
"I did not hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I did not publish her story," Fainstein told the committee, the Hill announced.
"She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked."
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same thing at Saturday's rally: “I will tell you one thing, it was a really bad body speech.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it was the worst speech of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing defending the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use allegations to achieve their own goals.
"They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their malice, subtlety, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they need to nail to regain their power and control," the president said as saying "Mediaite".
Elytic League: “Dundee Stars” 5-3 “Belfast Giants”
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants in the Dundee game
"Dundee Stars" compensated for the loss of the Elytic League match on Friday against "Belfast Giants" by winning a 5-3 rematch in Dandi on Saturday.
Giants received the advantage of two goals achieved by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney took advantage of the host before Dwyer returned the Giants leadership.
Francois Bushar equaled for "Dundee" before Lucas Lundwald Nilsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third defeat in the season within the elite league for Adam Kifi's boys, who retaliated with the victory over "Dundee" 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with Giants winning in the previous three matches.
The chance for Dwyer came at the fourth minute, or at 3:35 by adding Kendall McFall, which adding was provided by David Rutherford while Bovilier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the contest, Sullivan provided the host's leadership at 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Kauni to achieve the 15:16 result.
Dwyer provided Giants to take the lead until the first break, when he reached the second goal for the night of the first period.
The host regrouped and Buchard regained them with a powerful game and goal, with the result 27:37.
Couni and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nilsen for the first time to provide the "Dundee" leadership in the match late in the second period and he secured his team's victory half of the fifth match.
Giants, who lost four of their last five matches, will play their next Friday's home course in Milton Kaines.
Flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane rescue from the earthquake
The pilot controller in Indonesia was famous as a hero after he died helping an airplane with hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a major earthquake hit Sulavesi Island on Friday, causing tsunamis.
Strong consecutive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, and many are stuck in the ruins of the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues escaped to save their own life, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave the position at the Mutiara Al-Jufri Airport tower in Palu, which was constantly swinging.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air plane with the number of flight 6321 that was on the runway at the time would fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower the moment he thought the tower was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Syrait, a spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news broke our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, and the disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Buttong is limited.
"The number of victims is believed to increase because many bodies are still under the ruins, while many cannot even be accessed," the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "A quick help brings bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimarkets are robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia hastes to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Vidododo arrived in Palu on Sunday and ordered the National Army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation assignments.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
In early this year, Indonesia was affected by earthquakes in Lombok, with more than 550 people killed.
A Micronesia plane crash: “Air Niugini ” now says a man disappeared after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated with the plane that fell into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared after earlier stated that 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by a sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said since Saturday afternoon they couldn't find the male passenger.
The airline said it works with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the demands for more details about the passenger, such as its age or citizenship.
Local boats helped save other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while he was trying to land at the Chuck Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they are all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane hit the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
The American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's extremely good work," Janes said.
Janes said that he and the others managed to cross the water that reached halfway to the exits for an emergency plane that sunk.
He said the stewardess were panicking and shouting, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working near the reconstruction of the port also helped rescue, using a boat of blowing overloaded people on the coast before the plane sank into about 30 feet (100 feet) of water.
Air security network data indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in PNG in the past two decades, but no airline has been involved in airlines Air Niugini.
Analyst set up a time frame on the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended with presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man who was accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst from the U.S. Justice Ministry, testified for hours as an investigator in the area of intelligence analysis.
He stressed on the jury that he was using phone records to connect the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlet said he received information on the location of several mobile phones that indicate that Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which is contrary to his previous statements, the Clarion Ledger reported.
On the basis of the data, his cell phone was with Chambers at the time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he "lied because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlet said that for a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defence should present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide on the case later that day.

Another nigger?!
New York Daughter sues a married couple because she was fired after sending a “racist ” message
The New York Daughter sued a couple because she was fired on the grounds of discrimination after she mistakenly received a message from the mother who complained about the fact that she was “an other black girl. ”
The married couple denies that they are racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of the new nurse Giselle Morris found out she was a black girl.
"Noeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee another nigger," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in the message directed to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After she realised what Plasco-Flaxman actually did, feeling "uncomfortable" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying their friendly nanny, afro-American, had badly done her job and that instead she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, announced New York Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris sues the married couple and demands compensation for $350 a day's dismissal in a period of six months, an engagement that will include living with her family, what she was initially engaged to, but without making a deal.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told "Post" on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The married couple replied to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying Mrs. Morris's dismissal was a reasonable procedure because they feared they could no longer trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told "Post".
"But would you trust your children to the face you were rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be realistic."
Saying that the lawsuit was "extortion," Plasco said his wife had only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That's not very nice," he added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still under way, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear that readers will not be able to connect with a bear who speaks, revealed in a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: “It is really hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
It is very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before getting an inspiration to write the book of a small bear bear, he would still be optimistic if his work was not well accepted, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was "and bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt quietly proud of his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
"But since you felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child who reached something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you yourself.
I think Paddington's success took him that way.
Although it was about creation and fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on a deathbed, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
When landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"They called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that it is expected he would not survive," Mrs. Ednan-Laperus said.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effects of the medicines that doctors gave her to maintain her heart pumping slowly declined and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay calm."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz mourning her daughter's loss got on the plane along with other passengers, unconscious of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I laid my head down, and the tears did not stop.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Sad women put cards on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost close persons for suicide strive to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries set up cards on the Velsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son had a great potential to become a chef, as well as a contagious smile.
"They all remembered him after his smile.
People always said his smile could light any room."
However, he gave up his work before he died because he was “in a really dark place. ”
His brother, who then was 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 since he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly fear that this will have a consistent effect."
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "to let others know that there are people out there who can address and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence, you have to start talking."
Mrs. Humphries, who's a long friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner, Mark, who she was married 15 years after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, or didn't say anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas when the children opened their gifts, and he didn't look them in the eye at all and made no contact with them."
She said that his death was a tremendous trauma for all of them, but they must find a way to go through it: “This sort of thing destroys the family.
It leaves us broken.
But we must continue and fight."

Brett Cavanaugh's future is uncertain since the FBI initiated the investigation
"I thought that if we could actually get something that resembles what he was looking for, or an investigation with a limited range of time, we might be able to achieve a small unity," Mr. Flejk said on Saturday, adding that he fears that the committee "falls apart" in the conditions of a rooted partisan-free state.
Why didn't Cavanaugh and his supporters from the Republican Party want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their hesitation is only due to the timing.
Medium elections should be held in just a few weeks, or on November 6th, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to be elected their man as a member of the country's highest court.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI announces his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano can get at least 50 votes at the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pens to change the unsolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea "small" under Kim's leadership
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea declined after Kim Yong-un came to power seven years ago, a MP from South Korea said.
Park Beeong-seug, quoted as saying South Korean reunion ministry data because last year there were 1.127 border crossings compared to 2011 when there were 2.706.
Mr Park said that strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs of human traffickers are key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
Most of North Korean refugees receive citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, where the longest border is located with North Korea and which can be easier crossed compared to a well-protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China views these people as illegal migrants, not refugees and often repatriates them in force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly over the last few months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss themes that focused on the stalling of the talks on day-to-day.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Tramp and Kim Young-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal -- Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
However, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho accused the sanctions imposed by the United States on stagnating progress ever since.
"If there is no confidence in the United States; there will be no confidence in our national security and in such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve at the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the House of Representatives called the candidate for Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said if his temperament is taken into account, it is inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi announced this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not think that if a woman acted that way, they would say she was "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassi Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his induction, sometimes he even shouted and cried when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organised by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016's presidential elections.
Pelosi said she believes Cavanaugh's testimony is evidence that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court because he proved biased against Democrats.
"I think it disqualifies itself with these statements and the way it attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question whether she would try to take Kavano out of office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this: if he does not speak the truth before the Congress or before the FBI, then he is not only appropriate to serve at the Supreme Court, but he is not appropriate to serve in a court where he is at office at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge at the District Appeal Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about possible verdicts that Cavanaugh will bring against the Law on Accession Healthcare or Roy against Wade, as he is believed to be subject to conservative justice.
In hearings to confirm his candidacy, Kavano did not answer questions on whether to undo any of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now it's not time for an hysterical, biased man to enter the court and expect us to say, "it's really wonderful, isn't it," Pelosi said.
Women should use it, too.
It's a really sharp criticism, months and years of anger gathering that she can't free from herself without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinham told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continued: “A woman who was performing an executive function has helped me, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she managed to develop her technique, so when she gets angry and starts crying, she tells the person she talks to, “You may think I am sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she keeps crying.
I think it's genius."
The tears are allowed as a exhaust valve for anger partially because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in the office where men dominated was when I once started crying with an inexplicable anger and an older woman, a cold manager of whom I always had a certain fear, caught me for my neck and dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will enjoy the fact that they've managed to reach you."
Patricia Schroeder was a Colorado Democratic congresswoman and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987 when Mr. Hart was caught in an alien affair of a ship called Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she didn't consider the idea of running for president.
"It was not a well-considered decision," he told me 30 years later through laughter.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "The Snow and the Seven Eggs."
Given the fact that the campaign had been launched long ago, she didn't have enough funding, so she promised she wouldn't enter the race if she didn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would only give her $25.
"Do they think there should be a discount for me?" she wondered.
During the speech that announced that it would not start a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions, or gratitude to people who supported her, frustrating from the system that made it so hard to collect funds and to target voters, not delegates and anger to sexism, she began to cry.
"If you saw me, you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder remembers how the media reacted to the event.
"You would think "Clinex" was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my cemetery.
"She cries"?
How trade war between the United States and China can be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of the fire with the beginning of the trade war between the United States and China was obstructing, even though the battle was far from over, the conflict between countries could be useful for Beijing in the long-term, experts say.
Donald Tramp, President of the United States, gave the first warning in early this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation has escalated significantly over this week by introducing new tariffs for $200 billion worth (150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing would return to nature every time, or recently imposed tariffs from five to ten percent of US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to return to the United States at an equal rate, and it is unlikely that the second largest economy in the world will give up the same thing soon.
To make Washington retreat means accepting his demands, but public worship in front of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, the pressures of the US trade war can result in positive support for China in the long term because the interdependence of the two economies will be reduced.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for the start of a sudden decline from an economic aspect in any of the countries is much more dangerous than previously identified by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate focused on Asia in the New American Security Centre, which represents a tink-tank.
Syria "prepared" for refugee return, Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country that has remained devastated by the long war that lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mualem said the conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the field is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to renew areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
Now all conditions are provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that reflected on their daily life and daily life.
The UN estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six additional million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes aid in the restoration of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept parole or aid from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Europe's team beat the US team at the Ryder Cup 2018 with a final score of 16.5 to 10,5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in the European field and has not won the Ryder Cup title in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the primate after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14,5 points that were needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, at his first hole blow, put the ball in the water in a pair-3 to the 16th hole, losing from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golf player Molinari pointed out in all rounds, becoming one of the four players who scored 5-0-0 after the 1979 tournament began to be organized.
American Jordan Spit lost with a score of 5:4 of the lowest ranked European team player, Thorbjorn Olessen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest ranked player in the world, lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, who may have last played the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participants in eight Ryder Cups, became the European one who won the most titles in the 25,5-point tournament during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
This year was really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we got the title back.
The team's game is the most important and I'm happy that I could help," the emotional Garcia said after the victory of Europe.
He now departs his countryman John Ram, who beats Tiger Woods on Sunday, the American golf legend, with a result of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud that I beat Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him as a game," Rama, 23, said.
Woods lost in all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 at the Ryder Cup.
It's about an incredible statistics of one of the best players of all times, who won 14 big titles, ranking by Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to direct the game to low grass fields, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
US team captain Jim Furik after his team's disappointing game said "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
In one period this morning, we put difficulties on the team of Europe.
We fought.
A hat down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with America's professional golfers Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit to them.
They outplayed us.
