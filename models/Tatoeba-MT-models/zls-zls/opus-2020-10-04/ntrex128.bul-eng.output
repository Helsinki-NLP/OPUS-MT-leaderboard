The members of Wells ’ Assamble are concerned that “they look like muppets ”
Part of the members of the Association are amazed by the proposal to change their call to the ‘CHUP’ (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the "Welsh's Parliament".
Members of the entire political spectrum are concerned that this could be a cause of mockery.
One of the leaberists said that his group was concerned that the new name was “rimmed with Tup and Dubub. ”
For readers outside Wells: In Welsh this is definitely offensive.
According to one of the members of the Plaid party, the whole group is "not happy" and has proposed alternatives.
The representative of the Welsh Conservative Party pointed out that his group was "not convincing" to change the name, but noted that the new name CNR (in English – MWP) has a distinct similarity with "mupet".
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire pronouncement of the letter U.
The Commission of the Association, which currently draws up the draft draft to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision for all the descriptions called members of the congregation will belong to the members themselves. ”
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 gave Wells' assemblies the power to change my own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public examination on the proposals which established broad support for the Association to begin calling it "Wels' Parliament".
As far as its members are concerned, the Commission prefers "members of Wells' Parliament shortly as "CHUP", but the "CHUP" option has received the largest support since the inquiry to the society.
The members of the assembly offer alternative options, but reaching a consensus will obviously be a headache for President Elin Jones, which is expected to submit the draft draft for the change in a few weeks.
The Reforming Law will include other changes in the manner of the Association, i.e. rules for disqualifying its members, as well as the design of the Commission's system.
The members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they reach the debate of the draft.
Macedonians vote in a referendum whether to change their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote whether to change their country's name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia.
The referendum is scheduled to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has an administrative area called "Macedonia".
Athens has long insisted that her northern neighbour's name represents a claim to the Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the change of the name of the state, has pronounced itself not to respect the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name of the state is simply the price to pay for accession to the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s bells shut up on the background of the church’s difficulties in Harlem
"If we look at the historical plan, according to the old people I talked to, there was a bar and a church literally at every corner," Mr Adams said.
"Today both are gone."
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today socialize in different ways," he adds.
"The bars are no longer the neighborhood daily, where all are gathered regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the heads expect, “and sooner or later they will be in the same situation”.
The man adds that churches can be replaced by apartment blocks where people live who do not help survive the rest of the sanctuary of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy housing in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the closure process of these churches, as it is not particularly likely most of the new settlers will be visiting them."
Both churches were built by white pastures before Harlem became the neighbourhood of the black people – the Metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin's decade later.
The original white methodistic pasture has been carried out in the years after 1930.
Then the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken by black Christians under the direction of Reverend John Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is the main market street in Harlem, as they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered severe fire damages, but Father Johnson's parishers made a plan for her restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and the heir of St. Martin, proudly calls them “poor bells. ”
The expert using the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure ” and“ an indispensable historical instrument. ”
The relevant expert, Tiffany Ngu, from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first system of bells in the world that was used by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger system in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentions that St. Martin never replaced him.
What has been played in St. Martin in the last few weeks has been a complicated story, drawn up by architects and performers, some brought by the world’s heads of the church, and others from the bishop's excellence.
From the news story - which is the leading body of the pasture, which consists of world leaders - wrote to the Eparhy in July, expressing their concerns that the eparhy "will be inclined to transfer the costs to the press, although he did not have a role in hiring architects and performers sent by the Eparhy.
Some parishists complained about the lack of transparency by the Eparchia.
A 13-year-old child was hurt by a shark hunting for lobsters in California
Acula attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while roaming for lobsters in California on the first day of the hunting season, the representative authorities reported.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hamel shared with KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diveling with friends about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and went in with a whole group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, and then realized how he shouted “He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hamel said when he got to the boy, he found out that the whole area of his key was torn apart.
"I called everyone out of the water because there is a shark!" Hamel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Children's Hospital Radi in San Diego, where he was accepted in critical condition.
He's still not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
The savior, Captain Larry Giles, was pronounced on a media briefing that a few weeks earlier in the water, a shark was spotted, but it was overestimated that it was not dangerous.
Jills adds that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the top of her body.
The responsible authorities have closed access to the coastline from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Suomi in Ensitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is under way.
Jills notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them do not pose danger to people.
Sainsbury plans an offensive on the magnificent British market for decorative products
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening stands for decorative products in its facilities, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the considerable offensive in the UK market for decorative products, which is estimated at 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household products decrease, the largest stands for decorative products will be located in 11 shops across the country, and then, in the success of the initiative, similar products will be found in more facilities.
The investment turn in the decorative adult is made at the moment when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the stelages, until recently taken by TVs, microwaves and other household devices.
Sainsbury said they would double the number of products offered to 3000 products, including marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current product ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more place, like the suggestions in Boots stores.
The supermarket also releases its boutique gamma makeup so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly wanted by younger users.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrant Shop will test discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croyden, southern London last week, while the second one will be opened in Seli Ouk, Birmingam later this year.
Shopping online and moving focus on shopping smaller quantities of food daily at a time leads to the need for supermarkets to make more efforts to attract customers.
Mike Coop, the CEO of Sainsbury, shared that the objects would look more like universal stores, while the supermarket chain is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl disclosures, offering more services and non-properties.
From Sainsbury they have objects of Argos in hundreds of stores, and they also open Habitats objects since they bought both chains two years ago – which company claims has increased the sales of food and has made the benefits even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to refine its objects for decorative and pharmaceutical products was failed.
Sainsbury made a shared experience with Boots in the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute on the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company objects in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business with 281 Celesio objects, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy chain for 125 million pounds three years ago.
From there they claim that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a rich gamma luxury brands for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hix, the commercial director of Sainsbury, made the following statement: “We have transformed the type and character of our decorative stands to improve the overall experience of our customers.
We also invested in special training for our colleagues, who would offer professional advice in place.
The proposed gamma marks aims to respond to every taste and all needed in a convenient environment with a comfortable location, and this combination turns us into an attractive destination for decorative products that leads the challenge to the concept of the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "angered" after Holly Willoby's resignation from an 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den Peter Jones was "excited" after the TV leading Holly Willoby gave up a deal for 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Villabi doesn't have time for the brand of household devices and accessories Truly.
The couple's business is compared to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrou.
The 37-year-old leader of "This morning" announced her leaving in Instagram.
Holly Willoby left the star from Dragons Den Peter Jones "to squeeze" after pulling out of their incoming business with the brand of lifstein products at the last minute – in order to focus on its own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones has "excited" when the "gold girl" on TV confessed during a intense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to 1.5 million pounds, mean that there will be no more time for his brand of household products and accessories Truly.
Business is convenient to the Goop brand of Guinet Poltrow, as rumors are that he has doubled Willobi's fortune, whose value is predicted at 11 million pounds.
When the 37-year-old Willoby announced in Instagram his leaving Truly, Jones left Britain with a plane to head to one of his holiday properties.
One of the sources said: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be its long-term commitment to ensure its future in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave the sculptures absolutely all unprepared.
No one believed this could happen on Tuesday so close to the start.
There is a warehouse in Marlowe that is full of waiting for products to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leading of this morning, which is one of the most successful British stars, could cost the company millions because of the large investment in products vary from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to delay in the placing of the brand on the market.
And not at last, it may also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willbee, who's been mother to three children, along with her husband, Dan Boldwin, is a close friend of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Villabi herself founded Truly along with Cap in 2016, as Jones, who was 52, joined as president of the company in March.
The two families often take vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of Boldwin's TV production company.
Willoby will become a " ambassador" to the M&S brand and will also replace Anne McParlin as the leader of the "I'm the celebrity" broadcast on ITV.
A source close to Jones last night made the following statement: “We will not comment on his business. ”
Severe negotiations leading to "foot of relations"
He was joking about the criticisms he would bear from the news channels about making comments that someone would consider "inadequate to the president" and too positive for the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump resign so much?
Trump replied in his joke "new" way.
"I have not withdrawn anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first was held in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a major step towards the removal of North Korean nuclear weapons".
But the negotiations for the removal of this weapon are in stall.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, the North Korean diplomat Ri Young Ho told UN representatives that North Korea "is not seeing the reciprocal attitude" by the United States towards the first steps of his country on the road of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues to sanctions aimed at maintaining tension.
Trump presented in his speech a much more optimistic view of things.
"Our relations with North Korea are wonderful," he noted.
"We were on our way to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we are now enjoying wonderful relationships."
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have resulted in positive results – termination of missile tests, release of hostages and return to the home of the US military bodies.
He also defended his neortodoxal approach to negotiations with Kim.
"It is extremely easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this crowd, we would have about 200 people right there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of ourselves.
Tsunamis and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and led to the deaths of hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok of foreign NGOs, it was said that they did not need them.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population were forced to leave their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for the launch of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, there is a unambiguous opinion that there is no need for international assistance, which makes things slightly challenging," Mrs Sumbung said.
While "Save the children" is forming a team to head to Palu, it is still not certain whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the territory of the country.
The national spokesman of the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, announced that Indonesian authorities are currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to recovery efforts.
Taking into account the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this kind of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Achech in the case of tsunami, they are not often seen in view of the other shores.
The apparent lack of Tsunami warning cheese in Palu has likely contributed to the loss of life, although a warning has been issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make this logistics even more complicated.
Until recently stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake hospital ship headed to Palu, but it will take at least three days before he reaches the place of the new disaster.
President Joko Widododo has turned the improvement of the late Indonesian infrastructure into the centre of his campaign, investing a large amount of means in roads and rail lines.
But insufficient finances are constantly harassing his office, while Joko re-establishes the ure in the next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure, born by continuing sectantic tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with swords, bows and arrows, as well as other original weapons.
Look: Daniel Stearridge brought a late equality for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sterridge saved Liverpool from loss in the High League against Chelsea with a goal at the 89th minute this Saturday at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an appetite from Gerdan Shakiri at about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door while his team was behind 1-0.
He set the ball on his left leg, then put a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the criminal field and headed to the top right corner of the network.
She transferred the plagiarel Kepa Arisabalaga and blew unsafely into the network.
"I made sure to take a good position to master the ball, because players like Shak always look for passing in front positions, so I just tried to win as much time as possible for a good shot at the door," Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the coming Kante, I pushed my ball, and I just shot without much thinking about it."
Chelsea took 1-0 in the 25th minute after the goal of her Belgian star One Azar.
The Blue Assaulter handed a heel to Mateo Kovacic, then sprinted from the middle of the field to the half of Liverpool.
Kovačić exchanged a quick double pass in the center.
Then he launched a fast firing pass with which he took Azar to a clean position in the criminal field.
Azar runs the defenders and scores with his left foot in the far corner next to Liverpool Alison Becker's doorman.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the group stage of the Championship League at 3:00 this Wednesday at San Paolo Stadium in Napole, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA League at 3:00 p.m. in London.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue turns into the latest memory hit through "rewriting history"
Its ban will be poetic justice for its almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, which was done by its fanatic puritanic followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insensitive" and "the history rewriting attempt".
John Goldsmith, the President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in this discussion to remove the statues of Oliver Cromwell to the Westminster Palace to become a goal.
The economy of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor committed by Cromwell.
Maybe the wrong Cromwell will be turned into a victim because of the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft is proof of the opinion in the 19th century and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider as a deserving respect.
Mr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more in the 19th century than today, as Parliament’s defender against external pressure, of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is a complete precise presentation is the subject of a continuous historic debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognized person, which represents one side of the coming division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve the marking and celebration."
A pig-killer wounds a deadly Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man identified only by his last name as Yuan was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near the Liupanshui market in the province of Guijou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pork was preparing to inject its pigs with vaccines in Sinin from the province of Sinhai, China, on 30 May 2005.
He was supposed to arrive along with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead, and he also found the door to the next vault open.
He also reported that there was a big male pig in the carriage with a blood buzz.
The judiciary expertise confirmed that 550-pound pig has attacked a mortal farmer, the report reported.
"My cousin's foot was bled and disgraced," Guiyang Evening News quoted Cousin Wu as saying.
A security camera recording shows how Yuan goes to the market at 4:40 Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal killer didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager has reported to Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he can't attack anyone else while the police collect evidence from the crime scene.
It is also reported that Yuan's family and market management negotiations on compensation for the death case.
Although they're rare, it's been reported before about pigs attacking people.
In 2016, a pig attacked her wife and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and after the attack, the man was severely injured.
Ten years before that, a 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to banish him.
After a oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "current trigger".
"They just play.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... they have no intention of hurting anyone.
But a man must treat them with respect," the man graduates.
The weakening hurricane Rosa will lead to common and diarrhea rains in the southwest of the United States
According to the weather forecast, the hurricane Rosa loses weight as it moves over the cold waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will lead to flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwest parts of the United States.
Rosa includes winds from 85 miles per hour, which is a hurricane of category 1, considered at 5:00 a.m. east time in the morning and is located 385 miles south-west from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
During that time, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a synclinal that moves east to the west coast of the United States. While Rosa approaches the Baha California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will start pushing the tropical moisture deep north to the southwest part of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will lead to 10 inches of rain in some regions of Mexico.
In the next few days, the tropical moisture along with the approaching sinclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At a local level of 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and fast flooding, passages of streams and likely landings in the desert.
The deep tropical moisture will lead to rains from 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Some parts of the southwest are expected from 2 to 4 inches of rain, especially above the majority of Arizona.
There may be lightning floods in rapidly deteriorated conditions due to the dispersed nature of the tropical rain.
It would be extremely unreasonable to travel a paw in the desert when there is a threat from tropical rains.
The heavy rain can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunderstorms will lead to rampant dust and rigid winds.
The approaching sinclinal will lead to heavy rain in some parts on the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach a rainfall of over a half inch, which will lead to tiny waste flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy season valve.
In late Sunday and early Monday, the clouds of tropical rain will start approaching Arizona before the rain covers a larger zone in late Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread over the Four corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October can bring major temperature hesitations to the United States, while the Arctic ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature of short distances.
On Sunday there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There are approximately 20 degrees of temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moine, Iowa.
In the next few days the rest of the summer heat will try to increase and expand.
In most of the central and eastern United States, it is expected to have a warm start in October, and from the southern planes to parts of the northeast, temperatures are expected to prevail about 80 degrees.
The temperature in New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the East of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanau's hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on six TV networks the attractive sight of the nomination witness for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavanau and Christine Blacey Ford -- the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which took place in the '80s of the 20th century.
During that time, political opposition continued, with networks interrupting their regular reverse programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Fleke and according to which the FBI should conduct a weekly investigation on the charges.
Ford told Senate's Department that she was 100% convinced that Kavanau was getting drunk and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanau, in his deprived emotions of witnessing, is absolutely certain that such a thing has never happened.
It's probably even more than Nielsen's reported 20.4 million viewers watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has numbered the average viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no direct data available for other networks that emitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen traditionally experiences difficulties by measuring the number of people who look from their jobs.
To compare, we're talking about an audience similar to the size of the championship football game or the Hollywood prizes.
Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavanau, is the first of all networks with average 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen CBS, NBC – 2.94 million, MSNBC – 2.89 million and CNN – 2.2 million.
The interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
Once a moderate Republican's office declared that he would vote in support of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded him whistling on Friday while trying to catch an elevator for a meeting of the Judiciary Commission.
During the whole harassment for a few minutes, you didn't raise eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I am right here, standing in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you believe he presents the truth to the state?
"You have power while many women are completely helpless," the attacks continued.
Fleke replied that his office had already been released with a declaration, and before the lift doors were closed, he said it would be further pronounced during the hearing by the committee.
The cable and broadcasting networks provided live coverage several hours later, when the Court of Justice had to decide whether to transfer Kavanau's nomination to the full Senate's attention to the vote.
Al Fleke said he would only do this if he was sure that the FBI would review the charges against nominations next week, which the Democrats are insisting on in opposition.
Fleke was partly convinced of talking to his friend, the senator from the Democratic Party, Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanau without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to examine the charges against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political playoffs" with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political games" with Britain's future and in undermine national interests in an interview with Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the conference of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published next to it on the first page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson strengthened his attack against her so-called "the plan for the game of the lady" for Brexit, saying that the collection of customs fees from Britain for the EU and the opposite is "absurd".
Wade Simms' shooting: Police arrested suspect Ditian Simpson for the death of the player from LSU
Police arrested a suspect for the final fatal shooting on Wade Simms, the 20-year-old basketball player in LSU.
Dittian Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on second-degree murder charges, the police department reported in Baton Rouge.
The officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and the police report that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
The cops found the glasses at the site, and they also found Simpson's DNA on them, reports from the CBS WAFB branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he confessed to the fatal shooting against Wade.
His guarantee is set at $35,000, notified by the Advocate.
East Baton Rouge's Eastern Medicines Office published a preliminary report Friday, which indicates a gunshot wound that hits the head and the door as a cause of death.
The government expresses their appreciation to the evasion department of the Luizian state police, the police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents for the aid provided in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Sports Director Jo Aleva thanks local law enforcement authorities for "timely justice".
Simms was 20 years old.
The high 6 feet and 6 inches player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
Average in the last season he reached 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets of the game.
On Friday morning, LSU Will Wade's basketball coach announced that the team was "small" and "in shock" after Wade's death.
Wade said that “this is something that concerns a man all the time. ”
Vulcan spreads ashes over Mexico City
Popocatepetal ashes, which was thrown from the volcano, reached the southern neighbourhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ashes were reported in the last 24 hours.
The center was watching a number of earthquakes and tremors.
Published in social networks images show a thin layer of dust, which covers the front glasses of cars in some of the neighbourhoods of Mexico City, for example in Hokimilko.
Geophysics have marked an increase in volcanic activity, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) south-east of the capital since the 7-1 earthquake of magnitude has shaken downtown Mexico in September 2017.
The Vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police confronted Catalonian separatists before the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for independence faced the gendarmery when thousands joined the opposing demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarising vote for secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmery, began to target the guardians of peace with eggs and paint of dust, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets that usually run by tourists.
Later in the day, there were other clashes with the police, as the police fled to their thumbs to control the situation.
For hours in support of independence, groups have yelled "We do not forget, we do not forgive," while the country's integrity has been retaliated with "Spain forever".
The local press reported that fourteen people received medical assistance as a result of the protests.
The tension remains high in the desired independence region even a year after the referendum held on October 1st was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist cataluns.
The vast majority voted to vote for independence, although the activity was low, as most opposers of secession boycotted the referendum.
According to Cataloni authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in voting sections in the region with a number of stormy conflicts.
The wanted independence groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it was forced to go a different route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer has hopes for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be in a stall," the man added.
Despite the important victory noted, whether in a small difference, in the last December regional elections, the supporters of Catalonia's independence political parties face difficulties this year, as many of their most famous leaders are either in self-appointed exile, or are arrested in anticipation for their role in the organisation of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest on his phone in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians both sides.
His comment is that "it's getting more intense".
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine arrested Cataluan leaders in anticipating a last year's preliminary process, announced that he would run for European Parliament elections next year.
He argues that "my candidateship for European elections is the best way to oppose the regression of democratic values and repressions that we observe by the Spanish government".

Menga's goal brings Livingston's victory with 1-0 over Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston provided victory
The new League League Livingston surprised Rangers and only lost Steven Gerard in his first 18 matches as the manager of the club at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be decisive, and Gary Holt's team matched points with the second in the hybernion classification.
Gerard's team stays out of victory in a foreign field in the High League this season, and next week he stands up against leader Harts, leaving eight points behind in the ranking.
But before that, Rapid Vienna hosted Rapid Vienna in the League of Europe on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has already been in a series of six games without loss at the championship, and manager Holt has still not felt the taste of loss since Kenny Miller changed his post last month.
Livingston has missed good opportunities against unprecedented guests
Holt's team had to lead the result far before he scored the goal, and his direct style of the game made the Rangers extremely difficult.
Scott Robinson breached the defense, but his impact went astray, then Alan Litgow shot by the beam after Craig Halckett returned the ball with his head to him.
The hosts were letting Rangers play ball, knowing they could seriously make it difficult for the static guests.
And that's exactly how it got to the winning goal.
Rangers have committed an injunction, and Livingston has played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined each other and took Menga out, who took his ball and scored from the middle of the criminal field.
Until now, the Rangers were more in control of the ball, but they faced the unprotected protection of the hosts, and the doorman Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This game style continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers' doorman saved Scott Pittman's foot, and a hit with a Littlelow's head passed the door after another static position for Livingston.
In Livingston's penal field, however, the centres that were easily cleaned up, and the judge of twice did not respect the claims of the guests for the dowry – first after unity between Halckett and Glenn Middleton Reserve, and then in doubt about the hand game.
“Fenomental” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at “Tony Macaroni Arena”
Fenomenal game and great result for Livingston.
The team plays just great, continuing to overcome expectations and improve its presentation.
The style of the game and the composition nearly suffered changes after the team returned to the High League, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes in the field.
Captain Halckett was amazing, organizing the defense in an excellent way, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrell under pressure all the time.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's guidance, they demonstrate some great things, but in the case, they were very under these standards.
They missed the last pass before naked, only once they managed to break up the protection of the hosts – this loss must wake Rangers who are currently in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Coleon
On Saturday (September 29th), we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when Turkish and Germany heads met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing NATO allies' relations.
Friendly relationship cools because of problems affecting human rights, media freedom and acceptance of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koln to find a huge new mosque.
The city is home for the largest group of Turks living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented 25 thousand crowds from gathering in front of the mosque, but there were many supporters around who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds protesting Erdogan, many of whom Kurds also raised their voice, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to allow it in the country.
Different protests reflect the fracture caused by a visitor, who is considered a hero of some German Turks and, at the same time, is despised as a despot of others.

Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in a mess
Six prison guards were injured in a high-security man prison rebellion, reports the prison service.
The blast exploded at Long Lartin Prison in Warchester at approximately 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and still continues.
In order to exercise his authority, special officers from the Tordano squad have been called to deal with eight deprived of liberty, as the confining itself to a prison wing.
The injured guards suffered light injuries on their faces and received medical assistance in place.
The spokesman of the Prison Service made the following statement: “There are specially trained employees who will deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six guards got medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons and we extremely clearly say that responsible persons will be handed over to the police by allowing their sentences to be extended."
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after an inmate attack, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the riot divisions were called into prison, where they could control a heavy raid in which the staff was attacked with billiard balls.
Uragan Rosa threatens with lightning flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (because dried areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that Arizona will be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a very high chance that exactly this will happen early next week, while the weakening hurricane Rosa is being carried through the desert in the southwest, taking the risk of lightning floods with her.
The National Meteo Service has already established posts against lightning floods on Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona, South and Eastern Nevada, South East California and Utah, including in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different path over Phoenisk on Tuesday, and may bring rain in late Monday.
The National Meteo service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that “from 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the border of Arizona."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Centre envision 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated quantities up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas from the Southwest Desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great pool, will likely receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, in separate places possible up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are not threatened by lightning floods, the caused by Rose rain may actually be a blessing because the region is severely affected by land.
Although floods are extremely serious concerns, part of the rain is likely to be useful, as the southwest part is currently in land.
According to the US Dried Surveillance Commission, little over 40% of Arizona suffer from at least excessive land, which is the second weight category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane Rosa leads to reaching the land at Baha California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning can still commend at the maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north with 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets colder waters over the Pacific and therefore loses weight.
It is therefore expected to reach the landscape of Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over a part of Mexico can be strong and lead to a significant risk of suppression.
"There is a drizzle of rain from 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, which is possible up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona to South Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely strong rain in Baha California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Centre warned.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and various waste flows in the deserts, as well as landings in mountain fields.

Trump says Kavanau "has suffered from the depravity and anger" of the Democratic Party
"Every vote for Judge Kavanau is a voice that rejects the foul and disgusting tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump announced at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump announced that Kavanau "had suffered from the vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Cavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, decisively rejecting Christine Blacey Ford's indictment for sexual assault from decades ago when the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the indictment hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "today the American people witnessed Cavanaugh's intelligence, courage and qualities".
"Every vote in support of Judge Kavanau is a voice in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a wonderful reputation in the public service," the president told the gathered crowd of Western Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly sees Kavanau's nomination while talking about the importance of the Republican votes for the general elections.
"They leave five weeks to one of the most important elections in our time.
Although I'm not a candidate, I'm actually involved," Trump continued.
"This is why I am going around and fighting to support good candidates."
Trump noted that the Democrats have set themselves a mission "to hinder and disrupt".
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanau's nomination is expected not later than Friday, according to CNN, one of the High Representatives of the Republican Party reported.
Hundreds die after earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increases
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were taken off the coast of giant waves, when a strong earthquake and tsunami defeated the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, authorities reported on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu on Friday, when the coast was swept from waves up to six feet (18 feet), many brought to their deaths and destroyed everything on their way.
Tsunami hits after an earthquake with a 5.5 magnetic magnitude.
"When the threat of tsunami rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, which made many victims of the disaster," said during the briefing at Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the spokesman of the Indonesia BNPB.
"The water drew cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything in its way," Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea with a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
"Some people climbed the trees, so they managed to save themselves from the water," he added.
Nearly 16 700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Published by the Agency for Disasters, pictures of the air showed multiplely destroyed buildings and shops, down and scrambled bridges, as well as surrounded by water mosques.
Secondary earthquakes continued to swing the coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was seen in a region inhabited by 2.4 million people.
The Authority for the evaluation and application of technology (BPPT) of Indonesia declared that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the nuclear bomb released on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographic location of the city, located at the end of the long and narrow bay, may have increased the sizes of tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specifically that thousands of houses, hospitals, commercial centers and hotels have been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of the crashed buildings, the speaker added, then added that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that victims and damage could be higher on the coast of 300km (190 miles) north of Palu, a area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the truss.
He also added that "communications have been completely crossed and there is no information from Dongala".
The Red Cross, on its side, said more than 300,000 people live there, adding that his teams and volunteers have already headed to the affected areas.
"It is already a tragedy, but it can be even more difficult."
On Saturday, the agency was abruptly criticised that she did not inform about the defeat of Palu Tsunami, although officials explained that the waves arrived during the announcement.
Shared in social networks love videos show a man on the top floor of a building who shouts on people on the street panic warnings about approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a vast water wall crashes in the coast, and cars and buildings are being handled.
Reuters failed to authenticate the clip in time.
The earthquake and tsunami have led to a severe interruption of power supply, which has stopped communications around Palu and has made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began to send cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, the responsible authorities reported, but evacuated still desperately needed food and other first-need products.
The city airport was open again only for rescue operations efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widododo will visit evacuation centres in Pali on Sunday.
The dead in Indonesian tsunami are already over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While the employees of the World Vision from Dongala managed to get safely to Palu, where they found shelters in spawn shelters crucified in the courtyard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of desolation, says Mr. Doseba.
"They have told me that they have seen countless ruined houses."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the initial work on rescue and recovery operations of emergency groups, some complain that the experienced wealthy experience in such situations prevents foreign saviors from reaching Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, sending staff and supplies from abroad can only be started if the devastated place is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The disaster is still on regional level," said Aulia Ariani, spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"After the government announced that it is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but from there they have not declared that status yet."
As Palu falls on the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those who are still unknown continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman who was buried under the ruins for two days along with her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the National Paraplanery Team of Indonesia, trained two of the missing paraplaners for the Asian championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among the captured in the Roa-Roa Hotel were his students, Mr Mandagi added.
"As seniors in the paraplanerism field I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalls how in the news about the crash of the Roa-Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to the WhatsApp racers in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue notes, however, the only response to his messages was one-one gray one.
"I think this means that the messages are not delivered," he added.
The thieves raise 26 750 dollars during the charge of a bankomat in Newport on Levi
On Friday morning, thieves raised $26.750 from Brink's employee, who charged a bankomat in Levi's Newport, made it clear by a press release of the NYPD in Newport.
The car driver emptied the bankomat in the entertainment complex and prepared to load it with money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy in the message.

All those who have information about the suspects' identity must contact Newport police on phone 859-292-3680.
Kanius West: Raper changes his name to Ye
The Rapper Kanius West has changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change in Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Canye West.”
West, 41, has been wearing the nickname Ye for a while and used it as a title for his eighth album, which was issued in June.
The change precedes its appearance on Saturday Night Live, where it is expected to present its new album Yandhi.
He changes the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which has declined “for emotional reasons,” the Creator of the show tells us.
Except that it is a shortening of his current professional name, West has already claimed that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe that "ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means "you" or "vie", West said earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"This is how I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kaniah, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more like a reflection of our nature."
The rapper is one of the many famous in his fields who has changed his name.
Sean Kombs has a number of names and names, including Puff Dadi, Pi Didi or Didi, but this year he declared his preferences for the aliases of Lion and Brader Lion.
One of West's former associates, J.Z., was also represented in a version with or without tires and/or main letters in his nickname.
The President of Mexico swore not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore he would never use military force.
On Saturday at Tlatelko Plaza, President Lopez Obrador pledged "never to use the army to depress the Mexican people."
The soldiers fired against a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left political views gradually spread among Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and discovering more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States needs to double the financing of the II development
At the moment China becomes more active on the front of the development of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research budget in this area, says the researcher and developer of II Kai-Fu Loy, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment was made after various sounds from the US government made statements on the II theme, although the United States generally has no official strategy for the II.
During that time, China presented its plan last year: the country seeks to become number 1 from II by 2030.
"The double budget for the development of the II will be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the United States and they are about to make next breakthroughs with regard to the II," Lee says.
Double funding can also double the odds of the next major achievement in the II area to come from the United States, as Lee informed the CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of the II: China, the Silicone Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest II companies in China – Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellen Lee University, he worked on the II system, which defeated the most successful offender player in America, then he was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee pays the debt to the previous technological competitions of the federal government, for example the robotic competition of the Agency for Advanced Defense Research Projects, and asks when the next one will be helpful to identify new visionaries.
" US researchers often have to work hard to win government funding," pointed out Lee.
"No China takes away the academic leaders, but the corporations," the man claims.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technological companies hired university lamps to work on II.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy can help the United States to strengthen its II programme.
"I believe that II science doctors should automatically offer green cards," the man says.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop artificial intelligence from the next generation in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding for people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and Other State Organisations finance researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Leigh defines.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Centre for artificial intelligence, which aims to include partners from adults and academic environments, and the White House announced the formation of a Special Committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of 2 billion dollars in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million annually in the development of the II.
Meanwhile, the US legislature body, which wanted to set up the National Security Committee on artificial intelligence, has not marked any activity in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum whether to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether the country's name should change to the Republic of North Macedonia. This is a move that would resolve the ongoing decade dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is a area with the name Macedonia, claims her northern neighbour's name represents claims against its territorial integrity, which requires the veto of its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but the nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovenian majority of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he himself would not vote in the referendum, while his boycotting campaign casts a shadow of doubt whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 per cent required to recognise its validity.
The issue of the bills says: "Do you support NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the price is worth paying to achieve the entry of the established country of Yugoslavia in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," Olivera Georgievska, 79-year-old citizen of Skopje, said.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of the parliament have pronounced themselves to comply with the result of it to that extent that the vote already has a decisive burden.
In order to change the name of the state, two thirds of parliamentary representatives should therefore vote.
The State Election Commission announced that until 1 afternoon there were no irregularities reports.
However, the electoral activity was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of registered voters visited the urine.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjoze Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen of the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Duško voted in Macedonia's referendum on changing the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of Skopje's parliament, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and arranged chairs in front of tents held by the boycotting referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proudly raised heads, not through the servants' gate," Kavadarkov said.
"Our state may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Euroasiatic Union."
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us because more than 80% of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after playing their own vote.
The State has also said that the positive result will lead to "confirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published results from a study, according to which between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum – which is under the necessary activity.
Another study, the case of Macedonian Television Thelma, announced that 57% of respondents are planning to vote on Sunday.
70% said they would vote with "yes".
In order for the referendum to be successful, electoral activity must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow against the pro-Western government policy since it won power in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City goes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheim Sterling overcome the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City's victory with 2-0 on Saturday at Ethihad Steideum in Manchester, England.
Playing Aguero for his naked in 65 minutes seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentine Golmaister was found with a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran three Brighton defenders before sprinting the ball in the empty space ahead.
Then Aguero ended up surrounded by four green players.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left behind the rest at the border of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he passed left to Sterling.
The English assailant with one touch brought the ball back to Aguero, who with a right leg hit the doorman of Brighton Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his door.
"Aguero is fighting some contusions in his feet," City Pep Guardiola's manager told reporters.
"We planned to play him for about 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky you scored naked at this point."
But Sterling was the one who provided the original advance of “the heavenly blues” in this match from the High League of England.
He signed in 29 minutes.
In the naked Aguero situation, he got a deep pass in Brighton's half.
He immediately released a pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the far beam.
The attacker of "the heavenly blues" managed to detect closely, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a match from the group phase of the Championship League at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at Rain Nekar Arena in Xinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to play Definite the fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals didn't rank for the playoffs, there's no special purpose for another match of the title-starting player.
Yet still the ambitioned Shercer hopes to be a title on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, if the game is important to Rockies, who lead with one game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West classification.
Rockies guaranteed their participation in at least the Wild Card game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is still not certain that they will win their first title in the division.
"If we ourselves are not fighting for nothing, we want to finish the season with a nice match in Denver, where the audience and the other team will give their best in order to win perhaps the most important match for them in the year.
Why would I want to miss a match like that?"
Nationals haven't announced a launcher for Sunday, but they're supposed to let Shercer participate if the game is decisive.
For Shercer, this would be the 34th match as a launching pitcher this year, while he took practice on Thursday and would have the normal time to rest by Sunday.
The right-handed driver of Washington has a balance of 18-7 with 2,53 ERA and 300 strikewrights in 220 2/3 inings this season.
Trump collects supporters in West Virginia
President Koso pointed to the situation with his electorate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanau while talking about the importance of the Republican votes in the general elections.
"In November everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the greatest moments in the current history – I also say that although I am not a candidate, I am actually also participating, so I fight all the power for the right candidates," Trump said.
Then you continue with "Everyone sees this terrifying, terrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your eyes.
They are determined to regain their power in any way, you are witnesses of their infidelity, of wickedness.
They don't care when they can hurt who they have to run over to get caught in power and government, because they're interested in just power and government, but we won't give them."
Democrats, according to the president, have set their goal "to hinder and disrupt".
“What we all see in the last four days, ” he continued, calling the Democrats “anger, naughty, vicious and unfaithful. ”
The president reminded of the Senate Judicial Committee, mentioning the senator of Democracy, Diane Fainstein, in particular, which caused strong mob whistles.
"Remember her answer?
Did you spread the documents?
Please, what?
No, no, I've been waiting – that was a really bad gesture - maybe the worst I've ever seen."
Laborists are no longer widespread.
The party is not tolerant to those who speak openly
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I am just the last member of the Leaber Parliament for now, to whom it was said he was not welcome -- just because I speak sincerely.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar attitude, since he was decisively confronted with antisemitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironicly similar to those with which Jeremy expressed disagreement in the days of previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to include everyone and to be useful. ”
In most of my eight years as a local representative of the leaberists in parliament, Friday meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of "slower and measured" policy has long been forgotten if they have ever been on the agenda.
It became more obvious that different views were not tolerated in the leberist party and that every opinion was overestimated on the basis of how much it liked the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I used to think that they share similar political views began to expect me to make a turning turn and to take positions I would never agree with -- whether on the national security market or the single EU market.
Whenever I make public statements -- no matter what I say -- there is a whole mourning tyrade in social networks, where it is called for reply, rejection of moderate policy, applications that I do not belong to leaberists.
Like that, it doesn't just happen to me.
As a matter of fact, I know that I have even gained more luck than some of my colleagues, since the comments to me are at least most political.
I can only admire professionalism and the aim of these colleagues who face sexist or racist scams every day without fearing them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how similar insults have turned into normal.
Last week Jeremy Corbin said the leaberists should embrace culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is no longer widespread, with any sign of disrespect or change of choice rules getting tighter.
In the last two years, I have received a number of advice to keep my mouth shut, not to speak so much, and then “all will be well. ”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the leaborans 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Tacher government, which by neglecting it led to a literal dissolution of my excellent school, I fought for better public services for those who had the greatest need for them – whether as a local advisor or minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way from my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would like to say that when the state strives towards Brexit, it will damage households, businesses and public sectors, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Leaber head.
But really my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of the leabers, or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threats of responding or political cancellation will refuse to act in the way I consider the best in the protection of your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led to the ranking
The two late essays may have changed the light final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent High League.
The team already heads the ranking, and the only one of the ten teams is without loss until now.
Better protection and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the game, from which coach Peter Merci and his team can be very pleased.
"I am happy because other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past matches, and we are still without loss," Merci noted.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Air really took advantage of their situations better than us. ”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional blow from Frasier Climo, brought the Air forward as a result, but yellow chart for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the Waryers game, allowed Melrose to compensate in the result after Jason Baggot accomplished an essay followed by an unsuccessful supplementary blow.
Climo increased the advantage of Air from a penal blow just before halftime, marking an essay after a salt action, and then realizing the additional blow, making the result 17-5 for the Air of the Residency.
But Melrose started the second half well, and the essay of Patrick Anderson, followed by a successful additional blow of Bagot, reduced the advantage to only five points.
Following a long stop of the game due to a severe contusion of Ruarid Nott, which was carried out on a carrier, and after the renovation of the game Air increased their advance after the essay of Staford McDowall and a successful additional impact on Climo.
Then the active captain of Air Blair McFerson received a yellow chart and Melrose again took advantage of their numbered advantage by exercising strong pressure and realizing an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts returned their presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow chart after he knocked down Klimo without a ball, from the subsequent criminal act of McPherson carried out an essay with the help of the advanced offensive line of Air.
Air conditioning carried out the extra blow, and not long after he did it again, after Kyle Row caught the kicked ball from David Armstrong and took Gregor Henry's wing on the flag for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The Star of Still Game seems to be heading towards a new career in restaurant business
The star of Still Game Ford Kiernan seems to have headed towards a more direct and warm adult after it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC broadcast, which is also a writer and one of the two stars along with his long-term comedian partner Greg Hamfile.
The two announced that the upcoming nineth season will be the last for the show, as it appears Kiernan is already planning his life after Kreiglang.
According to official registers he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan had planned to join the "profound restaurant business" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": the lack of sea exit Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors keep patrolling the oxygens with sea headquarters in La Paz.
Above the public buildings are the ocean blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are loaded with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by law.
It's our duty to get it back."
In all the Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit delivered to Chili after the blood conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as well as the call to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
In fact, this hope is now the strongest since decades ago, while Bolivia awaits a conviction from the international court on 1 October, after five years of thinking.
"The power is in Bolivia, there is wind and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kalzadila said.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court's dedication on the big screen throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will support Bolivia's request and that after decades of negotiations, Chili will be obliged to give the Bolivian sovereign access to the ocean.
Here's Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is about to face a challenged fight for reelection in the next year, also put a lot and a lot on the judgment of the court on Monday.
"We are close to return our access to the Pacific Ocean," Morales promised last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of the court to make a decision in Bolivia's favor is quite small, even if it judges for her benefit, it would not change things in reality.
The UN's Netherlands body has no authority to take the territory of Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the conviction of the international court is only six months after hearing the latest arguments indicates that the case is "not complex", replies Paz Zarate, a chilian expert in international law.
And instead of contributing to Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have actually hurt her.
"The problem with access to the ocean was stirred by the current Bolivia government," Zarate said.
And then he suggested that Morales' military rhetoric has depicted the little one of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue at a time, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to conduct a normal dialogue.
Both countries have not held diplomatic missions in one another since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
According to him on Monday, Bolivia will have "the incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relationship with Chile", as well as the chance to "stop 139 years of disagreement by reaching benefits for both sides".
Calzadilla also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of accessing the ocean as a "political duck".
"Bolivia will never give up its right to exit the Pacific," he added.
"The conviction is an opportunity to see that we must overcome our past problems."
North Korea claims it will not continue with nuclear disarmment until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never take the nuclear disarm first, if he can't trust Washington.
Ri presented his speech Saturday to the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to comply with the promises they made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems on the edge of restarting the unexisting nuclear diplomacy for more than three months after meeting in Singapore with Kim Young Un of North Korea.
Ri called the "empty hope" the idea of continuing the sanctions and the opposition of the United States on a declaration that would end the Korean war would make the North fall on their knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the declaration without Phenyan first to make a significant gesture on the way of disarmament.
And Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that in Phenyan are serious about their refusal of arsenal, which they see as the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Phenyan next month to arrange the second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last scream on massive hats that will soon be in fashion shops next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun's beams, you don't need to look anymore.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown uncovered a gamma of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection, shining the fashion podium during the fashion week in Paris.
A lot of non-practical hats caused a wave in Instagram in the summer, when designers sent their stumbling eyes to make the community of fashion amazed.
Valentino's proposition was an extravagant fugitive hat with a similar feather wide periphery, which literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other enormous accessories included decorated with jewelry dines, magical hat and even a pineapple – but they do not aim to keep warm on your head.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – right in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not as much of the tall fashion as Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a diving equipment in a full set of shnorchel and glasses, while another looked like a melted cup of ice cream.
If you're into these fashion trends, you're lucky.
Modern specialists predict that huge hats will soon be sold in fashion shops near you.
The vast hats come shortly after La Bomb – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on the heads of everyone – from Riana to Emily Rataikovski..
The cult to an extremely non-practical hat that took over social networks led to the appearance of another huge design of the fashion floor – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the wearer wearing it with a costume model.
The raffy bag with the color of burnt orange, covered with raffy and tied with a white skin handle, was attracting all the views of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during the Week of fashion in Paris.
The stylelist of celebrities Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – after the designer has made such a great impression, it will be difficult to ignore the search for large accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential to global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic decoration, which continues in 2018 with another excellent performance of the test results, which is only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sport disciplines, art, music and other public sciences.
With up to 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scotland Association of Independent Schools (SCIS) are seeking to offer the best level of their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for their further education, their career chosen by them and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compile and bring into effect a personal school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to someone in an understanding language about him, your words can reach him.
But if you speak his own language, you touch his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build a relationship and trust with the nations of other countries.
Through the results of this year's exams, we see that the languages are first with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved high grade A.
The data collected from 74 members in SCIS schools shows that 72% of students have achieved A in Chinese, with 72% of German students, 69% of French and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills, which will definitely require children and youth in the future.
Currently, languages as subject to free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural and mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) as in the programmes of independent schools and beyond them.
In 2014, the Commission for Employment and Labour Skills of the United Kingdom survey showed that, for reasons of the difficulty finding employees, 17% indicated insufficient language competences.
Consequently, the government of foreign languages becomes compulsory to prepare young people for their future careers.
More working positions require the rule of foreign language, which transforms these skills into an essential globalised world.
Regardless of the career chosen, if a man manages a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future after having such a skill that remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the ruler several languages a person of one breasts ahead of competition.
According to the YouGov study, more than 4000 full-age citizens of the United Kingdom in 2013 did not rule foreign language well enough to be able to carry out a language, while French was the only language whose rule reached a two-digit percentage with a 15% indicator.
That is why investing in learning languages today is important to children now.
The rule of several languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children a better chance to find a good job.
In Scotland, every school will differ from languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important to the United Kingdom in the future plan of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child has, there will always be enough languages to choose in independent schools, while teachers will be specialists in their area.
Independent schools in Scotland are firmly determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, regardless of what the future hides.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country which requires that this be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien only faire.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools
Lebron's gonna make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting is almost over for the fans who are eager to see Lebron James' first match with the Los Angeles Lakes team.
Lakers' coach Luke Walton announced that James will take part in the first match of the pre-sexual preparation team against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it's still not clear how many minutes he's going to play in a fight.
"It will be on the ground between one and 48 minutes," the joke Walton announced through Lakers' official website.
The Lakers Reporter Mike Trudell announced in Tweeter that James would probably play relatively few minutes in the game.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans about the six matches from Lakers' pre-sexual preparation.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need pre-seasonal matches to prepare for the new season," he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of election rallys tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned Trump rallys that include stops in famous places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing the vote for its election to fill the seat in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to support the upcoming elections in the middle of the mandate, as the Republicans are threatened to lose control over the Congress during the submission of the votes in November.
What time will Trump's rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is planned for 19 hours, east time tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below by broadcasting live in YouTube.
Trump is likely to review the hearings this week on the nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh, in which tensions emerged due to claims of immoral sexual action, which holds the Senate's confirmative vote until a week until the FBI investigation is under way.
The main objective of this series of rally, however, is to help Republicans collect inertia for November's elections.
Therefore, in President Donald Trump's campaign, it was announced that these five rally next week aims to "activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of Congress is so important for his programme that the president will visit as many states as possible and start a campaign season full of commitments," Reuters spokesman of Trump's campaign, who refuses to be mentioned.
The rally tonight, planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wieling, could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract media attention from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump's second visit will be held this month in West Virginia – a country in which he won with more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Republican Patrick Morrisi, who is missing in sociological studies.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisi the fact that the president has come to give him a push in sociological studies," said Simon Heather, a polytologist from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
“Ryder Cost” 2018: The US team will fight to the last by maintaining its hopes alive before the singles on Sunday
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue "foursom" matches on Sunday afternoon, they may have brought what Raider bought needed.
A change of advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, however, in which players believe unresistantly, even more in competitions like this.
So what team is in a better position right now?
"They ran six points, and now there are only four, so I guess we picked up some inertion," Jordan Spit said at the end of today's race day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points at only twelve more to distribute.
However, as Spit says, the Americans have more to show, and their fans should not lose hope if we have to judge the sports form of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them took three of four possible points.
Spit shows an excellent form from the beginning to the end of every hole and is the true leader of his team.
The encouraging attitudes of fans became stronger while he advanced in the round, in which with a precise blow he balanced the result in the fourth match, after together with Thomas missed two punches after the first two holes.
His blow, which won their 15th hole match, was welcomed by strong enthusiastic reactions, which make us believe that it really wasn't all lost to the American team.
"The important thing is not to think about anything else and focus on your own game," Spit says.
That's all that's left of these players now.
18 holes to be remembered.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the uncontroversial heroes of Raider expensive so far.
The strange, but delightful couple from Europe won four out of four and they seem to have everything.
Molliwood were the only couple who didn't make "gods" on Sunday afternoon, but they also didn't have "richs" or Saturday morning, or Friday afternoon or morning.
These successes, as well as the way it seemed to pass energy between them and enthusiastic fans, have confirmed that they are the players that will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring Europe's potential victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National.
Preferably both in different holes at the same time.
But the stories of European glory proved to be a little premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of Fourball matches in the morning, while he partnered with Alex Norren.
"Godie" and two "bubbles" of the first nine holes put the Spanish and the Swedish into problems that they failed to cope with.
In Sunday matches, however, there is no way anyone else can solve your problems.
"Fourball" and "foursom" matches are extremely interesting to look closely because of the interactions between couples, the tips that exchange each other, and the way a strategy can take changes at any time.
The Europeans played better teams and therefore gained a significant advantage before the last day, but this "foursom" session showed that the American team was also willing to fight to the end -- something many people, especially in the United States, had strong doubts.
Europe leads with 10-6 on the last day of Raider Cup.
Europe will have a solid head start before the last day of Ryder expensive, after taking the United States with 10-6 after playing Fourball and Foursom matches on Saturday.
The inspiring duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the unconvincing Tiger Woods, with which their asset in the Le Golf National competition grew to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy that lost Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn dominated in the morning football matches over Americans who made mistakes after mistake, and eventually Europe won the 3-1 series.
The United States has shown more resistance in Foursom matches where they won two victories, but they have not been able to reduce the difference.
Jim Furik's team needs 8 points from the 12 single matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Flitwood is the first rookie in Europe to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as Molliwood, after this sensation weekend, became only the second couple who won four points from its first four matches in Ryder's history, expensive.
Since Woods and Patrick Reed were in the Football matches without an appetite, they were extremely motivated to defeat the broken Woods and the US rookie Bryson Declambu with even more categorical result of 5&4.
Woods, who barely went through his two Saturday matches, only from time to time demonstrated the outbreaks of his genius, but so far there are 19 losses from 29 Fourball and Foursum matches, as well as seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, got a break for the morning "football" matches, partnered with Henry Stanson in a "foursom" collision in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Копka -- number one and number three in the world.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, chilling and cloudy day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas regained the hopes of the Americans by winning two points on Saturday.
They reached a difficult victory with 2§1 against the Spanish John Ram and Jan Polter in Fourball matches, and later they returned to defeat Polter and Rory Macilroy with 4&3 in Foursom meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Scully, a team had to compensate for four points of deficit before singles, and according to the regulation, Furik's team would keep the trophy even in equality.
However, since they were raised in two consecutive days, their chances of a turn on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea says "no way" to disarm unilaterally, without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continuing sanctions deepened the confidence of the United States and there is no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
At the annual general meeting of the Ri Yong-hou, Ri Young-hou said that the last year were taken “significant measures of goodwill”, for example, we stop nuclear and missile tests, destroy the nuclear testing site and promises not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"In spite of that, we do not see an appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security and under no circumstances there is a way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri expressed the known complaints of North Korea for Washington's resistance against a "softest" approach to removing the nuclear weapon, in which North Korea would be rewarded, since she took steps, his statement seemed considerable because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Phenjan did in the past.
Ri called on a joint statement by Kim Chen Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US President and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim promised to work for "nuclear disarmment of the Korean peninsula", and Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea seeks to officially end the Korean war from 1950-1953, but from the United States, Phenyan must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls to relieve strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists "to first remove nuclear weapons" and increase pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal by force, and even object to "the declaration of end of the war," Ri said.
"The idea that sanctions can make us fall down on our knees is a meaningless dream of those who don't know us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions deepen our lack of confidence."
Ri did not mention whether the second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the US leader stressed during the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister focused on the three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Mun-In in the last five months and added: “If the country on nuclear disarmment was South Korea, not the United States, the removal of the nuclear weapons of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a stall.
However, the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from the previous year, when he told the UN general meeting that directing North Korean missiles to the continental part of the United States was inevitable after "the evil president" Trump called Kim "human-racket" on a suicide mission.
This year in the UN, Trump, who threatened North Korea last year with "full destruction", praised Kim for his courage to take disarmment measures, but said there is still much work to do and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea removes nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump stressed that there is no deadline for this and said, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Phenyan for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue without delay until complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council unanimously strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop the financing of the nuclear programme and Phenian's ballistic missile programme.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly Culturals and then said he would visit Phenyan again next month to prepare a second summit.
This year Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Phenyan in July with the words that progress was made, but only after a few hours, North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States took "the appropriate measures".
According to him, Kim told him that "the appropriate measures" to which he pursued are security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve normalisation of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard on course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to cope with growing culture for learning "all night" with caffeine.
A lecturer found that students at university number one in the world often do not even think about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kylesler, a medical professor at the Harvard Medical College and a specialist in the Brigam Hospital and a women hospital, prepared a course he believes to be the first in his family in the United States.
He was inspired to begin his course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“ Finally, a girl came to me and said: “Why are they telling me this just now, in my last year? ”
She said no one ever spoke to her about the importance of the dream, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important about how good sleep habits help the academic and sports achievements, as well as improving the common well-being.
Paul Barreira, a psychiatrist professor at Harvard Medical Faculty and the CEO of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffer from a serious lack of sleep in the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dorm where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, pawns and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports achievements affect the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the bed routine.
In another part, participants are told that long-term deprivation of sleep can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the effects on health from the choice to smoke," Professor Kaisler added.
The culture of pride from "the whole night study" still exists, he said, adding that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that deprivation of sleep is an increasing problem.
The provision of sufficient and quality sleep must be the "secret weapon" of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says -- even in order to avoid filling, since deprivation of sleep brings the brain into a hunger regime, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old college student from California, who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kylesler prepare the course by taking one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He says that his course had “opened his eyes ” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It hopes that the next step is all graduate students to be asked to complete such a school program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Kylesler recommends students to think whether to set up the bed alarm and to wake up and know the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by the electronic screens and the lightlight that can upset the circus rhythm and lead to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goal crushed Gerard's team
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's kick broke Steven Gerard's homeless team and brought a 1-0 win for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record his first victory as a triumph guest in February with 4-1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only brought Gerard's second defeat in his 18-year game as manager, which left his team eight points less than Hart's cut off team, head of the Ladbrokes High League.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the deprived of constructive ideas the Rangers team at no time seemed near to a match.
After the Rangers match, they stripped in the sixth place, and Livingston is already third, leaving the second Hibernian only in the naked difference.
For the Rangers there may be further problems, since the side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after he was hit by an object that was obviously thrown by guest fans.
Gerard made eight changes in the team that smashed Air in the semifinals of the League of Scotland.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven of Livingston who pulled a point against Harts last week, and he should be pleased with the way his aggressive team coupled all the opponents' actions.
The Rangers may have dominated the rule of the ball, but Livingston did better in the fewer cases when they owned it.
They had to mark at the second minute when Menga took Scott Pittman's touch against the doorman Alan McGreeger, but the half-protector missed the good opportunity.
Later, the centre of Kigan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halckett from the foul, but his partner in defense Alan Litgow pulled the ball off the back beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but they couldn't create anything containing in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought there should be a jaw in the 15th minute when he encountered Stephen Lawles, but referee Stephen Thompson rejected the claim of the Colombian.
Rangers only hit two exact strikes in the first half, but the former doorman of Ibrox Liam Kelly dealt easily with the head of Lasana Culibali and the weak shot of these Ejarias.
Although Levy's hit in the 34th minute was surprising to the property of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs' deep center again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher turned the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-bloodedly handed to Menga, who was easy to realise.
Gerard reacted to the holiday by changing Culibali with Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately resulted when the wing passed to Morelos, but impressive Kelly came out decisively and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play a comfortable game style for hosts, such as Litgow and Halckett constantly refusing the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased its head in the last few minutes, but McGregor managed to deal with Jacobs' blow, and next corner Litgow shot his head by the beam.
They came in as Glenn Middleton's Reserve from the Rangers asked for a dime at the end of the fight after unity with Jacobs, but Thompson didn't see anything wrong again in the situation.
Anniversary: Gaiger counter inventor
Page from our anniversary Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and BROENE... the day on which the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Gaiger was born in Germany.
Gaiger develops a method of detection and measurement of radioactiveness, invention which ultimately leads to the creation of the device known as the Gaiger counter.
The coronary stone in science from then on, the Gaiger counter also turned into a cornerstone of pop culture, when the 1950 film "The Coronado Campaigns", in which appeared the amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, for example uranium.

A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new vaccine against cancer can train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify foreign cells as part of treatment
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory
Then they can “see” protein, which is common for many types of cancer and are injected again in the patient
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer diseases.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them into a laboratory so that they can “see” protein common for many types of cancer called HER2, and then inject again in the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofski of the US National Oncology Institute in Betezda, Maryland: “The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine. ”
HER2 “stimulates growth of several types of cancer” including breasts, ovaries, lungs and colonectal cancer, explains Professor Berzofski.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and ‘training’ how to direct cancer cells was used in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kenny West made a speech in support of Trump, wearing a hat with a "Let's make America great again" in his participation in SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a pointless performance, commending US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After fulfilling his third song for the evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Let us make America great again," he declared himself against the Democrats and said his support for Trump.
“ I often talk to white people and they ask me, “How can you like Trump, he is a racist? ”
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's involvement, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavana's testimony to the Senate Legal Commission for Sexual Violence complaints made by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the recording of West's performance was uploaded into social networks by comic book Chris Rock.
It's not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
West also complained to the audience that he had problems behind the towers because of his hat.
"I was tormoured behind the towers.
They said to me, "Don't go out with that hat."
I've been tortured!
And then they claim I'm on a floating ship," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Do you want to see the floating ship?”, claiming that he will wear Superman’s costume, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Try with love."
The comments caused at least two whistles from the audience and the members of the SNL team seemed embarrassed, Variety said, saying one of them, "The whole studio shut up."
West was invited at the last minute to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, Raper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has confused many by performing the song “I love it”, dressed as a bottle of “Perie”.
West received the support of the head of the TPUSA conservative group, Kandez Turner, who wrote in Twitter: "On one of the bravest: thank you, that you faced the mob."
However, Karen Hunter's leading current show wrote in Twitter that West was just "he was himself and that's wonderful."
"But I choose not to reward a person (when I buy music or his clothing or support his art), who I think he welcomes and distributes ideology that is worthy of society.
He's free.
That's what we are," she added.
Before the show, the rapper reported on Twitter that he changed his name, and now "he is officially known as Kenny West."
He's not the first artist to change his name, and he's following the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and PiDi.
His friend, Raper Snoop Dog, was called Snoop Lyon, and the music legend Prince changed his name with a symbol.
An accusation of attempted murder after smashing a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.

The star of the Game A Thrones is against toxic maleity
Keith Harrington is famous for the role of the swinging sword John Snow in a violent medieval fentuses series of NGOs "The Game of thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor declared himself against the macho hero stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen often makes young people think that they should be "sophisticated" to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes that "something has gone wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic maleity in #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner from the Throne Game, Rose Leslie, also at 31, admits that he feels “confidentially convinced ” that this problem should be resolved.
"I am personally convinced - what have we misunderstood about manhood?" he said.
"What do we learn from adults about the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television may partly be responsible for increasing toxic maleity due to many male personalities.
He continued: “What is congenital, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street, which makes the boys feel they have to become this specific type of men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
'Cause obviously something's wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in the pre history or extensions of the Game of thrones after the end of the next summer's series, claiming that he had “finished the battlefields and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play part in the restoration of Sam Shepherd's Real West, a story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor said dating his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened in The Game of thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so this way he gave me my future family and identified my life in advance," he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl in which Keith John Snow's hero falls in love, in a fantasy show, the winner of the Amy Prize.
The two married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's house in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services in the country, more than 820 000 people have been affected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases are caused by sexual contacts, which points to a change compared to the past.
Traditional HIV is rapidly spread to some parts of China as a result of the blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced almost to zero, China's health services said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the community of LGBT in China.
In 1997 homosexuality was decriminated in China, but discrimination against people in the KGBT communities has been widespread.
According to studies, 70-90% of men who have had sexual contact with men are eventually married to women.
Many of the cases of transmission of diseases are due to wrong protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking data from the Republican Party, pledges "dangerous lies" and "theories of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the US Chamber of Representatives Maxin Waters sentenced the charges that a member of her team had published personal information to three US senators from the Republicans on the websites of the lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles said the claims were made by experts and websites of the ultra-right wing.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Watters said in a statement in Twitter.
The published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of US senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during the hearing of the Senate's composition on charges of immoral sexual behavior against the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavanau.
The leak was made after the three senators questioned Kavanau.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address, which identified the source of publications, was connected to the Watters' office, and posted information on a member of her team, according to Hill.
"This unfounded claim is completely unfair and is an absolute lie," said Waters.
“The member of my team – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these deceived and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely unfair and is an absolute lie."
The statement of Waters quickly triggered criticism online, including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Flaischer.
"There is anger in this denial," wrote Flaischer.
"This suggests that it has no temperament suitable for a member of the Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't get angry.
He doesn't have to act challenging.
I should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and balanced."
Flysher compared Watters' reaction to the criticism by Judge Cavanaugh's Democrats, who was accused of being angry during his hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the post of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"As a matter of fact, if it is true," he wrote.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had seized the proper authorities and the law enforcement authorities for these deceived allegations.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered," she continued, "and that they will be subjected to legal responsibility for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team."
Johnny English Review Explodes again – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British film, and it seems that this is also relevant to the restoration of action-comedies, spy franchise for Johnny English -- which started in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will the self-laughing and the mimic that speaks how obvious it is that we are stupid will become a new opportunity to export the nation?
In any case, incompetent Johnnie English with his eye and a "gummy" person has the permission to rebuild things for the second time – his name is most important when it comes to a big comedy creation designed for non-english admirers.
He, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange claim for flattering glare, owns a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean and a large part of the person who contributed with a note on the music theme Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
In addition, it was initially based on the abandoning chaos behind it by a traveler and an international man that Atkinson played in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
In the last movie with Johnny English, there are or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and for a while, the feathers stumbled in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy and obvious, but humor is quite weak and strangely exhausted, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems more directed to children, not to adults, and Johnny English's crazy accidents are not innovative and focused, since there is no Actinson game reminding Mr. Bean.
The current assumption is that Britain is facing serious problems.
Cyberhacker hacked the British super-secret network of spies and discovered the identity of all the operatives for the horror of the duty agent – unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is a high and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political inpopularity: Emma Thompson gives herself everything for this quasi-Tereza-May role, but in the scenario there is nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that she has to call a retired agent because all active agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a schicotic center, who illegally teaches lessons how to be a undercover agent: there are some good shots here when English regains a spy rock academy.
Inglish was called to Whitehall for an emergency instruction and reassociated with his former long-time assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is now a family man married to a commander of a submarine, a joyful role, in which Vicky Pepperdin's talent is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back in the game to resolve the great problems of her Majesty's secret service and face the fatal beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of the charismatic technology billionaire, who claims he can solve British computer problems: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo start their Pharaoh odds: dressed as waiters, burnt up a French restaurant; they create chaos when they sneak into the luxurious yacht of Walta; and England challenges real anarchy when he tries to use the helmet for virtual reality to meet the interior of the Walta house.
All the smiles are certainly taken from the previous film, but since so sympathetic and buzzing, there's a lot more content here for children.
It's a lot of middle production.
Just like the other Johnny English movies I keep thinking: can the British film industry give Atkinson a role that fits his talent?
Lamberts deny that the British are developing a plan to work four days a week, but to get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbin's Laborist Party is considering a radical plan, according to which the British to work four weeks, but to get paid for five.
The party argues that it wants company heads to provide economies made through the revolutionary artificial intelligence (II) to workers by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but to receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "past" the economic programme and the party's plans to shake the country in favour of workers.
The four-day working week was approved by the Union's Congress as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A higher source from the Leaber Party said to The Sunday Times: “It is expected before the end of the year to be reported for a review of politics.
"It won't happen immediately, but the four-day working week is an endeavor that fits in the approach to rebalance the economy in favour of workers, as well as in the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Laborist Party will not be the first to have such an idea. The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its overall election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire leberist party.
Lambert spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not part of the party's policy, not considering it."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's leaber conference to reveal his vision of socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power back from "free directors" and "speculants" in comm services companies.
The plans of the Chancellor in shadow also mean that the current owners of the shares in the water companies may not receive all their shares, as the leiber government could impose "resistance" on the basis of established infringements.
In addition, he confirmed plans to put workers in the boards of companies and to create privatisation funds to transfer 10% of net capital to private employees who can raise annual dividends up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy spoke 60 minutes ago whether Cavanaugh's investigation by the FBI could change their minds.
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano delayed the final vote of his nomination for the Supreme Court with at least a week and questioned whether the findings of the Bureau could force some of the senators from the Republican Party to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent of 60 minutes Scott Pellie asked the senators from the Republican Party John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to his colleague than South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after that statement came out, and I asked him: “Have you done it? ”
He was decisive, decisive and unequivocable."
But Graham's voice seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Cavanaugh and to change that, it is necessary to shake the indictment," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically denied it," Graham added, addressing Christine Blacius Ford.
"And no one she mentioned but could confirm it.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen festival and does it even help to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a annual music event, which has an impressive composition of performers and performs also an impressive mission: the elimination of poverty around the world.
Now, in their seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great lawn in Central Park, which will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but will also be familiar with the true purpose of the event – the removal of exceptional poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global poverty project, an international protection group that hopes to remove poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (other than if you don't want to pay for the VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "actions" as voluntary participation, sending no email to the world leader, phone call or connection in other ways to help raise awareness about their goal of eliminating poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen 12 years before reaching his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genius way to be convinced to require action or is it just another case of so-called "clictivism" – people think they're doing something significant when they sign online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions ” from its supporters who insist on a number of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders declare commitments and policies equaling more than $37 billion, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, which have already been paid or collected at least 10 billion dollars.
The group believes that the funds provided have already been directly affected by nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include the "Mode of Nutrition", established in Britain, partnership between investors and contractors, "helping children to develop their full potential", which promises to provide Ruanda $35 million to help end the country's non-food posts after more than 4700 posts in Twitter from "ground citizens".
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn social injustice of non-food simply into a historical note," Ambassador of the Food Force Tracy Ulman told the live concert audience in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, which urge Britain to improve mothers and children's nutrition, the government has announced funding for the project, the Power of Food, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the CNRs on his website, asking, "Why do you think we can stop the exceptional poverty?"
Global citizen replied: This will be a long and difficult path – sometimes we will fail and fail again.
But just like the big movement for civil rights and against the apartment before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Janel Mona are just some of the performers of this year's New York event, which will lead to Debora-Li Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can use military forces to "block" and prevent energy exports – the Minister of Interior
Washington may, if necessary, flee to its marine forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering the markets, including the Middle East, revealed US Minister Ryan Zink, as Washington Examiner quoted.
Zink argues that Russia's engagement in Syria -- in particular, where it operates on an invitation to the legitimate government -- is a preexistent for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States can, through our marine forces, ensure that marine roads are open and if necessary, block them in order to ensure that energy products do not reach the market," he said.
Zink addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group with an ineffective purpose, which is represented as “the voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He was aimed at comparing Washington's approaches to deal with Russia and Iran, noting that they were the same.
"The economic option for Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuels," he said, while also defining Russia as "ponys with one number", with an economy that depends on excavable fuels.
The statements come at a time when Trump's administration is tasked with strengthening the export of liquid gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" pipeline project "North Stream 2", which, according to Trump, turns Berlin into a hostage.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-dollar pipeline of the North Stream 2 which will double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's zealous opposition to the project is simply dictated for economic reasons and is an example of unfaithful competition.
"I believe that we share the viewpoint, energy cannot be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russia's energy minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow during September.
The US position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading German organisation in industry, the Federation of German Industry (DBDI), urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country is involved in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of the German industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look" at the presidential bid in 2020, said Senator Massachusetts
The senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "see seriously" the bid for president after the elections.
During the city council in Holioke, Massachusetts Warren confirmed he was considering running.
"It is time in Washington to enter women and fix our broken government and this includes a woman on the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the candidateship for president."
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump during the city council, saying that he "is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I worry to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy," she said.
Warren was sincere in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh.
In a post in Twitter on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
A social study conducted on Thursday, however, showed that most of Warren's voters do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "possible" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this bid.
The sociological study has shown more support for the bid for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent and 48 per cent against.
Other senior representatives of the Democratic Party, discussed as regards potential candidateship in 2020, include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump's rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after the entry in September.
He was arrested and accused of an accident of domestic violence Monday night
"What my own son is going through after he returned is known to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are coming home," she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "a loft in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they return a little changed, they step back, they come back and wonder if they will get that respect, which they and their brothers in arms have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Vasila, Aljaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, it was included in a report on domestic violence and possession of guns in untreased state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman of Vasila's police administration.
18 Country and District of Colombia support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the judiciary of a new US policy, which refuses shelter for victims of gangster and domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of the 18-state and county filed a good will in Washington in support of asylum seekers and contesting politics, NBC News reported.
The whole name of the prosecution on the Grayes v. Sesions case was not revealed, which the US Civil Liberties Union submitted against the federal policy in August.
She argues that her partner "and the sons of the violent members of his gang" abused her, but the US officials rejected the asylum request on July 20th.
She's been held in Texas.
US lawyers who are helping Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of candidates for asylum in the United States, such as nations facing extensive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The US new asylum policy has returned the decision of the 2014 appealing council of immigrants, allowing immigrants to run from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Colombia District lawyer Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined in accordance with specific facts and circumstances and such a ban violates this principle," the goodwill report said.
Furthermore, lawyers argue in the report that a policy that refuses immigrants damages the US economy, pointing out that it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary working hand".
In June, chief prosecutor Jeff Sesions ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelters to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gangster violence.
"The refuge is given to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or political beliefs," Sesions said in his 11 July report on politics.
The refuge was never meant to relieve all problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, everywhere in the world.
Desperate efforts to save in Palu, while deaths are doubled during the search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting harder.
"I feel very intense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her sick boy in an evacuated town center in Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
Clean water is thin."
The inhabitants have been spotted to return to their ruined homes to try to save something from their flooded goods.
Hundreds of people have been wounded, and the hospitals damaged by the earthquake with magnet 7,5 are overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dvi Harris, who suffered a break in the spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open due to continued secondary earthquakes.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the cruel earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed in the devastated wall," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he came to town with the family to attend the wedding.
"I heard my wife yelling for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "tormoz" with "propagand ads"
One week after the official newspaper in China published a four-page commercial in the US daily on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press for spreading propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump called on China Daily's paid publication in Des Moines Register – the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of seeking to intervene in the elections for the US Congress on November 6th. The accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Pecky is trying to intervene the elections for the US congress has noted what US officials told Reuters that it is a new phase in Washington's escalation campaign to push China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to launch commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently taking part in an escalating trade war that compensates import tariffs between countries.
According to US and China experts at the beginning of the trade war, customs tariffs in China were intended to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa, who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and Iowa's former long-term governor, the main agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing has deprived US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brandstad writes in a comment in the weekly number of Des Moines register, “at the moment it doubles this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press”.
"In the spread of its propaganda, the Government of China has taken advantage of the respected tradition in America for freedom of speech and press by putting paid advertising in Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"Apart from that, on a newspaper stand down the street here, in Beijing, you will find limited statements and you will not see a real reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have in terms of the disturbing economic trajectory of China, given that the media are under strict control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He adds that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the proposal to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
With Cavanaugh's devastation, the Republicans reject women's voters for the elections, analysts warn
Since many high-level Republicans stand behind and defend nominations for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavanaugh on several charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that there would be a repercussion, in particular women, during the upcoming elections.
Emotions around the tava are extremely strong and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue with the vote.
These things cannot be brought back," Grant Raher, professor of politics at Maxwell University in Syracuse, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he suspected that the last moment of Senator Jeff Flake's inquiry from the FBI would be sufficient to calm down the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the Modeon progressive group on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters scanned "November is coming!" during a demonstration in the Senate corridor, as the Republicans who control the judiciary decided to continue with Cavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacius Ford, Mic said.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded," Stu Rotenberg, an unparty political analyst, told the news.
"People say the problem is already serious; that is true.
But it can become more serious, especially among the voters, women in the suburbs and younger voters, between 18 and 29 years, who often do not vote because they do not like the president."
Even before Ford's public witness testimony, describing its charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominations, analysts suggest that it could follow a retaliation if the Republicans insist on confirming the bid.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former president of the National Committee of the Republican Party, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not only about the vote of the committee, the final vote or whether Kavano is placed on the stage. It is about how the Republicans deal with it and how they treat it," Gai Sesil, director of the Priorities United States, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, the Americans seem kind of divided on who to believe in the result of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, a little more branching to the second.
A new YouGov sociological study shows that 41 percent of responders are definitely or likely to believe Ford's testimony, and 35% say that they definitely or probably believe Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30% claim to Ford.
After Fleke's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Court of Justice that Kavano attacked her in a state of illness when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genitals in front of her while they were at a party during her follow-up in Yale in the '80s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web Team Berners-Lee starts a business that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the legend in the field of technology, Inrupt, is a company that builds the platform with the open code of Berners-Li Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and who people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company Berners-Leigh, it was a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is "the world domination".
"We must do it now," he said in terms of the business.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “online storage of personal data” or POD.
It contains lists, lists of tasks, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
Looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify that are available through each browser, and at the same time all of them at the same time.
The unique in the online storage of personal data is that the user determines who has access to information.
The company calls it "assigning personal data powers."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Leigh, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers, concluded a contract on the project, and a group of volunteers programmers.
Since this week, developers of technology around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a full change, or not, when all their business models are fully updated for one night.
"We do not want permission from them."
In a publication in the Medium on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that the Inrupt mission was to provide energy for trade and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet when he created a World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technical Institute.
In recent months, Berners-Leigh has had a strong influence in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although Inrupt is launched, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era on the Internet," Berners-Leigh added.
Bernard Van: in the memory of the priest who was worthy of the cross of Victoria in the First World War I
It has been recorded for 100 years in the hometown of the only english priest who has been awarded the cross of Victoria for his involvement in the battle operations in the First World War.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper without knowing that he was honored by Britain's highest military honours.
A memorial monument was discovered on Saturday by his two grandchildren, at a parade in Rushden, Northtonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "extremely symbolic" for the monument to be discovered for exactly 100 years from his grandfather's work assigned by a medal.
According to London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire of artillery and machinery."
Later, he attacked the fiery line, and with “incredibly courage ” he took the construction forward before he attacked an artillery weapon with one hand and killed three of the squads.
Lieutenant Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4th, 1918 -- just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions are “something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, placed a wreath after a parade led by "Brentwood Imperial Youth Band".
Michael Van said it was a "great honor to participate in a parade" and added "the strength of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can't become witnesses of the main event.
The San Jose programme contained 13 fights, including six of the main map and had to be broadcast live at night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock, just when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the viewers in Britain remained stunned when the transmission changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after they were up until the early hours, especially due to the fight.
The fan described Twitter switching the child's cartoon as a "some kind of sick joke".
"The government regulates that at 6 o'clock this content is not appropriate, so the programme has been changed by child broadcasting," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications of Bellator, in response to the issue of broadcasting.
"Peppa pig," yes.
The president of Bellator Scott Cocker said they would work on planning meetings to include British viewers in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repeats, we can solve the problem," Cocker said.
"But there is six in the morning on Sunday and there is no way to plan things so that the event will be held here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we got a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But he wasn't like that. He was governmental.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we do normally. We tried to give ourselves more to fans, but we overreached.
This is an unpleasant situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt "nissh" because of his sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daily says he's grown up, feeling less than anyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started studying in high school, he didn't realize that "not everyone is like me."
In an interview for the first edition of Dessert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he spoke of gay rights to give “nade” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to be less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The permanent leader of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, is in hospital for a few months.
In his first program of Lavern Daily, he said that he felt "less" than everyone else growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like girls, and boys."
He said: “To date, the feeling of minority and that I am different from others are actually the things that give me energy and power to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove it was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when he finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic Bronze Medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used its participation in this year's British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he is happy that he can live openly, without consequences and wants to inspire “the hope ” of others.
The threefold world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- was "surprised."
Daily married Oscar's carrier, who was 20 years older than him last year, but claims the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you go through so much while you're so young," he first participated in the 14th Olympic Games, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, "it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar rises and falls."
The two became parents in June and they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daily himself says that his "full sight" has changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, I'd tell you I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was baptized by his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daily said that his father couldn't accept that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the Olympic Games in London in 2012 – since he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you wouldn't be with me, Dad, or in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at the moment that I knew he was dead, I finally admitted he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daily raced the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I've dreamt of this all my life -- jumping to the Olympic Games in front of the audience at home.
This also inspired the choice of his first song – “Proud” by Heather Smol – which accompanied him during his preparation for the Olympic Games and still makes him nervous.
Dessert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 p.m., British summer time.
Lost form Michelson stays on the raider's raid on Saturday
The American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th match at the Raider expensive, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be connected to failure.
Michelson, who took part in the two-year event for the record 12th time, was left on the stage by Captain Jim Furik for "fourball" and "foursom" matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-fold winner of big tournaments spent his day as a fan and in training his blows from a distance with the hope of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who even at the top of his career was never among the most justifiable players, is not in optimal form for the difficult playground of Le Golf National, where the long inequality field usually punishes every wrong blow.
And if the playground alone is not alarming enough, in the 9th Sunday match, Michelson will face the precise champion of British Open Francisco Molinari, who is in a team with the rookie Tommy Flitwood and seeks to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points before the 12 single matches, make a strong start, it might prove that Michaelson's game is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything much different.
"He fully understood his role today, struck my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Fame Hall and has given as much as in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected to play more, but it just worked out, and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everyone else."
Michelson will improve Nick Faldo's record for the largest matches in Raider Cup, played on Sunday.
This may end his career in Ryder expensive, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven equal matches, but Furik said his presence also brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by figures.
"He is a funny, sarcastic, sharp, likes to joke with people and is a great man for every team," he explained.
"I think the younger players also had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives much more than just to play."
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great front can soon be melted.
The captain of the team of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, knows from a personal experience that the great advantage accumulated before single matches from the last day of the Ryder expensive, can be easily erased.
The Danish man debuted in the game of Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros ran five points ahead of the Americans, but precisely on the final rights was almost overtaken and barely managed to hold the victory with 141.2-131.2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage of Valderrama; we had a great advantage of the Brookline, where we lost, and we won the Valderrama, but very hard," said Bjorn, after the 2018 team won 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday, taking with 10-6 of Le Golf National:
So the story has to show me and everyone in the team that it's not over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Come out and do what you have to do.
Nothing's over until you see the end result of the board.
We have a goal and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's exactly what we need to stay focused on.
All the time I've been saying that I'm only thinking about the 12 players in our team, but we're also aware of our rivals, who are the greatest players in the world."
Satisfactored by the presentation of players at a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow's gonna be different.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come out, and that's different.
It's great to be there with a partner when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you test your entire capacity as a golf player.
This is the message to the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your partner's back, as he must be given to the end."
Unlike Bjorn, the rival captain Jim Furik will ask his players to be better individually than as partners, such as exceptions are only Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these great reversal in the last day – he was part of the potato of the "Brookline", and then he was on the loser side when the Europeans committed the Medinah miracle.
"I remember every goddamn word," he said in answer to the question how Ben Krenshaw, the captain in 1999, led his players in the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but it would be good for you to do the same good start as you saw on "Brookline" as well as "Medinah".
When the advantage goes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are playing under tremendous tension.
That's why we formed our team and distributed our boys as we want to try to do the impossible tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to lead our counterattack and face Rory Macilroy in the most important game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Jan Polter will meet other Europeans in the upper half of the arrangement.
"I chose these players in this order because I think this gives us the greatest chance of success," Bjorn said about his choice for singels.
Germany postpones the launch of a new warship again
The latest fregate of the German fleet was to be implemented in 2014 in order to replace the aged warships from the Cold War time, but this will not happen at least until next year because of the irregular systems and the overwhelming costs, local media reported.
The introduction of Rheinland-Pdalz, the leading ship of the brand of new fregates from Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, quoted by the military spokesman.
The floating court had to join the marine forces in 2014, but the problems that emerged after his delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships from the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, ordered by the fleet in 2007, will replace the aged bremen fregates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of airborne and anti-powered missiles, as well as some stelt technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest fregates should be able to use for up to two years before returning to the ports of home.
Continuous delays, however, mean that the avanguard warships -- which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power beyond the ocean -- will already be old when they enter the operation, Die Zeit notes.
The misfortune fregate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to release the vessel in operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the fleet returns a ship to a shipbuilder after shipping.
It is little known for the reasons for return, but the German media quoted a number of essential "software and hardware defects", which make the military ship unusable if it was sent to a battle mission.
Software shortages are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg sailing vessels will be managed by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the crew of older fregates than the Bremen class.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was considerably overloaded, reducing its efficiency and limiting the possibility of the sea forces to add future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships of such a class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, also becomes a problem.
It is believed to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion) -- from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems with the latest fregates become particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's military forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defense Commission, admitted that the fleet is actually "exhausted from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The person of duty said that the problem has become greater in time since the old ships have been taken out of operation, but no new ones have been provided.
He complained that no frigate of the class Baden-Wuerttemberg could be involved in the fleet.
The national trust tracks the secret life of bats
A new survey conducted in a house in the Scottish mountains aims to determine how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hopes are that discoveries will cast a new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help in managing future conservation actions.
The study of scholars from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the frequently encountered bats, as well as brown water lounges in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key places in the house to track the activities of bats during the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
The expert audio analysis of all records will determine the frequency of the call sounds of the bats, as well as which types they publish.
Then a map of the habitat and report will be drawn up to create a detailed landscape of their behaviour.
Rob Djuar, a Nature Protection Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are the most important for bats and how they are used by all kinds.
This information will help to determine the benefits of land management work, e.g. the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and Britain generally decreased significantly in the past century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their refugees and lead to the loss of habitats.
The risk for populations may be of wind turbines and lighting, air conditioners and some chemical processing of construction materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, bats aren't blind.
However, because of their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight trajectory.
NTS, responsible for care for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The trust has trained experts who conduct regular studies, security inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even created the first in Scotland and the only special bat reserve in the Threave Estate in Dumphreys and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten types of bats in Scotland.
The Manager of the House David Thompson says it's a perfect territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, we have a great field for bats," he noted.
"We have old buildings, many adult trees and a complete suitable habitat.
But there are many other things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand better what they need to flourish."
It stresses that it is important to verify the presence of bats before the activities of maintenance of property are carried out, as an unwilling destruction of an asylum could kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy the entire local population.
The bats are a protected species and it's illegal to kill each other, harass, disturb or destroy their refugees.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee in the Trask to protect bats, encouraged society to help.
She said: “I still have much to learn about our bats and many of our species, since we just don’t know what happens to their populations. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims, and his lawyers will judge German magazine
Christiano Ronaldo described the rape claims against him as "false news", saying people "wanted to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will be suing the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these statements.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then claimed to have paid $375 000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, addressing his 142 million followers, several hours after the publication of 33-year-old Ronald's statements, the publication was pronounced as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is false news," the five-fold Golden Ball carrier told the camera.
"They want to become famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to get popular on my back, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and it's all right," the football player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for claims that call "unfavourable publication of suspicions in the area of personal life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the football player would ask for compensation for "moral damages equivalent to the burden of the violation, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
It is said that the incident in question occurred in June 2009 in a flat in Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After they met in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went to the soccer room, where he claimed to have raped her anally, according to the documents submitted to the county court of Clarke in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told her he was a "good boy" at "99 percent", but in the case, he just slipped to the "one percentage".
According to the papers, Ronaldo confirmed they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Majorga also claimed that she went to the police and had taken pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she felt "scared of vengeance" and was worried that she would not "be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the agreement because she continues to live with the trauma of the incident.
During the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer moved to the Italian Grand Juventus for 100m euros.
Brexit: Britain "will regret it forever" for losing car manufacturers
Britain "will regret forever" if she loses her status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "disturbing" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they will temporarily stop production in their plant in Burnastone near Derbi.
"We need a deal," he said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the border delay in the case of Brexit without a deal could lead to loss of jobs.
In the Burnastone factory – where Auris and Avensis models are produced – nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory production will stop," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Burnastone.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, says they'll close their factory for the Mini model in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks of the supply chain in the case of Brexit without a deal.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle "tocally in time", as the units arrive every 37 minutes from both the UK and the EU for cars designed by order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a lack of parts.
Toyota would be impossible to wait for more than one day to fill their inventory at the Darbisher factory, said the company, and that's why the production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Teresa May's "schematic" plan for future intercourse with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only enjoy the current success, but we can grab this opportunity," he said in the 4's Program Today on BBC Radio.
"After the claims not only of Toyota, but also of other producers, we are absolutely convinced that we should continue to provide successful supply chains."
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but in a longer term they warn that additional costs will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and will ultimately lead to loss of jobs.
Peter Tswalaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite Union in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “I judge that if these jobs go away, they will never return.
The government spokesman said: "We have made an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU."
The meeting between Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, says the White House
The extremely important meeting between Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred with another week", as the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Cavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein watches the work of Special Advisor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trump's assistants and Russia and the potential obstacle to justice by the president.
This whether Trump will fire the deputy prosecutor, or not, will endanger Mueller's independence for months, feeding the rumors about Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times said Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record talks with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies that claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was in the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting was announced with him on Thursday.
Trump said he'd rather not fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing before the Senate's legal committee, which they witnessed both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment – Dr. Christine Blazy Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation by the FBI on the charges against Cavanaugh, further delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, showed up on Sunday on Fox News.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It is not yet a date for that, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening at the Supreme Court, I think it may be delayed for the next week.
But we'll see, and I'm always trying to keep the press informed."
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The lead on Chris Wallace's show asked about the reason.
Sanders replied that rare press conferences are not due to the inconvenience of the "demonstrative behavior" of TV journalists, although he said, "I cannot say that I disagree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
Then she suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more sessions with questions and answers from any president before him," she said, adding, without quoting evidence, "We checked these statistics."
There will still be press conferences, Sanders continued, but "if the press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you are witnesses to practice it quite often in recent weeks, and this will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Personal press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and sometimes strange behavior in front of the gathered journalists.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in Scotland's National Health Service as regards fears related to Brexit
The health minister has writtenly addressed the EU staff working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express the country's appreciation and the desire to remain in their seats after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter to less than six months left until Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to the costs of establishing EU citizens' status procedures working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Mrs Frieman wrote: “In the summer, the negotiations between Britain and the EU on leaving continued, and decisions are expected in this autumn.
But the UK government also advances in its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I'm sure this is a very insecure period for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, no matter what his nationality.
Companies from all over the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services work, and this is useful for patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is unconditionally your home and we would like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie had an emergency surgery after he had a head trauma.
Tennessee State Tigers, Christian Abercrombi, had an emergency operation after having a head trauma during a Saturday meeting, when his team lost from Vanderbilt Comodors with 31-27, Mike Organ from Tennessee reported.
Tennessee State's senior coach, Rod Reed, shared with reporters that the trauma happened just before the semi-time.
"He went to the sideline and somehow just fainted there," Reid said.
Coachs and medics handed oxygen to Abercrombs on the sideline before it was placed on a stretcher and was taken into the dressing rooms for further examination.
Tennessee State's official confirmed to Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie has left surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details of the type/serious trauma" and that Tennessee State is trying to understand when the trauma occurred.
Abercrombi, second-year college scholarship, is for the first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday he made a total of five blocks before leaving the game, which makes a total 18 blockage for him this season.
Foreign buyers will charge a higher counterfeit account when buying real estate in Britain
According to new conservators' plans, foreign buyers will charge a higher back account when buying real estate in Britain, with additional resources to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbin's efforts to attract young voters
Increasing in the back account will affect those who do not pay taxes in Britain
State Treasury expects an increase of more than 120 million British pounds per year, which will help homeless people
Teresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher back account when buying real estate in Britain, with additional revenues going to help homeless people.
This move will be viewed as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbin's efforts to attract young voters by promising more accessible housing and focusing on people with high income.
The increase in the back order will affect natural persons and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, with additional revenues, will help the government's efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current back account, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for the second housing and property purchased for the purpose of giving – may be up to three percent.
The state treasury expects the proceeds to increase by up to 120 million British pounds a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased from people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to a price increase and making it difficult for those who buy property for the first time to intervene in the property market.
Many of the wealthy areas -- especially in the capital -- have become "environmental cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy only appeared weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the back order to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices of property by robbing land, but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon the quotas for accessible housing to correct the "disgrace with the residences" of the UK.
Mr Corbin announced an attractive series of proposals for reforms for housing, including the control of rent and the end of the expulsions "without guilt".
He also wants to provide councils with greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. Mae said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as prime minister to restore the British dream – to make the life of every new generation better.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always have open doors for those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not proper for people who do not live in Britain, as well as foreign companies, to buy their homes as easily as the hard-working inhabitants of Britain.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has fared too far in time, and the depravity of sleeping on the street remains too realistic."
Jack Ross: “My final goal is to lead the Scotland team. ”
Sanderland Manager Jack Ross said "the greatest ambition" in his career was to be the senior coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman accepted the challenge of rebuilding the club from north-eastern England, which is currently in the third position in the First League, three points from the first place.
He passed the State of Light this summer after taking St. Miron back to the Scotland High League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded a match for the B team and that was all," Ross told the Scotland BBC Sportsound.
"But I grew up with the matches of the Scotland of Hampden, which we watched together as a child with my father, so the national team always attracted me.
"But this opportunity would only be opened if I had a success at a club level."
Among Ross's predecessors as Sanderland's managers are names like Dick Advocaate, David Moyce, Sam Allerdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Di Cannio.
Aloa Atletic's former teacher said he was not concerned as heir to such established names in such a famous club, and earlier he rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipsuic Town.
"For me, success will currently be measured with a positive answer to the question "Can I return this club to the High League?"
Because under the structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the High League," he said.
"It will not be easy to go back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months at Hart's coaching headquarters.
Then he helped Aloa not fall into the Third Division and turned St. Myron into a fallout team in Championship in the next season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his career as a football player in Clyde, Hartlipool, Falkhurk, St. Myron and Hamilton Academy.
"I was really at the crossroads," he remembers the time he took over Haloa.
"I really believed that being a manager was the best place for me, including before being an active player.
It sounds weird because I was doing good, making good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player sometimes is hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I'm still facing the same level of stress and pressure in my work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now that I really do, I've never felt more comfortable in my skin in my whole conscious life."

The perfect time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals a study
The summer heat increases the revenues of the fighters to survive the British pubs, but raises more tensions for chains of restaurants.
The groups of pubs and bars reported an increase in sales by 2.7 per cent in July, but the revenues in restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin from the business-consultant CGA, which compiled the statistics, said: “Because of the long solar time and longer than the expected participation of England in the World Championship, in July a similar model was followed as in June when the pubs reported growth by 2.8%, but restaurants received an even stronger impact.
The decline of 1.8% in restaurant business in June just deepened in July.
The pubs and the drink bars have seen the best results in their growth compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
The meals also suffered from the suntime, but not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In the pubs and bars, the sale of beverages went by 6.6 percent per month, while there was a 3% reduction in food."
Paul Newman, analysts of RSM rest and entertainment, said: “These results continue to be the trend we noticed in late April.
Time and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the service sector outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to suffer, although the decline in sales by 4.8% per year can be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not appear at a worse time for food managers and only time will show if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August would bring so much a desirable rest."
The overall growth in the sale in pubs and restaurants, including the newly discovered, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the delay in the spread of marks.
Coffer Peach Tracker, sales analyst in the pub sector, bars and restaurants in Britain, collects and analyses data for the implementation of 47 operational groups, with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds of British, and is a strong indicator in the grower.
One in five children hides a secret profile from their parents in social network
One in five children — some at only 11 – have a secret profile in social network that hides from their parents and teachers, revealed a study
Study conducted among 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
News has increased fears that material with sexual content is published
Twenty percent of students said they had a "elemental" profile showing their parents
One of five children — one in 11 — creates a profile in a social network that keeps secret from adults.
Study among 20,000 high school students shows growth in fake Insta accounts – reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
News has increased fears that material with sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a cleaned-up "the main" profile showing their parents, while they also have secret profiles.
A mother, who encountered the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter, found a teenager child who encouraged others to “rape him. ”
The study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors (HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 percent of children between 11 and 18 have two profiles, and half of them acknowledge that they keep their profiles secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It is anxious that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them. ”
Elyde Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in Scotland's Slight Athletics Board
Elyde Doyle was chosen to join the Slight Athletics Board in Scotland as director without executive functions at the annual general meeting of the governing authority.
Doyle is the slightest athletes of Scotland with the highest achievements and President Ian Beatty identified this move as a great opportunity for those leading to sport, to take advantage of its rich experience at international level in the last decade.
"Elyde enjoys great respect in the slightening communities of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the light athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from its attraction," Beati said.
Doyle said: “I want to be the athlete's voice and I hope I can really contribute and help promote sports in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the finals at 200 and 400 meters of the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, added to its four Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular commentator in BBC, lost the ability to walk after he received a transitional Islamic attack.
He wrote in Twitter: “A month ago I received a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time would show if I'd recover and how much.
It was exhausting work, but I've achieved a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I'm doing mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertisement for breast-feeding, which compares mothers to cows, separates online opinions
The company producing breast-feeding pumps separates online opinions with an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to cows who are breast-feeding.
To commemorate the placing on the market of the expected “first noiseless feeding pump in the world suitable for bearing”, the Elvie user technology company launched the joke musical-video commercial to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump provides the nursing girls to appear.
Four real mothers dance in a haywalk, full of hay, in the background of a song that includes: “Yes, I do, but you don’t see any tail” and“ If you haven’t noticed, it's not a vime, it's my breasts. ”
The suppression continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, eat your friends. ”
The commercial, however, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many suggested that it degraded “the horrors” of the milk processing industry.
"It is a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should become pregnant and be born to produce milk, but their babies take them a few days after birth," someone wrote.
Elvie breast-feeding pump is collected discreetly in breast-feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is fully understandable that it is traumatizing both for the mother and for the baby.
But, yeah, why don't we use them for an advertisement of a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: “So much inadequate advertising. ”
Others defended the ad, admitting that a woman views the song as “extremely fun. ”
"I think the idea is brilliant.
I'd buy one if I had more breast-feeding.
The draining made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is genius," someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny commercial focused on mothers who suck (often in their jobs or in the toilets) and feel like“ cows. ”
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the milk processing industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they danced with discreet pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on seeing that many women breast-feeding feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, no wires or pipes and gathers discreetly in the breastbuilding for nursing women, which allows the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they suck.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Creative Director in Mother, commented: “The pump Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a courageous and provocative release on the market.
With the drawing of parallel between the nursing and the dairy cows, we wanted to focus our attention on breast-feeding and all the challenges related to this, while showing the fun and understandable sense of freedom, which will bring the new pump.
This is not the first time Elvie pump falls into the leading news.
During the Week of Fashion in London, the mother of two children appeared on the stage for designer Martha Yakubovski using the product.
Hundreds of children of migrants have been moved secretly into a tent camp at the border with Texas.
The number of detained children of migrants jumped sharply, although monthly border crossing remains relatively unchanged, partly because the sharp rhetoric and politics of Trump's administration has difficulty setting up children with guardians.
Usually most guardians are immigrants without documents who fear that they risk their stay in the country if they want to recognize the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adults in the family should provide fingerprints, and these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of undeparted minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either guardians, or are members of the household of the guardians, are illegally staying in the country as a majority of them are foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these faces," Alberts said.
In their efforts to cope faster with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, not after 60 days, as the previous norm was, according to employees in the shelter.
Many appear in a video conference conversation, not personally, to present their legal status to an immigration judge.
Those identified as inappropriate for authorisation will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer the children remain detained, the more likely it is to become suppressed or depressed, which can lead to violent breakthroughs or attempts to escape, according to employees in the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing in large facilities, such as in Tornilo, where signs of a child having problems are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the site.
They added that moving children to the “pathic city, ” without giving them enough time to prepare at emotional level or farewell to their friends, may make it difficult for the trauma with which many are already fighting.
Syria insists the US, France, Turkey's "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the civil war lasts eight years.
Mualem, who also holds his post as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally residing on Syrian land under the anti-terrorism preference and "they will take the relevant action".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Mualem insisted that “the war against terror is almost over ” in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleansed" both by terrorist organisations and by "all illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 military officers in Syria, who are mainly training and advised both the Kurdish troops and the Syrians, the opposition of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the lands of the devastated country.
Regarding the refugees, Mualem said the conditions are proud and could return, accusing "some Western countries of "inflicting unfounded fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to cooperate for these returns," he said.
"They are turning into a political issue something that is a fully humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance for Syria's recovery until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to stop the war is reached.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large fortress of rebels in Idlib gives the opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevents a large-scale attack by Russian supporters of Syrian forces over the province where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military actions will be aimed at the jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda front Al Nusra, which will "be destroyed".
UN lawmakers Stefan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of the new committee, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draw up a draft of Syria's post-military constitution and to make way to elections.
Mualem explained the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "the review of the members of the current constitution" and warned there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win second term
According to this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020, unless -- as many liberal viewers are likely to hope -- his presidency will not be suspended prematurely because of impiechmental and scandal.
This would no doubt be "the most dramatic ending of the presidency ever!"
At the moment, there are no signs of the fatigue of the viewers.
Since 2014, the premium rating has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News have a mean 2.4 million viewers during the prime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the cable TV rating, with up to 3.5 million viewers on big news dinners.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it is something we don't understand," says Neil Baer, an executive producer of the ABC drama "The Last candidate", where it is told of the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack against Capitol.
Nel Skovel, who is a comedy veteran and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys” Club, has another theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before elections in 2016.
The taxi driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, "Why?"
Mrs. Skowell told me that he answered to her "Because she made me laugh."
There's fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else shown on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Row v. Wade, whether the families of immigrants can reconcile, as well as the good state of the world economy.
The exclusion is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged viewers.
However, the desire to be an informed citizen does not correspond to that at six hours to watch a group of experts discussing Bob Woodward, who uses “deep historical information” as a source of his book “Fare”; Paul Manafort’s pilot jacket from the noose skin for $15,000 (the clothing full of arrogance“ according to Washington Post), and the tremendous descriptions of Stormi Daniels on Mr Trump's anatomy.
I specifically will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"The honor of what he does to make you feel like a part of a reality show is to give you a little every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and Creator of the Pawn Stars, in terms of changing participants and daily turns (eating with the National Football League, praiseing Kim Chen Un).
You can't afford to miss one episode because you're gonna be late.
When I contacted Mr. Floyce this week, it was sunshine on the north coast of Kawai, 80 degrees, but he was closed home to watch MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
"I remember when we used to do all those crazy shows and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Investments involving the most disputed race in early elections in Congress
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania receives a flow of money, thanks to rearrangement of Congress districts and thereby two titles for the same place.
The recently redistributed district in Pittsburgh's suburbs points to the conservative Democrat Connor Lamb, who won his position from another district in partial elections last spring.
Lamb faces another title, the Republican Keith Rothfus, which is currently the old 12th county of Pennsylvania, which is significantly adhering to the new 17th.
The maps were rearranged after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ordered in January that the old districts were counter-constitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th county sparked the financial dispute between the main financing institutions of the parties, the Democratic Congress Committee on Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb was announced in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the March 18th congressional elections discussed.
The position was held by the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the county with 20 points.
Political experts believe the Democrats have little advantage.
The United States considered imposing sanctions on El Salvador for its support for China, and then retreated
Diplomatics note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already confessed to Beijing, with a little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heart attack with President Juan Carlos Varela from Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the management team of Trump Organization.
Representatives of the State Department have decided to respond to the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, due to "the recent decisions no longer to be recognised Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokesperson of the Department earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were envisaged against El Salvador, which in 2017 received around $ 140 million aid from America to combat drugs, with a view to developing and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cutting down financial assistance and target visa restrictions, would have been tortured for the Central America state with its unemployment and a percentage of homicides.
With the advancement of internal meetings, the officials of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic well-being, which serves to continue such a gathering last year, considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, the senior management authorities pointed out that their desire was to hold the conference, thus effectively suspending any sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pens announced that he will participate in the conference planned for the middle of October as a sign of the importance that the administration gives to the gathering, diplomats say.
The three US lawmakers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new strict messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, wishing to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst, close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next move may be the report of Special Advisor Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by Mr Trump, and the report is currently significant evidence in the public register.
Mr. Muller is claiming to direct his investigation and to whether Mr. Trump has conspired with Russia during his campaign in their attack on our elections.
If Congress's leadership changes, it will prove that Mr. Trump will have to be accounted for in front of this authority, just when he is preparing to face the voters, as well as perhaps the jury, made up of his colleagues.
There are many unknown here, and I do not suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable - neither is it of the likes of him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make these choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to make a state coup against Hitler, as long as the West had opposed him and supported the Czechoslovians in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the following years of the slaughter.
The walk of history depends on such anal moments, and the ungrateful march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now facing a few of these moments.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds in his hands the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to record the president secretly and speculate with the opinion that he was not suitable for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein announced that the story at the Times is incorrect.
"How would we react if the new investigation against Brett Cavanaugh, decreed by the FBI, is not complete or fair - or if it is approved to the Supreme Court despite the charges of sexual impression and false testimony?
And most of all, will we vote in early elections for Congress if this will force Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail in these trials, democracy awaits her for a long winter.
But I believe we won't fail because I took a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, immigrated in America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the candles for Shabat on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior associate of the Institute of Brooking, is chairman of the “Civil of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington”, and is the author of The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House.
Graham Dorrance of Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Vienna encounter.
Rapid Vienna's Rapid Vienna hosts on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians after the impressive equality in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to move forward from the G League Europe Group.
The contusion in the knees did not allow half-protector Graham Dorrance to play his first game for the season before the issue equality of 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes that for the Rangers this result could turn into a tramplen to greater achievements.
"We won an important point because Villareal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old football player.
"We entered the game with hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the game, but overall equality seems fair.
They were better in the first half, and we were in the second.
We took a look at Thursday, another big night from our matches in Europe.
I hope we can fight for the three points, this will be a hard game because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can give our best of ourselves and achieve a good result.
Last year was definitely hard after everything that happened by my contusions and the changes in the club, but now things seem to have worked in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys are really having fun, training is useful.
I hope we can integrate all the power to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women worry about fears about their pension savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what concerns they want to receive, few people discuss this with family members.
About half of the participants in Nationwide Study shared that they discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of them have talked to their children about this.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they have not taken steps to conduct this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance sector of Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your wife and children: You can't prepare your family to give you care if you don't say your wishes in advance.
Together with your adviser and your family, discuss where and how you want to get care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining the costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your counselor may also help you with the idea of how to pay these expenses.
Your decisions, when you choose a financial institution for long-term care, can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a mixed insurance policy "Life" with a monetary value to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your resources – if you have money resources.
Prepare your legal documents: deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Name yourself a healthcare provider, so that you have a trustee to oversee your medical care provided and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also consider the idea of a financial authority.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your accounts will be paid if you are incompetent.
Remember the small details: Imagine your parent needs emergency medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Explain these details in writing to be prepared.
"It's not just about the financial aspect, but also about who the doctors are," Martin asked.
"What are the drugs?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make up a plan."

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities announced as the number of dead is expected to grow.
Due to interrupted communications, the aid organisations cannot receive information from the Dongala Regent, a area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a magnetic magnitude of 7,5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulavesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesi province, located at the end of the narrow beach edge on the west coast of Sulavesi island, with a population of 379 800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit him.

Fishing and farming are the foundations of the province's central Sulavessi economy, especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nikel's gain is also important to the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
Palu and Dongala have been overwhelmed several times by tsunami over the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Agency for Recovery after disasters.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
Tsunami hit the west part of Dongala and in 1996, when nine people died.
Indonesia is located on the seismic “Tihookean Fire Ring” and is regularly soaked by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and wave tsunami in recent years:
2004: A strong concussion on December 26th on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra activated a wave of tsunami, which hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people across the coast of the Indian Ocean, as more than half of them are in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias near the coasts of Sumatra.

This time, tsunami has not been activated, but more than 100 people have been killed by devastated buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have mocked the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, more than 500 people died, most of which on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporaryly in an impasse.
Sarah Paylin's eldest son has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Track Paylin, the largest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of violence.
Paylin, 29-year-old, by Vasila, Alaska, was arrested for domestic violence suspects, interference in a notification of domestic violence and resistance in arrest, according to a report by the state police in Alaska published on Saturday.
According to a police report, when a woman-known woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.

Sarah Paylin was criticised by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died of an earthquake, which cut down the Indonesian island of Sulavezi on Friday.
The magnetic earthquake 7,5 caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication networks are disconnected, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit near central Sulavezi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia – Jakarta.
There are videos in social networks that show the moment of a collision.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in Palu when the wave of tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist assassination in New York City.
New York Federal Prosecutors want a death penalty for Sifulo Saipov, the suspect of a terrorist attack in New York, in which eight people died -- a rare punishment that has not been committed in the State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30-year-old, claimed to have used a truck renting Home Depot to assassinate the veloaley in October near the West Side Highway in Manhattan, gasing walkers and bicycles on his way.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "inventedly" killed eight victims and "intentionally" has caused severe physical damage, according to the notification of the intention of a request for a death penalty filed in the Southern District, New York.
According to the judicial paper, both charges could end with a death sentence.
A week after the assassination, an expansion federal conviction sent to Saipov's 22-point prosecution, including eight reket-related charges used by federal prosecutors in cases of organised crime, as well as the charges of violence and destruction of the IPS.
The attack required "serious planning and deliberate intentions", prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as "a terrible, cruel and perverse".
"Syfulo Habibulayevich has caused traumas, damages and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Ernan Feluci and Alejandro Damien Panuko," the notification said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last Southern District of New York seeks death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but subsequently sentenced to life in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was committed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 – Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after a conspiracy sentence and spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an uzbekistan by folk, has not shown a sense of repentance during the days and months after the assassination, according to the court's papers.
He told the investigators that he felt well from what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching IDIL videos on his phone, the prosecution said.
He also asked in his hospital room to place the IDIL flag, the police said.
He pleads innocent by the prosecution that consists of 22 points.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, noted that they were "očevidly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We say the decision to seek a death sentence instead of accepting a sentence as guilty and imprisoned for life without the possibility of early release will only extend the traumatic effect of these events to all affected," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had asked the prosecution not to want a death sentence.
Member of the conservative parliament says NYJOL FARAŽ must lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Faraz pledged to "mobilize the army of the people" today, during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former British Independence Party leader said politicians should "fetch the pressure" -- as one of the members of Teresa May's own party suggested that he leads negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonn, a conservative deputy, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "will have come out so far", if Mr Faraz was the Secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced to deal with the deeply divided rows of the party was highlighted by conservatives supporting the remainder that joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain its compromise plan "Chequers", despite attacks from supporters of Brexit, the EU supporters.
The allies insist that it will make progress in its attempt to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions and insist Euroskeptics and leyberists to choose between its package and "haos".
Mr. Bonn told protesters with a slogan "Exit means going out" in Solichle that he wanted to "forsake Chequers".
He pointed out that Mr Faraz had to participate, of course, with the others and that he had to receive the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we'd have left so far," he said.
Wellingborough deputy added: “I support Brexit, but we have to drop the Chequers plan.
By declaring his opposition attitude to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be ill.
We want to create our laws in our own country."
Mr Bonn rejected the claims that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain is completely false. ”
Conservative representative Andrea Jenkins also participated in the rally, saying to reporters: “I am simply saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
"Chequers" is not popular among the wide public, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not popular in our party and our activists who actually went out on the street and really helped us be elected.
Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs. May, she added: “The prime ministers keep their position when they keep their promises. ”
Mr Faraž told the rally that politicians should "have a sense of pressure" if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
"It is now about trust between us -- people -- and our political class," he said.
"They are trying to change Brexit and we are gathered here today to say, "We won't let you get away with this."
In addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the edge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
"We mobilize the army of the nation of this country that helped us win the Brexit, and we will never stop until we become independent, self-governmenting, proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, supporters went on a march through Birmingham before they had a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
Shepa activists raised flags with the signs "Conservatives against Brexit", after the group launched this weekend.
The Laberist Lord Adonis was ridiculed with the conservators on the security issues of the party's application when he opened the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can dispose of IT systems and all Canada's technology and more, and yet, for the unprecedented crossing of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"This is a full farce.
There is no such thing as good Brexit," he added.
Warren says he'll "consider seriously" his bid for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren announced that it would "develop seriously the opportunity to run for president" after November's elections.
Boston Globe announced that the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during the city council in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against the state representative of the Republicans Jeff Deal, who was jointly chaired by Trump's campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It is in the centre of speculation that it can take Trump's post in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holliouk was her 36th meeting with voters in the mayor's building after Trump's entry into office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for "women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top".
Arrested for the death of Simms from LSU
Baton Rouge Police, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that there was a suspect in the shooting on Friday when a basketball player Wade Simms was killed from LSU.
Baton Rouge's police department reported Daiton Simpson's arrest, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 A.M. East Time.
They posted a video of the shooting Friday and asked for help identifying the man who was seen on the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms has been shot in the head, which ultimately leads to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 Sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene, had a gun, and he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without a problem and arrested in the arrest of the municipality of East Baton Rouge.
A young man with growth of 6′6′′′′, grew up in Baton Rouge – Simms participated in 32 matches with 10 dates as a titler last season and recorded average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 matches.
Grand Pri of Russia: Louis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title after the directions of the team helped him defeat Sebastian Fetel
Since the moment Walteri Botas ranked ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
Botas made a good start from the first position and seriously annoyed Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Fetel to attack his teammate.
Fetel first made pit-stop and let Hamilton deal with traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be decisive for the exit from the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit-stop on the next round and went after Fetel, but Hamilton managed to beat him after a bold maneuver and driving "gum to tire", which forced Ferrari's pilot with an unwillingness to release the internal part of the runway to avoid punishment with added time after he had already closed his opponent's path with a dangerous double protective maneuver on the third turn.
On top of his 21st birthday, Max Verstopen started from the back row of the start bar and was seven after the end of the first round.
Then he even led through a very long time of the race, since he decided to change his tires later than the others, which would allow him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly beat Kimi Riconen in battle for the fourth position.
Finally he entered for pit-stop in the 44th tour, but he failed to compensate enough in the next eight tours and finally Riconen ended fourth.
It was a hard day, because Walterie did a great job all weekend and turned out to be a real gentleman when you let me get ahead of him.
The team has done an excellent job to win the first two seats on the podium," Hamilton said.
That was really a bad language of the body.
President Donald Trump was ridiculed with Senator Diane Fainstein on the rally on Saturday because of her claim that she had not spread a letter from Christine Blazey Ford, which accuses the Supreme Court's claimor Brett Cavanaugh as a sexual actor.
During the talk of rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention the statements given by Ford to the Senate's legal committee, but instead commented on how what happened in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and dishonest”.
"What can happen and the good that happens in the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see angry people and evil, and disgusting, and dishonest," he said.
"When you look at editions and distribution, they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Fainstein, did you spread out?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document -- "Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I haven't spread."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we spread... no, we haven't spread," he added, imitating the senator.
Fainstein sent a letter with details about Ford's claims against Cavanaugh in July, and it was spread earlier in September – but Fainstein denied that this spread had happened from her office.
"I haven't covered Ford's claims, I haven't spread her history," The Hill reported to the Commission.
"She asked me to maintain confidentiality and I kept confidentiality as she wanted."
But her denial was not well accepted by the president, who commented on the rally on Saturday night: “I will tell you that it was a very bad language of the body.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court's claimor accused of sexual crimes against three women, the president noted that Democrats used claims for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return their power with all possible means.
Look at the disgrace, shame, they do not care who they will hurt, who they have to run over to regain their power and control," the president said by Mediaite.
Elith League: Dundi Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss at the Ellieth League against Belfast Giants, winning a rematch in Dundee by 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants took early in a two-naked match after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowillier hits.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney were flattered for the hosts before Dwyer restored the front of the Giants.
Francois Bushar flattened for Dundee, before both naked of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen strengthened their victory.
This is the third victory at Ellit League for Adam Keef's boys who escaped from the bottom to defeat Dundi in Belfast on 2-1 Friday night.
This was the fourth collision between the opponents this season, when Giants won the previous three matches.
The hit that Dwyer found the result came at the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assistant, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance by assisting Bovilier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart to help balance with the help of Couney at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that Giants took the lead before their first break, marking the second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar re-equalified the chances with a powerful blow in the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran united their efforts to help Neilsen give the lead to Dundee for the first time this match at the end of the second half, and he gave his best of it and consolidated the victory of the team with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
Giants, who lost the last four matches of a total of five meetings, welcome as hosts of Milton Keens for their next Friday match.
The Flight Manager died to make sure hundreds of airplanes on board could escape from an earthquake.
The head of flights in Indonesia was praised as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to fly safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are unfamiliar in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulavezi on Friday by triggering a wave of tsunami.
The strong secondary earthquakes continued to destroy the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a tremendous control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway at that time, would be able to fly safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he decided he was crashing.
He died at the hospital later.
Air Control spokesman, Indonesia, Johannes Sirite, said this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts were broken when we heard about it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach thousands after the country's disasters agency announced that access to the Dongala, Sigi and Buttong cities is limited.
"We assume that the number of deaths will rise because many bodies are still under the debris and many people cannot be reached," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho's spokesperson said.
The waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral took place on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, 35-year-old mother, shared to Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings more bodies.
There's a lack of clean water.
There are maroderships everywhere in the minimages."
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Movement of the Red Cross in Indonesia, stated in CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy now, but it can get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widododo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “Please work day and night to complete all evacuation assignments.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year Indonesia was devastated by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini reported that one person was unknown after a plane crash in a lagoon
The plane that carried out an airplane that crashed into a Lagoon in the Pacific Ocean now reports that a person has been declared missing after earlier stated that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated by the suburban plane.
In a press release Air Niugini said that since Saturday afternoon they could not contact a male-pole Passenger.
The airline added that they work together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in their attempts to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requests for more details about the Passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
The boats of local people helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water while trying to land the airport on the island of Chook.
On Friday, authorities said seven people were admitted to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers left Saturday at the hospital, with everyone in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster remains unclear and the exact sequence of events.
Both the airlines and the US military forces said that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought that the plane passed the runway.
The American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, says the plane went very low.
"This is extremely nice," Janes says.
Janes says that he and the others managed to run through the deep to the cross of water to get to the emergency exits of the flooding plane.
He said the stewardess panicked and screamed, and he suffered a light head trauma.
US Marine Forces say that sailors repairing harbour nearby also helped in the rescue action using a high boat to drive people to the coast before the plane sank into the deepest about 30 meters of water (100 feet).
Data from the Safety Aviation Network suggest that over the last two decades 111 people have died on airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any case.
Analyst exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended with its exhibition this Saturday in the re-process against a man who was accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlet of the US Justice Ministry has witnessed hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Queenton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlet said he received information on the location of several mobile phones showing that Telissa was with Chambers the night of her death, back to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the cops went to question Sandford.
Sanford faced the court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another disagreement is that Tellis said she knew Chambers two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records indicate that they've known each other for only a week.
Roulet pointed out that shortly after Chambers Tellis died, he deleted text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He has wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is planned to begin with its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.

Another black man?!
New York Daughter judges a couple after dismissal for a racist message
The New York babysitter judges a couple for firing for discrimination after receiving a misplaced message from the mother, who complains that she is “the next black person. ”
The couple denys racistness by conveying the desire of “extortion. ”
Lyncy Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was shy when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEE, THE LIKE CHERNOCOGY”, wrote in the text message by Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable, she fired Mrs. Morris, pointing out that the previous nanny, who was afro-American, did not do her job well and that she was expecting a Filipine, New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a reward for a working day then sent home with a taxi.
Now Morris is suing the par for compensation for the dismissal, asking the amount of $ 350 a day for the six-month contract she was initially hired, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you shouldn't do this," she said to Post on Friday, adding "You are sure that this is discrimination."
In response to the request, the couple argued that they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris's employment was a reasonable action, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," Joel Plasco's husband told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you offended, even if it was mistaken?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Compliant with the request of “extortion, ” Plasco claims that his wife had only been born two months ago and was in“ a very difficult situation. ”
"You're going to attack someone in this state?
This is not particularly sweet," the investment banker added.
While the court is still in the process of review, the public opinion quickly condemned the couple in social networks by denying them their behavior and their logic.
Paddington publishers feared that the readers would not feel a relationship with a speaker bear, reveals a new letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the audience, relates to the letter: “It is hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it is published.
Now it's very fun, since we're aware of Paddington's huge success."
She said that her father, who worked as an operator for BBC, before inspiring to write the child's book for a little bear toy, would feel optimistic about the potential rejection of the book, adding that he welcomed the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings", after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as “a major member of our family, ” she added that her father was secretly proud of his ultimate success.
"He was a very modest man and was not self- praised," she said.
"But since Paddington felt so real, it's like having a child that has achieved something: you're proud of him, even though it's not really your job.
I think you've somehow taken Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credits to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
"It kept ringing to say that the situation was really bad that he didn't expect him to survive," Mrs Ednan-Laperuz said.
"Then Nad called me to say he's going to die in two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
Medicines provided by doctors to support her heart slowly cease to act and leave her system.
She's gone a while before, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait and realize that all this is happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get a little tight."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who has been grieving about her daughter's loss, is boarding the plane along with other passengers who have no idea of the test he's going through.
"No one understands," she shares.
"I had my head down, and all the time my tears dried.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt this perpetuating feeling of compassion with Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much you loved her."
The grieving women are putting cards to prevent suicides from the bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones for suicide are trying to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting on a bridge in Wells cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 years old when he started suffering from depression and killed himself when he was 18 years old.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old from Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone knew him after the smile.
They always said that his smile lights every room."
However, he gave up his work before he left, and he was in a “really dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who then was 11 years old, found his brother after he took his life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I constantly worry that this will result in any consequences. ”
Mrs. Davis creates the cards, “to know people that they have someone to go to, and who to talk to, even if this is a friend.
Don't keep your silence - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything," she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he neither looked at them nor looked at anything."
She said that this was a terrible trauma to them, but they had to cope with: “This opens a void in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight."
If you are struggling to cope, you can contact the Samaritans on 116 123 (for Britain and Ireland), send an email to jo@samaritans.org or visit the site of the Samaritans here.
Brett Cavanaugh's future is under question after the FBI is initiating an investigation.
I imagined whether we could really achieve what he wanted -- an investigation with a limited length and a limited range -- maybe we could unite our efforts," Mr. Fleke said on Saturday and added that he fears that the commission is falling apart despite the confirmed overparty blocking.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is because of the moment itself.
Early elections are only five weeks later, on November 6th -- if Republicans are not present well, their attempts to be elected at the highest court in the state will be seriously injured.
George W. Bush calls the senators by inviting them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares his report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where members are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pens to declare equality and confirm his bid for the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean fugitives "small" with Kim
South Korean lawmakers claim that the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Chen Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Beeong Sug, quoted as saying from the South Korean United Nations Ministry, said 1127 fugitives last year, compared to 2011, were 2706.
According to Mr. Park, the stricter border control between North Korea and China, as well as the higher amounts required by human traffickers is the key factors.
There's no official comment from Phenyan.
Most of the North fugitives eventually receive citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul states that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, where the longest border is located with North Korea and is passed easier than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone (DMC), which divides the two Koreans.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not as refugees, as he often repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the heads of the two countries met in Phenyan for talks focused on the stall in nuclear disarming talks.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Un in Singapore, where they agreed to work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho accused US sanctions of lack of progress ever since.
"With lack of confidence in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves first unilaterally," Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he's not suitable for serving in the Supreme Court
The minority leader at the Nance Pelosi Congress called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Cavanaugh "true" and said he is too unbalanced to serve in the Supreme Court .
Pelosi commented this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"There was no way to think that if a woman had reacted that way, they would call it "hysterical," Pelosi said on his reaction to Cavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's legal committee on Thursday.
Kavano emotionally rejected allegations that he committed sexual impression on Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavano was very emotional, in times he almost shouted and discouraged when he was discussing his family and his student age.
He also firmly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the claims against him "grotesque and coordinated attack against the person", organised by liberals who are unhappy that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi pointed out that Kavano's witness statements demonstrated that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court, as it became clear that he was predisposed to the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with these claims and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi denied when they asked whether he would try to discredit Cavanaugh if he was appointed and in case the Democrats received a majority at the House of Representatives.
"I will say it like that -- if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only involuntary to enter the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavano is now a judge at the Washington Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that, in its capacity as a Democrat, she is concerned about the potential arrangements of Cavanaugh in relation to the Act of Accession of Health or the Row v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Cavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
"Now it is not the time for a hysterical, persuasive person to enter the court and expect us to say, "Isn't it great," Pelosi finished.
Women must be mastered, too.
This is a fundamental criticism, after months and years of splashing anger, and she can't accept it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs Steinum told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, “I received a huge help from a woman who was an executive director somewhere who said that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and wept, she said to her neighbor, “You might think I was sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just keeps going.
I thought this was genius."
The tears are allowed in the expression of anger, partly because they misunderstand from the beginning.
One of my clearest memories from the previous job, in the office mostly with men, is how once, as I slipped out of incredibly anger, an older woman caught me for a neck - a freezing boss, which I always had a little fear - and she dragged me to the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they did it to you."
Patricia Schroeder, at the time a democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extracurricular relationship on a yacht called Monkey Business, and retired from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision," she told me 30 years later, laughing.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was another one to appear.
Someone called the situation the Snow and the Seven dwarfs.
Since it is involved late in the campaign, it is behind the funding collection and decides that it will not remain in the race if it fails to raise 2 million US dollars.
The battle is previously condemned to failure.
She understands that some of her supporters who give a thousand dollars to men would only give her 250 bucks.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During his speech, which suggests that it will not continue with a formal campaign, it is so much of anxiety - thanks to the people who supported it, displeasure against the system that makes it so hard to raise money and that you can turn to the voters, not delegates, as well as anger against sexism that she felt.
"A man may think I had a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalls how the media reacted.
“Someone may think Kleenex are my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone?

How can the trade war between the United States and China serve Beijing
The first shootings in the US-China trade war were depreciating and, as the battle has yet to raise speed, one scatter between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the President of the United States, launched the first warp this year, charging taxes key elements from China's exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tension appeared this week with new duties that affect the production of 200 billion US dollars (150 billion British pounds) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported to the United States from China.
Every time Beijing repayed with five to ten percent of US goods for $60 billion.
China has pledged to retaliate every strike of the United States and soon the second largest world economy is expected to ignore this.
To make Washington quit means to submit to the demands, but to put a head in public in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for C. Jinpin, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays his cards correctly, the pressure from the US trade war can help China's long-term plan to reduce the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a premature political decision both in Washington and in Beijing can create conditions for an economic crisis in either of the countries is actually more dangerous than observers acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a scientific co-operative on issues related to Asia to the Scientific Group of the New American Security Centre.
Syria "read" to return refugees, Foreign Minister said
Syria announced that it was ready to return refugees voluntarily and asks for assistance in the recovery of the country devastated by the war that lasted more than seven years.
In addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem stressed that the state's conditions are improving.
"Today the situation in place is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress we have in fighting terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore areas devastated by terrorists to return them to their normal condition.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the state that were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily and food.
The UN estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have left the state since the beginning of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem said the Syrian regime would welcome any assistance in the recovery of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that no conditional support or aid will be accepted by countries financed by the rebels.
Europe Wins Ryder Cost in Paris
Europe's team won the Ryder expensive for 2018, overriding the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10,5 Le Golf National in the vicinity of Paris, France.
Thus, the United States has six consecutive losses on European land and has not won Raider Cost in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned its championship crown to the tournament after the team led by Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the necessary 14,5 points that guaranteed victory over the United States.
The Star of the United States, Phil Michelson, who presented himself weakly during the majority of the tournament, sent his first blow to the 16th hole (with "par" 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari presented himself greatly in all rounds, becoming one of the four players in the history of the tournament reached balance 5-0-0 since the race took place in the current form since 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost with 5 & 4 out of the player in the team of Europe in the lowest position in the rankings – Torborn Olesen from Denmark.
The leader in the world ranglist, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of Ian Poulter from England, for whom this is probably the last part of the Raider expensive.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight shares in Raider Skup, became the European with the most won points in the tournament for all time, and this year increased its asset to 25,5 points.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't abstain.
It was a tough year.
I am extremely grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can lift the bowl again.
In everything the most important is the team and I am happy to be able to help," said the excited Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He transmits the staff to his countryman John Ram, who defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods with 2 & 1 singles on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud that I defeated Tiger Woods, yet I grew up while watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four matches in France and its overall balance of Ryder expensive is already 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players for all time, won 14 major titles – a indicator only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulties all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf all the days of the tournament.
The captain of the U.S. team Jim Furik said after the disappointing presentation of the team: “I am proud of these boys, they fought.
At one time this morning, we pressed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players were very well introduced.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the US Professional Golf Association and our Raider Sculpture Committee and look forward only ahead.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take off your opponent's hat.
We just got high."
