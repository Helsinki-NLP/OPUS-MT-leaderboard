In this phase of world history, in America there is no such thing as an independent press. You know it and I know it. Among you there is no one who dares to write his sincere opinion, and if he wrote it, he would know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I was getting my regular salary to keep my sincere opinion outside the newspapers I work for. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he thinks, would find himself out, on the street, looking for some other business. That I let my opinion appear only in one issue of newspapers that I do, I would get fired from work for less than 24 hours....
