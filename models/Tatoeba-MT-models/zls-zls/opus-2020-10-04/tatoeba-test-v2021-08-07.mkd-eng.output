I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I like your website very much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really like to learn French.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember how I met the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I cried one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'll bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there something missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flight facility.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him playing cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister tear the letter off.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Buddhism is religion or philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes calorie?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," the blind man said.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats apple or banana?
I took my head right away.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should be sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I need to pack.
I have to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should've known you'd be here.
I should have refused.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Tateba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I glued his slap.
I'm sleeping on my feet.
I sleep standing.
I slept like a slaughter.
I slept in the bow.
I slept on a bus.
I cut off the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic drinks?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy you the house?
Isn't this too good?
I kind of like it.
It's been my whole day cleaning snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I hit something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks it happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is the delivery paid?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a prize?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is it Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this real diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow, I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Does Tom die of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Does Tom bother you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I burned the matches in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly, I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on the demand for a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
You're too hungry to get down.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you or burn and if you were the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I use the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what objects to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
Couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no, no, no.
It's not possible!
It's about you.
It seemed a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It would be good.
You didn't bother me.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It won't get any better.
Doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; either way you have to.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like anyone knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
It's just there.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do with.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It happens.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think she's right.
I think she's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I better help him.
I think I better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'll go see Tom and see how he is.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good point.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French quite well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it'd be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's heartless.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a serpent.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's got a lot on his mind.
I think Tom's vain.
I think Tom's intelligent.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going.
I think we can get him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're panicking.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should pick her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
I thought I'd ask for help.
I thought I lost all the money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was coming to me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom went well.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you'll have a job to do.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Well, don't you hate him?
He seemed tired to me.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you were only dating girls lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were better off playing chess than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning to stay in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts so bad here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the cup cap up.
It's a multiphase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
I can't answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I'm gonna do the job in one day.
Today's less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Do you mind if I use that?
I'm paying.
He doesn't come considerably.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
It's hotter today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It kind of seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about that.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's almost Christmas.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
He looked terrible.
He looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks delicious.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
I guess I drank too much yesterday.
Looks like these two are having a relationship again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He healed me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
It might rain tonight.
It might seem weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It's possible it's raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them and told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it would be hard to do.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get nasty.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I've taken care of it.
I've got a room.
I came back with a bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
I got my pants off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It's probably not worth waiting.
It was raining two days ago.
You've had a lot of difficulty.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't get it.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I truly regret that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you drink the medicine they prescribed you.
It's a child's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
We're all done here.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost gonna have to leave.
It's really fun.
It's 7:00.
It's already 11:00.
It's already open.
It's an irrelevant mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risk plan.
Too bad concrete doesn't burn.
We're walking fast.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They unlocked it.
You just made me sick.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
You better be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceiving than being pessimistic and right.
“ It’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. ”
It's empty.
Sauna's here.
It's a new money.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's time to close.
Cold in here.
You know you don't like Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to appreciate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's upsetting.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in jail than then run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily tell them.
I guess I misjudged it.
Looks like her style.
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to curse.
It's ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's dressing.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It'll be beastly.
It's gonna get colder.
It'll happen soon enough.
It's good to see you all again.
It's a good training.
It's good.
It's getting better.
It's so fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take us long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just imaginary.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of skin.
It's my decision, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.
It's nice to feel that someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's loud in here.
It's none of your business!
It's not a secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That doesn't have a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It won't be easy to do it without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just speculation.
It's not an ordinary pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
That's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not a spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a print error.
It's obvious for everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
It sounds like Tom.
That sounds very strong.
Sounds very good.
It's our job to help them.
It's totally white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's bumped.
It's actually very common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom doesn't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It really sucks.
It's a shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
It's not good yet.
He's still growing.
He's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in their own place.
It's very strong.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
It doesn't support this heat.
It's unique and indispensable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom immediately.
She's relaxing very much.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I'm guessing.
There's a wind.
It's work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
The water only takes three minutes to burn.
It's been going on all night.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're an unexpectedly pronounced word.
I turned the fan on and pointed it towards the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great privilege for me to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was midnight.
This was an arena day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was okay here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible view.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure I spent the night with a smart, ghost and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a hot night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
Such behavior was childish by his side.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
It was fun yesterday.
It was night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that the bulls living on dogs jump higher than those living on cats.
It was so magnificent.
It was pretty funny.
It was really cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He's been blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
The day was so beautiful, we decided to hike.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me a picture attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was sad.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unbelievable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
They won't help lies.
That won't help you.
It works well.
It would be very normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk by tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to keep you safe.
I used to dream about becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I use that computer.
I use this.
I already packed.
I already read it.
I have already written everything that was to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone always helped me.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with something else.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
It's been a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been briefed.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was sloppy.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I gave her help.
I gave them help.
They hired me to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I've lived here for years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I've been studying French since I was 13.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it so far.
I came for them.
I came to bring him a present.
I cut my finger.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences this month.
I decided to forgive him.
I decided to forgive them.
I decided to take the train.
I decided to go.
I decided to let you get back to work.
I decided to stay where I am.
I've fallen in love with you.
I finally found you.

You did your job well.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about it, right?
You already did.
You did your best.
You don't have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
They're good, right?
Do you have a key by chance?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know, my dick.
You don't know anything.
Dream you know.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't need to dress anything.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't understand business.
You don't want to do anything that reminds them you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You're entitled to one phone call.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
You've got one shot.
You're wrong, people.
You were right, guys.
Your hair is broken.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got great work to do.
You're being bitten by a conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit I don't like.
You have tiny breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have merciful eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I honor you.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
You've never seen one, have you?
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a gift.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay away from him.
You can't lose your condition.
You have to try, Tom.
You have very nice lips.
You've got a lot of penetrated eyes.
You just heard.
He just came back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You don't get involved in this.
Kids, stay here.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I would do anything for your beautiful eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're learning fast.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
You left me in desperation.
You let Tom get away.
You want your life, don't you?
You'll be all right.
You're gonna get confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be informed in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll be better.
You'll get it back.
They're gonna make you a mustache.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
You're going with me and a point!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're gonna have to learn harder next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.
They'll never see you in that club.
You'll never guess.
You'll never know.
You'll understand when it's time.
You looked beautiful.
You look familiar to me.
You look beautiful.
You look pretty bad.
You look so good.
What's wrong?
You look imaginary.
You look very handsome, Tom.
You've earned something.
You gave your word.
You're upsetting me.
Maybe you'll be needed.
You can go anywhere.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
You can sleep here.
It wouldn't be bad if you slowed down.
You met my sister, right?
Maybe you can help them.
You have to be careful.
You must be confused.
You must have made it very easy.
You must have jumped.
You must be so proud.

You need to grow up and grow up a little bit.
You need to help her.
I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You didn't ask why.
He didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You're paying me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It went red.
He was running as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints upset me.
Your offences dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.
Your desserts are tempting, but we're fine.
You're ready to cry.
You're absolutely right.
You're a real hater.
You're acting weird.
You're a mess.
You're a fraud.
You're after them.
You're a good son.
You're a kind man.
You're all scary.
You're all the same.
You're really good.
But you cheated on her.

Something's weakened me.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're lucky.
You're lying to me.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
You're gorgeous.
You're upsetting Tom.
You're my neighbor.
You're not my friend.
You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.
You won't find them.
You won't find us.
You're under her level.
You're under his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.
You're not too old for her.
You can go now.
You're crazy!
But you're smart.
You're our guests.
You're out of alcohol.
You have too much work to do.

You're lying, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
Why don't you go see a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.
That's a good memory.
Your moon's coming back.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
Your path is difficult.
Your doctorate must be written in English.

Your propaganda is not interesting.
Your faith is nasty.
Your role here is so important.
Your shelf is full of books.
There's yours.
Your sister's asleep.
Your sons are pretty hot.
All your things are here.
Your wishes are my command.
Your patent's unbuttoned.
That's what you said an hour ago.
You told me to call you anytime.
You said we'd never catch her.
You said you'd help.
You said you were gonna text me in the evening, but you lied to me, obviously.
You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to already know the answer.
You look like you're getting cold.
You seem to have an infection.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
Do you share his interest in this book?
You need to ask for help.

You cut your ankle.
You're so beautiful.
You really talk a lot.
You talk too much about Boston.
You only think it's weird because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are very sweet together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're backwards.
You've been drunk.
You've been in a car accident, but you're gonna be fine.
We missed you.
It was very helpful to us.
You're right from the beginning.
You made white again!
You bought something to Mary.
You beat me.
You beat them.
You've done so much.
You scared her.
You're overreacting!
You have a rash.
You're troubled enough.
You misunderstood me.
I promise you.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You blew it, Tom.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been postponing this for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were unbelievable.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky you survived the attack.
You're wrong.
It's not like you were wrong.
You were right, Tom.
He drove fast.
You were great.
You're not sleeping all night, are you?
He was very brave.
You were wrong about the picture.
You will do as I command.
You'll find your toys and books.
You're not gonna need that.
You won't make it.
You won't win.
You're too worried about him.
You wouldn't want to be late.
Yeah, I'm mad.
