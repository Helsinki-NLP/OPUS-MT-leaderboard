People used chairs to hit glasses, but the windows didn't break.
The survivor Francis Koval said one of the glasses finally broke and they started coming out of the window."
Because of the energy obtained in the uniting of hydrogen atoms (or their merging) to form more heavy elements, the stars emit light and heat.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in a similar way.
However, this is a very difficult task to solve and it will take many years before we see the construction of useful synthetic reactors.
The steel needle is kept on the surface of the water due to the surface voltage.
The cause of the surface voltage is that the water molecules on the surface of the water are highly attracted to each other more than to the air molecules above them.
Water molecules create invisible skin on its surface, allowing things like the needle to sail from above.
The blade of the modern skate has a double edge with a dent in the middle of it, and the two edges provide a better grip on the ice, even on the knee.
The edge, which is in contact with the ice, is also curved as the bottom of the blade is slightly curved until it leans to one side or the other.
This allows the skater to roll. If the skates lean to the left, the scanner turns left, if the skater leans to the right, the scanner turns to the right.
They need to get rid of the additional energy they get from the light to return to their previous energy level.
They do this by emitting small particles of light called “photones. ”
This process is called by scientists “stimulated radiation radiation emitting” because atoms are stimulated by bright light, causing the emitting of photons, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next picture shows emitting photons atoms, actually, of course, the photos are much smaller than those in the picture.
The photos are even smaller than the material that builds the atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, the spiral in the light bulb burns and it doesn't work anymore.
The bulb must be changed afterwards, and you should be careful when switching the electric light bulb.
First, the switch for the lighting body or the cable must be disconnected.
This is because the electricity that flows in the contact where the metal part of the light bulb is located can cause a strong electric impact. This can happen if you touch the inside part of the contact or the metal base of the light bulb, while it is still partially in contact.
The main organ of the blood system is the heart that has the function of the blood pump.
The blood is distant from the heart of the tubes called arteries, and returns back to the heart of the pipes called "waves". The smallest pipes are called "capillars".
Triceratops could chew with their teeth not only leaves but also very hard branches and roots.
According to some scientists, triceratopses have ate cicados that are a species of plant often seen during the crede period.
These plants are like miniature palm trees with a crown of sharp, barbed leaves.
Triceratops may have used his healthy shell to stain the leaves before eating the stem.
There are also scientists who argue that these plants are very poisonous and it is unlikely that any dinosaur has eaten them, although in these days lazy animals and other animals such as papagai (the descendant of dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you step on his surface, you'll weigh less than when you're on Earth.
A man weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will be about 36 pounds of Yo. Gravity, of course, will act weaker.
Unlike the Earth, the sun has no bark on which you can step, all built by gases, fire and plasma.
The gas flows away from the center of the sun.
The outer part of the sun that we see when we look at it is called “fotosphere ” or“ ball of light. ”
The Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo used a telescope to observe that Venus had phases, just like the Moon about 3,000 years later, in 1610.
The stages are happening because only the sunsided side of Venus (or the moon) is lighting up. Venus phases support Copernik's theory that the planets are circling the sun.
Then, a few years later, in 1639, English astronomer Jeremiah Horox watched Venus’ transit.
England is experiencing a long peaceful period after Denlo's reoccupation.
However, in 991 Ethelred faced a Viking Navy greater than anyone since the day of Gutrum century earlier.

In the beginning, he named the Hangeum alphabet Hangeul, which means "the right sounds for instructing people".
There are many theories of how the Sanskrit appeared, one of which is for migrates from the West of Arians who brought their tongue with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the talks in Europe Latin.
The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit, after the compilation of the Sancristians, it just faded because of the hierarchy.
As Latin is a source of European languages such as French and Spanish, Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that served as a source of many contemporary Indian languages.
With the completion of the battle for France, Germany begins to prepare to invade the British island.
The code name of the attack of Germany is "Operation Silayan". Most of the heavy weapons and ammunition of the British army were lost during its evacuation from Dünkerk, so the army was pretty weak.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and could destroy any invasion ships sent through Lamansha.
However, very few ships of the Royal Navy were located near the likely invasion routes, as the Admirals feared that they would be sunk by the German air attacks.
Let's start with the explanation of the plans of Italy. Italy was mainly the "little brother" of Japan and Germany.
There was a weaker army and a weaker fleet, even though they built four new ships just before the war began.
The main goals of Italy were the African countries. In order to conquer these countries, they had to possess a platform so that the troops could cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
That is why they needed to get rid of the British bases and ships in Egypt. In addition to these actions, Italian warships had nothing else to do.
Like Britain, Japan was an island country.
The submarines are ships designed to travel underwater and stay there for a long time.
The submarines were used during the First and Second World War, then they were very slow and had a very limited range of gunshots.
At the beginning of the war, they primarily traveled on the surface of the sea, but when the radar began to develop and become more accurate to avoid being noticed, the submarines were forced to float underwater.
The German submarines were called “subwater boats. ” The Germans were very good in navigation and management of their submarines.
Because of the success of the Germans with the submarines, after the war, they can't be trusted to possess many of them.
King Tutankamon, sometimes called King Tutt or the Boy King, is one of the most famous ancient Egyptian Pharaohs in these days."

We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Omir - the legendary blind poet who created two remnants of Greek literature: the poems "Illiada" and "Odisey", is probably the most famous representative of this culture.
Soffolk and Aristophane are still popular dramaturgs and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is the mathematician Pitagor, known mostly by his famous theorem of relationships between the sides of rectangle triangles.
There are various assessments about how many people speak Hindi. It is believed to be between the second and fourth most used language in the world.
The number of local speakers varies depending on whether very closely connected dialects are numbered or not.
Approximate estimates vary from 340 million to 500 million speakers and up to 800 million people can understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu are similar to the vocabulary composition, but they are differently written; speakers in both languages are usually able to understand each other in daily conversations.
In the 15th century, Northern Estonia was under the strong cultural influence of Germany.
In their desire to bring God closer to local people, some German monks invented the Estonian literal language.
It is based on the German alphabet, which is added to a letter ‘.’.
In time, many words borrowed from German have merged. It was the beginning of enlightenment.
More traditionally, the successor of the throne entered the army directly after he graduated school.
Charles, however, recorded the University of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and later history and received 2:2 (lower degree second grade).
The first member of the British royal family, who was honored to graduate, was Charles.
Three percent of the country are covered by European Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Romania on the Balkan Peninsula).

Learning to create interactive media requires common and traditional skills, as well as tools learned in interactive classes (storyboard, audio and video editorial, story story story, etc.)
The interactive design requires that you reevaluate your perceptions of media production and learn to think innocately.
The interactive design requires the components of one project to connect with each other, but also to make sense as a separate unit.
The focal complexity and the number of elements of the lens needed to achieve a range of focused lengths is much greater than in normal lenses, and this is the shortage of elevated lenses.
This problem is getting smaller because lense manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of lenses.
This allowed the targets to increase to produce quality images compared to the lenses achieved with a fixed length of focus.
Another lack of elevated lenses is that usually the maximum aperture (speed) of the lens is lower.
This makes cheap lenses to scale hard to use without lightning at low levels.
Among the most common problems in attempts to convert a film into a DVD format is superscaning.
Most TVs are made to satisfy the wide audience.
So all you see on TV is cut off edges from above, from the bottom and from the side.
This is done to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. It's called an image that exceeds the frame of the screen.
When you make a DVD, its ends, unfortunately, will most likely be cut off and if the video has subtitles too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired imagination, shouting images of tournaments, festivities and the knight's spirit of King Arthur.
Even though they stand among the millennium ruins, it is not hard to hear the sounds and smell the smells of long past battles, you almost hear the gigs on the poles and smell the fear that rises from the underground pits.
But is our imagination based on reality, why are the castles built, how are they designed and built?
Corby Maxlow’s castle is typical for this period, and it looks more like a fortified house than a real castle.
The big glass windows and the thin walls wouldn't last long for a decisive attack.
In 1480, when Lord Hastings was building it, the country was relatively calm and needed protection only against small groups of wandering maroders.
The balance of power was a system in which European countries strive to maintain the national sovereignty of all European countries.
The concept is that all European nations must strive to prevent a nation from becoming strong and national governments often change their unions to maintain the balance.
The first war, whose main issue was the balance of power, was the war for the Spanish heritage.
This marks an important change because European forces no longer have the preexistence of religious wars. Thus, the Thirty Years of War will be the last war called “religious”.
At the fire performed by Herostrat on 21 July 356 B.C.E., the temple of Artemida in Ephesus was destroyed.
According to history, his motivation was at all costs to achieve glory. The angered ephesians declared that Herostrat's name would never be entered.
The Greek historian Strabo later marks the name, and so we know today, the temple was destroyed the same night Alexander Great was born.
In his capacity as king, Alexander suggested to take over the costs of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander died, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.

Civilization was flourished in the region of the Ind River, where its name came from.
Although some scientists speculate that since civilization existed also in the pools of the already dried river Sarasvati, it should be called civilization Ind-Sarasvati, while some call it Harap civilization on the name of Harapa, the first of its objects that was dug up in 1920.
The development of medicine is helped by the military nature of the Roman Empire.
Emperor August begins to call doctors and even form the first Roman medical corps to be used after the battles.
Surgeons knew different sedatives, including morphine extracts of mac seeds and scopolamin of herbal seeds.
They receive great experience in amputations to save patients from gangrene, as well as the use of tournaments and arteries to stop the blood flow.
For many centuries, the Roman Empire has made great progress in the field of medicine and has formed a large part of our known knowledge today.
Puerland origami is an origami with the limit that only one clamp can be made at a certain time, more complex clamps such as reverse clamps are not allowed, and all stiffs have simple locations.

Children develop understanding about race and race stereotypes and these stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves with a race minority, which is stereotyped by not doing well at school after learning about a stereotype associated with their race, usually do not do well at school.
MySpace currently has 54 million user profiles and is the third popularity website used in the United States.
These websites attracted much attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites have positive aspects that include an opportunity to easily create a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos and other features.
You can get easy access to this page by providing only one web address that facilitates memory and writing for students who would have problems using the keyboard or spell.
It can be personalized so that it can be read easily and also with very or very little color, according to your desire.
The shortage syndrome of attention is a neurologic syndrome whose classically defining triad of symptoms includes impulsiveness, tendency to distractions and hyperactivity or excess energy.
This is not a difficulty in training, but an educational disorder; it “inflicts 3 to 5 percent of all children, perhaps up to 2 million American children. ”
Children with a syndrome of attention (ADD) are difficult to focus on school work, but can concentrate on things that they like to do, play games or write sentences without punctuation, or watch their favorite animations.
These children tend to get into a lot of trouble because they “have a risky behavior, go into battles and seek the achievement of authority ” to stimulate their brains because their brains cannot be stimulated by normal methods.
The shortage syndrome affects the relationship with other peers, because other children cannot understand why they act like that, or why they spell in this way, or that their level of maturity is different.
Since the ability to gain knowledge and to learn has changed in the above way, the base speed that acquires knowledge has also changed.
The feedback to obtain information was different. There is no pressure within individual cancellation, now the focus is on the possibility of cancelling the text.
In general, during Renaissance, the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge is significantly changing.
Unlike other primates, hominides already use their hands to carry weights, swing on trees and move.
The hand and step of the chimpanzee are similar to the size and length, reflecting the use of the hand to carry the weight when walking with a bone.
The human hand has more straightenings and is shorter than the foot.
The fossil bones of the hand of two to three million years of age reveal this change in the specialization of the hand from moving to processing.
Some people believe that frequent experience of very artificially provoked dreams can be very exhaustive.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of clear dreams that increase the time between the state of rapid eye movement (REM).
With less REM per night, this condition in which you actually sleep and your body recovers becomes too rare and becomes a problem.
It's just as tired as if you wake up every 20 or 30 minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often at night your brain tries to dream clearly.
In North Africa, almost from the beginning, things were not going well for the Italians. Within a week after the declaration of a war from Italy on 10 June 1940, the 11th Husar regiment conquered the Fort Capuco in Libya.
The British captured the main engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastuci, in an Eastern Bardia ambush.

The game is played on grass, and the grass by the hole hairs low and is called a green.
Probably the most common kind of tourism is the one that connects to travel by most people: recreational tourism.
When people go to a place that is very different from their normal daily life to relax and entertain, we talk about it.
The beaches, thematic parks and campsites are often the most visited places of tourists for vacation.
If the purpose of visiting a certain place is to know his history and culture, this kind of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can consider various attractions in the country or choose to focus on only one area.
Seeing this activity, the colonists also called for backup.
The armies intensifying the front positions included 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiment of 200 people under the command of Colonel James Reed and John Stark (two later become generals).
On the north end of the Colonist position, Stark's people took positions.
When the drain opened the slope along the Mistic River River's proximity along the northeast part of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall north, which ended up to the edge of the water on a small beach.
Gridley or Stark put a stake at about 100 feet outside the fence and ordered no fire until the civilians crossed.
The American plan envisaged coordinated attacks from three different countries.
General John Kadwalder would have launched a detour attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block possible reinforcements.
General James Ewing will be translating through the river 700 military with the Tranton ferry, we will take the bridge over Asunpink Creek and prevent the enemy forces from escape.

With a change of running from a quarter mile to a half mile, the speed becomes much more important as endurance becomes absolutely necessary.
Of course, a first-class runer at 800 meters, a person who can run the distance in less than two minutes, must have a high speed, but endurance must be trained at any cost.
Several country runs in winter, combined with gymnastic exercises for the upper part of the body, are the best preparation for the run season.

Sportsmen may have the feeling that they prefer a certain product even when he does not bring them real benefit.
The atom can be viewed as one of the main construction parts of the whole matter.
This is a very complex unit that according to the simplified model of Bor consists of central core and walking electronics around it, something like planets around the sun - see Fig 1.1.
The core consists of two types of particles – protons and neutrals.
The protons have a positive electric charge, while the neutrons do not have at all.

The study indicates that depression, fear, and black vision mediate in the relationship between pain and disability in those suffering from pain in the lower back.
Only the consequences of the disaster, not depression and fear depended on regular weekly PA sessions.
Participants in regular activity needed more support for the negative perception of pain, to distinguish chronic pain from the sense of discomfort in normal physical movement.
The vision or visibility depends on the sensitive organs of the visual system or the eyes.
There are many different designs of eyes with different complexity according to the requirements of the body.
Different structures have different properties, sensitive to different wave lengths and have different degrees of sharpness. They also require different processing to make sense of incoming data, as well as different numbers to work optimally.
The collection of organisms of certain species within a geographical area is a population.
When all individuals in a population are identical to a phenotype line, they are defined as monomorphic.
Individuals are polymorphic when they demonstrate several options of a particular line.
Colonys of ant soldiers also march and nest in different stages.
In the Nomad phase, the ants march at night and stop camping during the day.
After the food is reduced, the colony approaches a nomadic phase. In the course of this phase, the colony makes temporary nests that change every day.
Each of these nomadic rebellions or marches lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", which means “small room ” and is originally created by a microscopeist who observes the structure of the cork.
The main unit of all living beings is the cell, and all organisms are composed of one or more cells.
Cells are so vital and important for studying life that they are often defined as “the construction elements of life. ”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis, sending nerve impulses through the body to maintain the flow of blood and its indestructability.
These nerve impulses can be sent so quickly into the whole body that helps him to protect from any potential threats.
The tornados devastate a small area compared to other raging storms, but they can destroy everything on their way.

Many people dream of a day when people can travel to another star and explore other worlds. Some people wonder what's there, others believe that aliens or other lives can live on another planet.
But if this ever happens, it's probably not going to happen for a long time. There are trillions of kilometers between the stars that are "neighbours".
Perhaps one day your grandchildren will stand at the top of an alien world wondering about their ancient ancestors?
The bodies of animals consist of many cells, they eat different things and mimic them in their stomachs. Most animals can move.
Only animals have brains (even if not all; meduses, for example, do not have).
Animals are all over the earth, they dig underground, swim in the oceans and fly into the sky.
One cell is the smallest structure and functional unit of the living body.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella, in translation of a small room.
If you look under the microscope of living beings, you will see that they consist of small squares or balls.
Robert Hook, a biologist from England, saw with a microscope small squares in a cork.
He was the first person to watch dead cells.
Going from one state to another and not changing the elements and compounds.
The nitrogen in gas condition still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid condition is thicker, but the molecules are the same.
Another example is water. The composition of water consists of two atoms of hydrogen and one oxygen atom.
Whether it's gas, liquid or solid substance, it has the same molecular structure.
Although his physical condition can take a change, the chemical is maintained without change.
Time is all around us and affects everything we do, but it's hard to understand.
Time is studied by scientists in the field of religion, philosophy and science for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events flowing from the future to the present and then the past.
Time is also how we compare the length of events.
You can mark the past time yourself by watching recurring events. It is cyclically such an event that happens again and again at regular intervals.
In our time, computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
Complicated animations can be created on computers, and this kind of animation is increasingly used in television and films.
Music is often recorded with complex computers to process and mix sounds.
For a long time in the 19th and 20th century, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the maori that hunted giant birds called Moa.
Then the theory lays out the idea that the Maori have migrated from Polynesia with a large fleet and took the New Zealand from the moriors, creating a agricultural society.
But the new evidence suggests that Moriori were a group of maori from the land that moved from New Zealand to the islands of Chatham, developing their own recognized, peaceful culture.
There was another tribe on the islands of Chatham, the Maori who moved away from New Zealand.
They were called morons, and there were a few clashes, and the moriors were finally destroyed.
People who have been involved for several decades have helped us to appreciate our strong sides and passions while we also judge sincerely the difficulties and even failures.
While listening to people sharing their personal, family and organizational stories, we received a valuable understanding of the past and some of the personalities affected by the good or bad culture of the organization.
Understanding the story at least helps people get the idea of where they fall into the history of the organization. Although it does not suggest understanding of culture.
Individuals and all participants discover deeper values, mission and movement forces of the organization by assessing successes and realizing failures.
In this case, what helped people to be open to new changes and new guidelines for the local church was to remind the previous cases of entrepreneurship behaviour and achievements.
Such examples of success have reduced fears of change, while creating positive affections to change in the future.
Convergence models of thinking are techniques for resolving problems, uniting various ideas or areas to reach a solution.
Speed, logic and accuracy are the focus of this thinking, as well as the discovery of facts, the re-use of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important condition for this way of thinking is that only one answer is correct. It is considered only two answers, namely faithful or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain standard procedures or such in science.
People with that kind of thinking have logical thinking, can easily remember models, solve tasks and work on scientific tests.
In reading other people's thoughts, the most talented species are far away.
This means that we are able to successfully predict the perceptions of other people, their intentions, beliefs, knowledge or desires.
Understanding the intentions of others is crucial among these abilities, allowing us to solve possible insights of physical actions.
If you see someone break a window of a car, for example, you'll probably think he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he lost his car's keys and tried to break his own car, he had to be tried differently.
The MR is based on a physical phenomenon called a nuclear-magnetic resonance opened in 1930 by Felix Block (Stanford University) and Edward Persel (Harward University).
The magnetic field and radio waves drive atoms to emit miniature radio signals in this resonance.
Raymond Damadian, a doctor and researcher, discovered in 1970 the basis for the use of magnetic-resonance images as a medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was issued, which was the first world-wide one ensued in the IMR area.
In 1977 Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first MR scanner “for the whole body” that he called “Neslomim”.
Asynchronous communication encourages you to take time to think and cause a reaction to others.
This allows students to work at their own pace, as well as control the rate of receiving information.
There are also fewer time limits with a possibility of flexible working time. (Bremer, 1998)
By using the Internet and the world network, students have access to information at any time.
At any time during the day, students can also ask instructors questions and expect relatively quick answers rather than wait until the next meeting live.
The postmodern approach to learning offers freedom from absolutes.
In fact, there is not one good thing to learn. Learning works through the experience between the student and the presented knowledge.
Our current experience with all training television broadcasts such as “do yourself ” and present information, illustrates this.
Most of us are watching a television broadcast that informs us about the process or experience in which we will never participate or apply this knowledge.
We'll never repair a car, make a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to look into ancient ruins or remodel the neighbor's home.
