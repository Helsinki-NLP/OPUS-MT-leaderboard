She's not a good cook.
Tom said he's not in a hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about it.
Tom's a member of my home co-op.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lived on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there's no way Tom's gonna do it.
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know Tom might have to do it by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to be doing what he's supposed to be doing.
It would have been tiring to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he'd be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone do that before.
That's not hard.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play drums.
We haven't succeeded yet.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he didn't eat anything, but that wasn't true.
I'm an atheist.
Tom said Mary was at home in bed with a cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that.
Tom said Mary knew she might have to do it alone.
Tom told me he thought Mary was puzzled.
Tom said he'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I looked a little light.
Tom told Mary she should stop pretending to be confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why is everyone staring at us?
I know Tom didn't know who did this to Mary.
I reason that Tom did that because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I'd like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I'd have left early if I could.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's handsome.
Tom was the only one who slept.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
I should never let you go home alone last night.
I think I'll have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at tennis.
Tom told me he thought Mary was autistic.
Tom would've wanted to go to Boston with you.
I know Tom is much more creative than Mary is.
I know Tom is more creative than I am.
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that.
I think you'd all agree that Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom said he's desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom should never have left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he was glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars.
Do you think Tom would like to go to Australia with us?
Tom said he likes to dance with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do that.
I doubt Tom's running for president.
Tom should have done this yesterday.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary wouldn't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do it for him.
Tom said he didn't live in Australia anymore.
I know Tom knew he didn't have to do that.
I hope I haven't forgotten anyone.
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be so angry.
I thought you liked romance novels.
I suspect Tom and Mary are bored.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said he thinks I'd be able to win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I could do what Tom's doing.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
Riches doesn't interest me.
Tom said he thought I looked impressed.
Tom said he had no objection to our leaving early.
It's not for beginners.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were depressed.
I don't think Tom knows how to swim.
Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he cheated.
I think Tom used to be a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'm gonna be as early as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers is it from here to the railroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviors and speech patterns that characterise the advantaged.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking about having dinner at 6:00.
Tom told Mary he'd be doing that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bit him.
Tom said he was through doing that.
Tom said he's appealing to his suspension.
He's deeply attached to her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to assume Tom's dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's been smoking a cigarette in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I don't think that question is appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we gonna do?
I could have cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be happy to help.
I'm pretty sure now that's not going to happen.
They're not as furious as they used to be.
We go to school every day except Sundays.
Tom told me Mary wasn't hungry.
Tom thought he probably wasn't going to survive.
Tom told me he thought Mary was bilingual.
Tom said he thought he'd forgotten to lock the door.
Tom told Mary she should wash her car.
They said they didn't want to argue.
Tom admitted he did what he was accused of doing.
Are you both Canadians?
Why would anyone want to kiss Tom?
I knew Tom never actually did that.
They said they didn't have any other details.
Tom thought Mary liked me, but I knew she hated me.
Tom thinks I have to go.
Tom told everyone he didn't understand French.
They said they don't like to do that.
Not everyone hugged Tom.
Everyone needed to do that.
I thought Tom looked a little blurry.
I turned off the lights.
She's a shopping addict.
Tom said Mary was going home to Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't sleepy.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought you said Tom was a barber.
I wonder if this really works.
Let's get to the point.
Did you give the key to Tom?
Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she had to do it.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to be married to Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom does it on his own often.
I've learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom was gonna buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're very busy right now.
Tom said he was planning to stay home all day.
Tom should have apologized to Mary.
Tom said he believed Mary.
I'm afraid I can't finish this report on time.
Tom was about thirty years old when he moved to Boston.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
Everyone here except Tom and Mary did that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was pleased.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.
I know Tom doesn't know that he doesn't really have to do that.
I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.
I know it's not worth doing.
Tom told me he thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they felt offended.
I am very grateful to you.
Tom's mean.
I knew Tom wasn't as good a student as Mary.
Mary told me she was home.
Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that.
I know Tom's forgetful.
Tom said Mary was mad.
Tom says he's not guilty.
No one laughed at Tom's joke.
Tom said it wasn't his biggest problem.
We're planning to go tomorrow.
I think Tom snores louder than Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know if Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they were planning to go.
You better take your shoes off.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom has already decided that he will sign the contract.
Is it true that you were there?
What do you think Tom would have done?
They say they're not coming.
Tom said he was really glad he was asked to do that.
I think Tom's probably gonna be there tonight.
Tom said he might do that.
Tom told Mary he would never do that again.
I expect Tom's crying right now.
You're really an angel!
Tom has already decided he won't try to escape.
Tom told Mary that either he or she had to do it.
Tom has already decided he won't do that.
Tom's a terrible joke teller, because he often forgets the punch line.
Tom and I are both hungry.
Tom and Mary say they won't do that for you.
Tom told me he thought Mary was trustworthy.
Tom said Mary's probably still scared.
Tom and Mary said they did that on Monday.
Tom doesn't know I never did that.
Tom told me I should go to Boston with Mary.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I'd love to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do this alone.
I was so excited!
Tom's a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom's probably gonna have to do that today.
I hope I don't have to do that.
Tom must have changed a lot.
No one's better at this than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell that he was angry.
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.
My wife is also a scientist.
I turned off the computer.
Tom and Mary told me they weren't ready.
Tom said Mary's probably still mad.
I'm pretty sure Tom has relatives in Australia.
Tom could have waited very easily for us.

They're not here.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't interested in sports.
Tom wasn't impressed.
Tom didn't realize that Mary didn't like him.

I also don't think Tom's going to do that.
Tom was the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
Where do you plan to do that?
I didn't know you'd be through doing that by 2:30.
Tom said he'd be thirteen next month.
I wish I was by your side!
Get your paws off of me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.
I know you recently retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we're really gonna do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should've just walked right in.
I don't think you've been listening to me.
We're brother and sister.
I don't think Tom's done doing that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Don't you have a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play mandolin as well as you.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
The feeling is mutual.
Tom's known Mary since he was a kid.
Tom said he expects to do that on Monday.
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
I think Tom's going to Boston next week.
It's not far from the hotel.
I have to find it.

After the rain, fair weather.

I'm not married yet.
Tom hasn't been told he's not required to do that yet.
I suspect Tom's gonna have to do it next week.
I promised Tom I'd be there by 2:30.
Winning is always hard.
I'm driving a truck.
I'm sure that's not the case.
Tom had no idea Mary was planning to stay in Boston for a few weeks.
I love the fact that Tom's back in Australia.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom said he'd probably do that the day after tomorrow.
They said they weren't unhappy.

I haven't finished my dinner yet.
Tom didn't know you'd be there.
I don't know if Tom and Mary plan to do that or not.
I don't think Tom's still asleep.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do it very well.
I'm sure Tom feels the same way you do.
Tom said he was feeling sick.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that.
I hope no one followed you.
Tom knows he should have been able to do it better.
I know Tom will be motivated to do that.
Do you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom said he wish he didn't give Mary any money.
Tom may not be able to do that.
I know you're not enjoying yourself here.
Kindergarten children act better than some adults.
I thought maybe we could travel together.
I thought I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary's planning to do that.
Tom wanted everyone to know he was unhappy.
I know Tom wanted me to do that.
You look busy.
Tom and Mary both looked at John.
They think they're stronger than me.
I read this in the paper.
How do I improve?
Tom doesn't like doing that.
They told me they'd be discreet.
I should have written it down.
I'm not hungry anymore.
You can do it.
Tom likes to keep things to himself.
I don't think everyone's given up.
I thought you convinced Tom to help us.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to Tom's funeral.
I'm very happy.
I know Tom's gonna do it today.
I know some of your students don't like you.
Kyoko had the kindness to carry my baggage for me.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do it alone.
It's not very likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that next winter.
I don't know what this means.
I think it's more important to discuss possible solutions.
I didn't realize both Tom and Mary should do that.
To Tom and Mary both snore?
It's way past the time Tom promised he'd be here.
We're not going on vacation.
I don't think I'll be able to do what I want to do.
I think Tom's handling it well.
Tom and I know Mary wants to do it tomorrow.
I don't think I can explain the difference.
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't.
I thought everyone here was a vegetarian.
Tom said Mary didn't look happy with him.
Nobody's perfect.
I don't think Tom and Mary have kids yet.
I'm faster than you.
Tom has a twisted sense of humor.
I wish I was someone else.
I didn't know you were scared.
I cried when Tom told me that he and Mary were getting divorced.
I don't think Tom will be cooperative.
Tom and Mary took off their shoes.
I wasn't really planning on doing that.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary has to do that.
Tom said he doesn't mind buying that for you.
Tom won't admit he was wrong.
I'm sorry, but I'm unable to do this.
Tom and Mary said it wasn't as difficult to do that as they expected.
Tom told me he was psyched.
We should have brought lunch.
The leading brand of pop drinks in most countries is Coca-Cola.
Tom didn't have to stay home to help us.
I think Tom's already told us everything we need to know.
I need to buy Tom some new clothes.
I think going to Boston would be fun.
Did anyone tell Tom that he would have to do it tomorrow?
I think Tom should do it himself.

You should tell Tom you're not planning on swimming.
Tom said we needed at least $300 to buy everything we needed.
I know Tom would do it alone.
I thought you were right.
I think Tom will be discouraged.
Tom said Mary was working in Australia.
My father is not talking.
I know Tom won't be forgiven for doing that.
I sure hope Tom gets here on time.
Tom thought Mary was just pretending to be happy.
Do you promise you won't tell Tom I gave you his phone number?
I didn't know you did it yourself.
I think Tom could have solved that problem by himself.
Tom said he'd probably do that.
Tom told me he was headed home.
Tom thinks Mary won't be home on October 20th.
I thought everyone was hungry.
Tom said he'd figure it out.
I know Tom's a strange guy.
We might need to go to Australia next month.
I always knew Tom was destined for greatness.
Did Tom happen to tell you how he plans to do that?
Tom thinks Mary won't be the last one to do that.
How dare you laugh at me!
Tom and Mary say they'd like to win.
I promise I won't tell anyone where it is.

Tom said he stopped drinking.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
Are you sure Tom's gonna do that?
Tom said he didn't have much time left.
Tom and Mary were wondering why everyone was staring at them.
Tom and Mary both know that's not likely to happen.
Tom will stop Mary from doing this.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wasn't having any fun doing that.
I should have talked to Tom first.
I don't think Tom knows how to play the cello.
I think Tom might leave for Boston early tomorrow morning.
Tom says he's not planning on doing that.
Don't tell anyone where Tom is.
Tom said he thought it would be better if we didn't do that here.
They promised they'd do that.
I didn't know you could do that well.
I don't think Tom's gonna be glad that's going to happen.

She's capable of anything.

There's a dog!

I wish you'd told me this earlier.

I thought you said you didn't see Tom this morning.
Tom said he wasn't hurt.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't happy.
Tom called to say he's not coming.
He's just an amateur.
We're giving Tom a birthday party.
They said they thought they could do that.
I wonder if I can do it again.
I feel depressed often.
Tom says he can't prove that Mary did that.
Tom said he thought he had to do it.
I wonder if Tom's done that already.
You should have eaten some cake.
Tom said he doesn't think you need to do that.
Tom and Mary think they have the flu.
Who told you we needed to do that?
Tom said Mary only did that once.
I knew Tom wasn't a very nice guy.
Tom knew he should have done it by himself.
What's cooking in the kitchen?
I'm grateful for your help.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested in doing that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was weird.
They're hiding.
Tom realized he wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that with you.
I'm tired of homework.
I don't think I'm gonna dance with Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I didn't start studying French until I was thirty.
I think Tom's unbeatable.
It should have been easy to achieve.
Tom knew Mary told everyone she wasn't going to go to Boston.
It's not necessary for you to be here anymore.
No one seems to like Tom.
Tom and Mary say they can't trust anyone.
No matter what Tom says, I plan to do it.
I'm proud of you.
It was clear that Tom was going to do it yesterday.
I don't think Tom would be in Australia now.
I should have done that with Tom.
I didn't think anyone was going to help you.

I feel I could have done better.
I thought Tom was kind of cute.
Tom said he wasn't expecting any help from you.

Now we know that's not true.
I don't think Tom sees it that way.
Unfortunately, Apple doesn't provide warranty for accidental damage.
I think Tom likes to do that.

Neither Tom nor Mary have done that yet.
Don't talk nonsense!
Tom said Mary wasn't scared.
I should have helped you do that.
Tom said he'd give Mary a book.
I think Tom can sing country music better than anyone else I know.
Both Tom and Mary saw you.
Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to do that.
I don't know if Tom works there or not.
There's no question about it.
No one could solve the problem.
I won't talk to him anymore.
I think Tom's gonna do that, too.
I shouldn't have let you do that.
I've already met everyone.
Tom said Mary would do that, too.
Tom said he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't wait.
I'm not convinced I should do that.

I didn't know you were gonna let Tom do it alone.
I know Tom might want to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look like she was enjoying herself.
Tom said he thought Mary would be asleep when he got home.
Maybe Tom doesn't know that I hardly ever do that anymore.
It's a deadly poison!
They know they're being watched.
Tom told me he thought Mary could speak French.
Tom might be sleeping.
I know Tom's not a very good manager.
I don't care if you do that or not.
It's not rocket science.
Tom said he wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt lightheaded.
You know you shouldn't do that, right?
Nothing has been done.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
I know Tom knows why we couldn't do that for him.
Tom said he thought that could happen in Boston, too.
I didn't know Tom was an ancom.
I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that.
Tom said I was the one with the problem.
You're not expected to do that, are you?
We'll climb the mountain if it's okay tomorrow.
No one told Tom what to do.
Have you ever hit anyone?
I don't think Tom was mad.
I knew Tom knew how to do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were healthy.
I think that's wrong.
There's a place for everything.
Tom said he wouldn't be allowed to do that anymore.
I told Tom you were hungry.
Tom's pretty sure he saw a wolf.
I don't think it's up to you to decide.
I thought you were retired.
Tom said he hopes Mary won't do it alone.
They said they had to work.
My father won't be busy tomorrow.
They told everyone they were cold.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I was surprised to hear that Tom committed suicide.
I know Tom's a few years younger than I am.
Tom told me he was strong.
Tom and Mary say they can't wait that long.
Tom thinks he should help Mary.
I wonder if Tom really told Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom won't let anyone except Mary drive his car.
I don't think Tom knows why I wanted to do that.
No one else was there.
Tom told Mary he'd decided to stay for a few more days.
I know Tom wasn't the first one to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
I didn't think you'd do that alone.
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
I know Tom's not a bad person.
It's said he knows the secret.
I think Tom would be a good roommate.
Tom said that Mary thought he might be required to do that.
I know Tom didn't know who did this for him.
Tom said he was okay.
Why didn't you tell me you didn't want my help?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that today.
I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I'm as happy as I can be.
If they knew what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know he didn't want to do that.
Tom's rich, but he's not as rich as Mary.
Go wake Tom and tell him that breakfast is ready.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still up.
I should have left early.
Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do it by herself.
Tom said his failure was due to bad luck.
I didn't think Tom would be alone.
Tom said he wasn't planning on buying anything.
She needs to be taken to the hospital.
Things didn't go the way I hoped.
Tom said he didn't think he'd get there until after dark.
Tom said Mary knew he wanted to do it again.
I know Tom's careless.
Let me know if there's anything I can do.
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he would go to Australia with her.
The bus arrived ten minutes behind time.
Tom's not home right now.
Tom said he likes skiing, too.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this matter with you.
I don't think you should have done that by yourself.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not want to do that until it gets cooler.
I didn't think Tom was annoyed.
Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary did that.
Tom said he's faster at doing that than Mary is.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot.
I didn't know Tom was supposed to do it alone.
We split up the robbery three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that alone.
Tom told me I was pretty.
What time does the show start?
Tom knows he has to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom probably won't go jogging with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who did this to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said he didn't know if he'd be able to do that.
I know Tom couldn't do that.
Keep left at the next traffic lights.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Were you afraid the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big supermarket.
I suspected Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom's gonna be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom might not have enough money to buy anything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing it soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today is October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on going.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I don't think that book is that interesting.
I was told that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is going to keep getting better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom definitely knows he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom's gonna be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn yourself in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
No one will know I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed more exercise.
Tom told me he'd try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do it.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's worried.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was gonna be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do it alone.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said it wasn't going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You will stay here until you are summoned.
My daughter is being trained in a toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
No one suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom's a pretty good painter.
I know Tom is a picky eater and rarely tries anything new.
Tom says he did nothing illegal.
I suspect Tom knows that Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a schmuck.
Everyone was late except me.
He couldn't resist temptation.
Tom's probably gonna get mad if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a Liberarian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom's gonna have to do it alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom's a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom's a bully.
He's the smartest boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't get jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired of him.
I doubt Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning on going anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't actually want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom is about the same height as you.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book that he'd lent her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married yet.
They said they were planning on going Monday.
It won't be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was done.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Has anyone else hugged Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to.
We were married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that any better.
I know Tom didn't do it right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better in French than she really is.
Tonight I'm free.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
It's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should have tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do it today.
They promised to check on it.
I'm sure Tom would've agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do it on his own.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there that matters.
Tom must have fought.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance Tom might get hurt.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom's really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good in French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as flexible as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in grave danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just hard-coiled an egg for myself.
Do you have a pen with you?
I don't think Tom's going to be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably won't be able to buy anything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they declined that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom is a really close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom would probably agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting that I go out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom's gonna give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
I'd have done it myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary did that.
Tom and Mary swore they'd never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy over there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom's the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's amused by what's going on?
We haven't started fighting yet.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom's the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said he thought what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one comes.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom study.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forgotten about that.
Tom told everyone he was through doing that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do it again.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little bit.
I know Tom's a lot taller than I am.
I thought that was what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's faster at doing that than Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom's gonna tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom's gonna be able to do that.
Tom thought it was hard.
We've walked all over the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work Mondays.
I don't think Tom's as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do anything like that.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed away last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as my sister.
Tom's read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's done enough already.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do it.
We better tell the others.
Why is everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing it himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will he be finished?
You're a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning on doing that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail these days we have an e-mail.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it probably is.
Tom said he hopes you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he wasn't there.
I thought you said you wanted to come with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in any hurry.
We might need to be in Australia for a few weeks.
I didn't plan on doing that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know Tom's a little shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll make it.
You know Tom and I'm not gonna do that, right?
Tom and Mary told me they were done doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should have turned left back there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought you might not be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he'd forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate right now.
I knew Tom knew who to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom's a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not feasible with current technology.
They said they're trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do it alone.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that.
I assume you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humor.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom's capable of that.
Tom didn't know he had to do it alone.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I don't think Tom would refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom's gonna like this wine.
I believe we spoke on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom's a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom's going to have to do it eventually.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet.
I know Tom's a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A wolf can't be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he was supposed to be doing.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't get paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll make sure it's done.
I wear a suit but no ties.
I'm as tired as you are.
Tom thought he might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got in the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I puked.
Tom's not very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We're gonna need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do it tomorrow.
You're both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I don't think Tom will stop doing that anytime soon.
Have I ever told you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was 13 years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do it alone.
I wonder if Tom's motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I don't think Tom would like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you'd do that.
Mary let me know that she wasn't planning on staying very long.
I didn't know you were gonna be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had kids.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom might be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that won't happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary's planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary likes him or not.
I lost myself in the woods.
I know Tom's a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he might have to do it on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that he had to do it.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Do you have a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait till 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it's gonna take him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did it.
Tom said he's been trying to do that all week.
You have really beautiful teeth!
No one knew Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that was going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done doing that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason Tom's not here.
It's not right to be late for dinner party.
Tom told me he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary's scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom's a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's too emotional.
I'm immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was cancelled.
Tom and Mary told me to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he'd be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'm gonna be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to begin.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I don't think Tom will be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know Tom wasn't planning on doing that?
I know Tom knew who was going to do this for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary is not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise bothered Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows that we are.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same way.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will get lost.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the chance to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have been doing that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be mad.
Tom and Mary say they're feeling better now.
They hate strangers; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom's coming tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom's the only one who has to do it.
I didn't think you'd win.
I don't think Tom will have time to do that with us today.
I know Tom is very thoughtful.
We can't let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pigs.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
I already told Tom I didn't plan on doing that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
Pleasure to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are the ones who did it.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying anything than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that.
Tom just turned the radio on.
Tom has already decided he won't say yes.
I know Tom's a little snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do it alone.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done it alone if he could.
Admitting that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she was planning on going.

If you'd left home a little early, you'd be on time.

Tell Tom I'm coming.

Tom said he assumed you'd do that.
They are fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
No one knows exactly where Tom's going.
You should make sure you don't make Tom angry.
I didn't know we weren't supposed to do it alone.
Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not gonna try to kill me?
I wonder if Tom really went to Boston.
Tom said he considered doing that.
I don't think Tom's gonna be alone.
I can't figure out why he did that.

You never know what's going to happen tomorrow.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needs to do that.

I figured it had to be good.
It might be good to do that.

If I knew Tom's address, I'd write to him.

This isn't surprising at all.

Tom said he couldn't do everything he had planned to do.

Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could rely on you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know Tom didn't have to do it alone.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me he was hesitant to do that.
I pretended I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom's a boom.
I didn't think Tom would let you do that.
I want to go and change into that shirt I bought yesterday.
Tom said he thought Mary was lying.
We should have stayed with you.
I don't think Tom's lonely.
This isn't the first time I've done this.
If Tom can't do that, neither can anyone else.
I thought Tom might stop by this afternoon.
I think the economic impact will be minimal.
You should let Tom know that Mary is going to do that.

Did you know Tom was planning to move to Boston?

Tom said he thought Mary wasn't done doing that.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
I would never do that to you.
Tom should have been faster at doing that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they were planning on going on Monday.
That's not really what Tom needs.
They know they can do better.
There's no way Tom would have done what you said he did.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do it alone?
Tom and Mary said they used to study French.
Tom admitted he'd killed Mary.
I'd have been there by now if my car hadn't broken down.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you were going to kill me.
I think there's a possibility Tom's gonna do it.
It's surprising they should have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot going on right now.
I wonder if Tom's rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom did.
I think you're bossy.
Tom backed his car up to check, but the raccoon he ran over was dead as a doorstep.
Tom and Mary said they're not mad.
I wonder if Tom ever told Mary about what we did that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia because everyone else in his family did.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to go to the prom.
Are you sure no one can see us?
He's got a great fancy for traveling.

I'm not sure Tom would let anyone help Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were jealous.
Tom and Mary told me they were homesick.
I think you know we need to buy more food.
I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French.
Tom must have left his umbrella on the bus.
They told me they're broke.
No one but Tom did that.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that that happened.
I guess you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to be understood by everyone.
I'm hungry.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one's seen them.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he'd definitely do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom's a student at Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing it the wrong way.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was glad that was going to happen.
If it wasn't for the storm, I'd have arrived sooner.
They said they'd do it for us.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
Tom said he thought the prices at that store were too high.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses.
I thought you said I could count on you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother gave him on books.
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.
Tom and Mary say they'll only talk to you.
Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did.
I parked my car here many times and nobody complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going home.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom's planning to get here?
I know you're not planning on staying in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't abide looking at it.
I don't think Tom knows Mary can speak French.
Currently available evidence does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary has to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wanted to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt repulsed.
I know Tom's afraid he'll get lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried to.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everyone knows Tom's lying.
They're not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I'd go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same way.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom decided he wasn't going to work today.
Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not gonna work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do it by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I would have been unable to do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do it alone.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should have anticipated that Tom wouldn't agree with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom wasn't aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination to this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan on doing that until I tell her that.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have entered your children months ago.
I don't think that's mine.
I believe Tom's 30 years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anyone's ever done such a thing before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd get lost.
Tom said he should do it.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning on doing that tomorrow?
There were times I'd have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote all the caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do it alone.
If I were you, I'd go home at once.
It's not like you knew what they were gonna do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape.
I thought you jury-rigged something.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom's the only man I'd ever consider getting married.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
Tom told me he thought Mary was paralyzed.
I know Tom's not planning on doing that.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as hard as it sounds.
Tom and Mary shouted, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swim.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning on joining the team.
You promised not to be rude to me anymore.
Tom thought it would take longer.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do it.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would want you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
I think Tom's still undecided.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom said he'd do his homework before dinner.
Tom stared at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom's really asleep.
Tom and Mary said they wanted to die.
Tom said he had enough of that.
I suspect Tom's on vacation.
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom's very bright.
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John got here.
Doing that would have been easy.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do it by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The kind of information we need is not always available.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I didn't have to do that, did you?
Tom suspected it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sat down.
Tom was wearing the tie Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
The question is not so much what it is like how it looks.
I know Tom's almost always right, but this time he's not.
Tom said doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do it alone.
Tom must have had a key.
Tom knew there was a possibility that Mary would do that.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were starved.
It's not socially acceptable to point at people.
Tom would have let Mary do that.
I wish we'd stayed in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you said you'd never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary's planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time Tom did that this week.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that today.
Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
Tom said he had a lottery in his pickup truck.
It was clear that Tom liked doing it on his own.
I don't think that what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was scared.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I thought I'd find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's doing okay.
Tom said he thought he didn't have to do that.
Tom said that Mary knew that he might not want to do that until John had time to help him.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I should never have gotten you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do it.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool?
Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
Tom said he thought Mary would probably want to do that.
Tom said he'd come, but he never showed up.
I doubt Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
Tom's gonna be able to do that eventually.
The doctor advised me to leave jogging because it was an excessive exercise.
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was.
I don't think Tom's coming back.
No one was on the bus.
Tom said he was hoping Mary could win.
Tom thought he'd lost his wallet, but eventually found it after searching the house for an hour or so.
Tom told me he wasn't impressed.
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here.
It was clear Tom hadn't done that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street.
Tom said he thought I might have to do it soon.
Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that has to be done today, don't you?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
She took him by the hand.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did it wrong.
I knew Tom might get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be courteous.
I guess that's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cape?
Tom said Mary was able to do that, too.
That's a mistake a lot of people make.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know Tom's a lot younger than Mary is.
It's not an easy solution.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should've stayed longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
There's no doubt Tom's gonna do that for us.
I don't have anything to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what I'm planning on doing.
The men are wearing short sleeves.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
I knew that eventually this would happen.
It's not hard to guess what's going to happen.
Tom will never hurt anyone.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be required to do it by himself.
I thought everyone knew.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be amused by what was going on.
Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
It's not a secret anymore.
Tom told me he didn't know Mary.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
Tom thought Mary was John's girlfriend.
I can't stand this noise.
I know Tom is much better at doing that than Mary.
The police believe Tom and Mary were killed.
I guarantee that won't happen.
Tom claims he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's tough.
Tom decided he'd say yes.
I hope Tom's not dead.
They said they didn't do that.
Tom knows this is a difficult situation.
Tom knew that what he was going to do would make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be mad.
Tom said Mary was willing to do the cooking.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should have done that with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know Tom's a pretty good swimmer.
Tom hasn't been appointed president yet.
I wonder if there's any cheese left in the fridge.
What are you good at?
I wonder if Tom and Mary were supposed to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to work late.
I suspect Tom and Mary both have houses in Australia.
Tom said he thought Mary was the only one who had to do it.
Tom said he was hoping you'd win.
I think Tom and Mary are both going to get fired.
I thought that was your job.
Tom told me John was a terrible roommate.
I wonder if Tom's reliable.
I think Tom's gonna do it too.
I knew Tom was studying.
I know Tom's the owner of the gun.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the station by a taxi.
No one's done it yet.
Tom said he didn't want me to worry.
I know Tom's gonna do that with me this afternoon.
We're not planning on doing this together.
Let's see why your answers differ from mine.
They told me they disagreed.
I don't think Tom was upset.
Tom knows he should do that, but he doesn't want to.
Tom is also a member of our group.
My parents don't let me do that.
They told me they didn't win.
Tom said he wasn't having fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
They say they like marigolds.
"Does everyone talk about me?" "No, Tom, you're not that important."
I don't think it's gonna be hard to do that.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Are both Tom and Mary still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew Tom wasn't done doing that yet.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom should go home.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be alone.
I promise I won't hit anyone.
Tom said he'd try to do it today.
Both Tom and Mary used to live on Park Street.
I know Tom knows that Mary should do that.
Tom said he felt much happier now.
Tom said he doesn't even want to think about it.
The joke's on you.
I'm determined to give up smoking.
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right now.
Tom told me he liked snow.
Tom and Mary should never have done that together.
Every man can't be happy.
I promise I won't do that.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
I swear I'll tell you everything someday.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during the rising tides of prosperity and still waters of peace. Yet, every so often, the oath is taken in the midst of gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because we People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebearers, and true to our founding documents.
Tom didn't know Mary went to Boston.
I was the only one there who knew Tom wanted to do that.
Tom says he intends to win.
I know Tom rarely does that anymore.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still alone.
I don't think I'd enjoy doing that outside in the winter.
The rumour spread quickly.
There's no way you're going out dressed like that.
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we'll all die.
You're embarrassing.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do it tomorrow.
It's not that weird, is it?
I didn't know I was breaking any laws.
Do you promise me you'll do that?
You should tell Tom he's not likely to win.
They say they're willing to help.
There's a possibility that it's real.
I know I did the right thing.
Tom says he despises Mary.
I suspect Tom's in there.
I knew Tom was a pretty good jazz saxophone player, that's why I wanted him to join our band.
I think Tom's trying to trick us.
Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to buy a birthday present for Mary.
Tom probably can't do that any faster than Mary can.
Both Tom and Mary have put some weight on since the last time I saw them.
Are you planning to tell Tom and Mary why you wanted them to do that?
If Tom could have spoken French, he'd have had more fun.
I don't think Tom was excited.
I suspect Tom's probably gonna do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's still depressed.
Tom said he never agreed to do that.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's in the hospital.
I must have overlooked something.
Tom plans to leave Boston next year.
What's Tom's problem?
I know Tom would be happy to do that.
Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to help John do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was healthy.
It's not you, it's me!
I thought you were going to stay with Tom.
I don't think Tom's involved.
Tom said he didn't plan to do it alone.
Tom said that Mary thought he might want to do it tonight.
I thought Tom had already been compensated for that.
I promise I'll be there to help you.
Tom said he thought I didn't look like I was enjoying myself.
There's no reason Tom wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he'd try.
Tom said he was planning to stay in Australia next summer.
There's a chance Tom was wrong.
I'm fat.
I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary not to do that anymore.
Tom told me he needed space.
Let's go to the beach.
Tom seems to have many friends.
Tom may not have enough money to buy what he needs.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can do that.
Tom really should have eaten more for breakfast.
Tom and Mary told me they were terrified.
Tom told Mary he was happy.
Tom said he was tired of waiting.
Why do you suspect Tom was the one who did that?
Tom said he was having fun hanging out with us.
The earthquake crushed everything.
I knew we should have brought more food with us.
They put their bathing suits on.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today.
I'm sorry I made you so unhappy.
I don't think Tom has much experience doing that.
Tom said he didn't mind eating after the kids ate.
In France, the first name comes before the surname.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that.
I'm pretty sure both Tom and Mary have passed away.
I know Tom knew he shouldn't have done that.
They know they're in real trouble now.
Tom said he thought Mary could do that.
I didn't know you weren't planning on doing it by yourself.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary shouldn't be doing that.
I know Tom is a selfish person.
Mary says she's not planning on going.
Do you plan to do that?
I'm sorry Tom had to leave so early.
I was hoping you'd tell me everything yourself.
There's nothing to apologize for.
I'd rather go swimming.
I've been planning on doing that for months.
I'm sorry I was so slow.
Tom and Mary said they didn't eat meat anymore.
I'm surprised Tom won.
It's possible.
Tom said he needed to take a nap.
I promised Tom I'd wait.
Tom said he hoped Mary would help him.
Tom told me he believed Mary.
Tom hasn't quit yet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be able to do that.
Tom knew there was a possibility that Mary would do that.
Please come in.
I don't think that's gonna happen anymore.
Tom said that Mary thought he was the only one who knew how to do that.
Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
I didn't know you were gonna be nervous.
I know you don't like me, but we have to work together.
I know you should do that.
I was surprised Tom didn't come yesterday.
A true friend would have helped.
I know Tom's gonna love it.
Tom told me he thought I should lose weight.
Tom said he'd rather do it next week.
I think Tom is predecessor.
I thought it was a mistake to tell Tom where we buried the treasure.
I haven't called back yet.
Tom said Mary didn't look much older than John.
Tom's probably a little younger than I am.
You're out of danger.
It's not worth fixing this camera.
I know that's not true.
They promised they'd do it this week.
I don't think I've ever been this hungry before.
I knew Tom would help Mary do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't accept our offer.
Tom said he thought he'd be able to help us today.
Tom knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway.
Tom told me he thought Mary was glad that that was going to happen.
I don't think I have any chance of winning.
My mother was sick, I couldn't go to the concert.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might want to do it tonight.
Tom and Mary said they were very sad.
I don't think my vote will change anything.
Tom's back in the junk.
What makes you think it was Tom who did this?
We both agreed with Tom.
I know Tom won't have to do it alone.
I know Tom's not a very reasonable man.
They promised to be here on Monday.
I thought it would be hard for her to get the tickets.
Tom said he'd do that too.
I thought Tom was a computer programmer.
Tom said he'd help me figure out how to do that.
I know Tom is a better singer than Mary is.
Tom's Mary's father.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
Tom denied knowing anything about the bank robbery.
Everyone knows I hate you.
She'll be in the hospital for a month next Monday.
Tom said he saw Mary spanking one of her kids.
That's something I should have done a long time ago.
I didn't know Tom had only one leg.
Hello again.
The show's on Wednesday.
I'm home right now.
Soon I found out that I wasn't talented enough.
I don't think anyone suspected you weren't really Tom.
Go away and leave me alone!
You should tell Tom that Mary's planning to do that.
It's not always easy to tell the difference between good and bad.
Tom's even a liar than Mary.
That's not funny.
I don't think anyone could have stopped Tom.
Tom didn't think he had a chance to succeed, but at least he wanted to give it a shot.
I suspect Tom's already left for Australia.
They told me they were sick.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
I don't think I can do that tonight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was next.
Tom and Mary put down their spoons.
What will the neighbors think?
Tom said he hopes you try your best to win.
How did you know I needed to do that?
Tom already asked me not to do that.
Tom said he wished he didn't tell Mary he'd do it.
Tom said he wouldn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her room listening to music.
I don't think that's realistic.
I don't think that's right.
They told me they're done doing that.
Tom should have known this.
I know Tom doesn't know I don't want to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary could play the saxophone.
I don't think I can love two people at the same time.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
There's a serious problem.
I wonder if I should do that.
I don't think that's going to happen today.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom's good at his job.
Tom said Mary does that often.
Rape survivors are more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder than survivors of other traumatic experiences.
I thought Tom would be the next one to do that.
No one remembered that today was my birthday.
I know Tom saved Mary's life.
I think Tom's alone in his room.
I know Tom didn't really have to do that.
Tom wasn't the one who gave Mary that.
Tom told me I'm slow.
I didn't do that as much last week as I usually do.
Tom told me he was over thirty.
Tom and Mary showed me the letter they received from John.
Tom said he thought Mary would have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would want to do that.
Tom was the one who told me you shouldn't do that.
I didn't think anyone would argue that.
I know Tom is a much better singer than I am.
Tom said he thought Mary was likely to cry.
Tom thinks he's the only person in town who can play the bagpipes.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary often eat together?
Tom told me he thought Mary was out.
They said they were exhausted.
Tom's written a lot of books.
Tom and Mary both want to eat steak for dinner.
I know you probably want some help.
I'm sorry I made you worry.
Tom said he was planning on going to Australia next summer.
I wonder what Tom's planning to buy.
I don't think Tom knows I hate him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was deaf.
I don't think Tom's ever done that.
Send him to me!
Tom said he didn't plan to go this week.
Do you do the same with your children?
Tom said he was starving.
Tom and Mary say they can't do that.
He has to see a specialist.
I knew that would happen.
I know Tom's in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary knows how to do it very well.
I didn't think Tom would be worried about something like that.
Is this the first time you ever gave blood?
Did you have tea?
Tom was unable to find Mary a good job.
My bike has a flat tire.
I know Tom was shaken.
Good night!
It's all gonna be okay.
Tom's convinced everyone hates him.
I know Tom's gonna do it for you.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
They say they didn't have to do that.
I know I'm rambling.
I thought you said it was getting fixed.
He respects you.
Tom and Mary told me they were miserable.
They told me they'd call you later.
I know Tom knew that Mary knew how to do that.
Tom said Mary went to Australia.
Why isn't there any food in the fridge?
Tom told me he liked it.
I know Tom knows who did this to Mary.
I've read a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary was confused.
You should let Tom know you can't do that.
I thought Tom would be safe here.
Tom thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore.
No one answered my questions.
Tom told me he wasn't planning on doing that.
I think Tom could have gotten home by himself.
You should have seen me.
He was a prophet of God.
Doing that won't be as hard as you think.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still homesick.
I'm surprised Tom remembers me.
If you asked for my advice, I'd advise you not to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to hang out with Mary anymore.
Tom thought Mary might not have to do that anymore.
I wasn't aware Tom was supposed to do that.
They're surprised.
I like foreign languages!
What have you been watching?
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he thought it would be better not to go outside.
It may not be as hard to do as you think it will be.
We're in the same time zone.
I thought you both knew Tom and Mary were allergic to peanuts.
They knew they wouldn't win.
Tom and Mary said they agreed to do that.
It's a beautiful day!
You're more than welcome to come over.
They said they'd do it later.
He can speak Russian, too.
Tom said he wanted it, so I gave it to him.
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
I knew Tom wouldn't eat the stew Mary made for him.
Tom said he thought I was lazy.
I wonder if Tom wants to dance.
Tom must be reluctant to do that.
Tom's speech wasn't as boring as Mary's.
Tom died without telling his secret to anyone.
Tom knows Mary's angry.
They know they have to do it soon.
Call me anything but late for dinner.
We didn't see a single game.
Tom said he'd rather not spend much time doing that.
I think Tom stays at his grandparents' house whenever he visits Boston.
I don't think Tom wants to do that anymore.
I know Tom tried to do that.
I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
I think Tom's careless.
I think Tom should wait till at least 2:30 before he leaves.
I thought Tom would be present at today's meeting.
Tom said that Mary knew he might be required to do that.
That would have been the smart thing to do.
I think Tom's gonna listen to me.
I could have sworn something moved.
Tom said he thought it might happen in Boston, too.
I didn't think anyone could have stopped Tom.
I want to know if Tom and Mary need to do that, too.
I suspect Tom and Mary are exhausted.
The world is not as scary as you think.
I think Tom's deranged.
I know you don't want to do that, but you need to.
Let's hope that's enough time.
Tom's one of the ugliest people I know.
I'm very glad to see you.
I didn't think anyone suspected you weren't Tom.
We're late.
Tom told everyone he was starving.
Tom told me he knew how to speak French.
I'm absolutely sure Tom's wrong.
I thought I'd give it another try.
I thought it was strange that Tom wasn't at Mary's party.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unbiased.
I don't think you should have left early.
Tom said Mary probably wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that anymore.
I had no idea you knew Tom.
We'll discuss this problem later.
I don't think Tom has anyone to help him.
How's it going?
Tom thinks he can do whatever he wants.
I know I can't do that as well as Tom can.
I know Tom's planning to do it tomorrow.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be interested.
It's not particularly hot today.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.
Tom said he didn't think he could do that kind of thing.
If you don't go, I won't either.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know Tom doesn't know I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought Mary didn't like him.
Tom said he did nothing illegal.
Tom said he already did that.
I think you're gonna be okay.
I knew Tom was still willing to do that.
Tom told Mary that he was glad that that happened.
The computer has stopped working.
We know you're not stupid.
She didn't show up after all.
We both know that's a lie.
Tom knows we're not supposed to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom's in Australia now.
I don't think Tom knows exactly what he should be doing.
Both Tom and Mary can do that.
I thought you might know.
Tom's flacky.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom was aware they were following him.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in big trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would never have done that if Mary had asked him not to.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder to do than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom's going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're healed.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite fast food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we could do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
The clock has stopped.
Tom and I both grew up in Boston.
Tom said he was an artist.
I don't think Tom will be back soon.
I didn't think we had enough money.
You should have heard me, I shouted as loud as I could.
I'm giving you what you want.
I knew Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him.
I know Tom's a good writer.
They said they'd never want to do that.
They said they'd eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it's gonna rain tonight.
I love you and I always will.
No. No.
I know Tom's not a very good hitter.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they'd be willing to help us.
It's not open to debate.
Tom told everyone that he was unemployed.
I know that's gonna be hard to do.
How do you plan to do that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a little out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you'd learned that by now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom's just as smart as Mary.
They wish they didn't say that.
I wonder if Tom's planning on quitting his job.
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know Tom's probably gonna know how to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite singer?
I promise I'll help you.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do it again.
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train.
I'm a lot taller than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French, and I wonder if Mary can, too.
I know Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I suppose this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do so much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he didn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he'd probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt very seriously that Tom did it on purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do it by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something the other night about that.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston anymore.
I suspect Tom's waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that alone.
Tom doesn't think we're gonna find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom's not as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do it alone.
Tom says Mary's still planning on doing that.
I thought Tom had to be wrong.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fallen in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about that.
Tom's liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He doesn't have a cell phone.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do it alone.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom's involved.
How many pounds have you lost?
Both Tom and Mary are fine.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he was sleepy.
Mary tried her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted he stole Mary's bike.
I snuck off the pond.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I'd have helped you.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for over a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary already had a driver's license.
I know Tom's a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should have done it alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weatherwave.
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they'd do it again.
Tom's thrown up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to be married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like another cup of coffee.
I assume Tom's still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know Tom can probably do that sometime today.
Do you let your kids play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom's unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom's moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done it by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was delusional.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary's thirsty.
They said they didn't enjoy doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they'd never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's uncertain about what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't probably have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there on time.
I think both Tom and Mary are gonna be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do it.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he didn't plan on going with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for $300.
Everybody loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me Mary should do that.
I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do it or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he should do it.
Tom doesn't think Mary's annoying.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom's not as tall as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat bothered Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I already promised Tom I'd help him.
I believe everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do it today.
I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
Tom said he knew Mary was the one who did it.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted three hours.
I wonder if Tom's alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom might be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know someone cares.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he'd never be coming back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do it alone.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom's irresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom's more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have much choice.
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom's a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom did that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done it better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I don't think Tom did that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know Tom is the one who should tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by yourself.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that won't happen.
Tom's planning to sit in the back.
Tom said he'd given a book to Mary.
It would have been unbearable.
I know Tom's probably gonna know how to do that.
I know Tom was a scrawny kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly guilty.
I'm not surprised Tom plans to do that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't twist my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job would be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your jacket on if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning on staying in Australia very long.
I hear you've given up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do it alone.
Tom said he was good at speaking French.
This isn't salt.
Has anyone seen Tom here?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room as I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he was planning on doing that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary was careful.
Tom was sleeping on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do it yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go to a picnic if it's okay tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection, it's Mary.
They said they're irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did it whenever he could.
They said their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things to do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary she should stop pretending to be sleepy.
Can someone please help me?
I know Tom's about the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom's a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that alone.
Tom thought he could do it tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy-going.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to settle into her new apartment.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore they would never do that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do it myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary's sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wish they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary by now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom's guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
That's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were kids.
It is not until you have lost your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house isn't big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning on joining the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom doesn't have a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one who had to do it.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom I'd do that.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said doing that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom threw his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says he and Mary are gonna spend Christmas together.
Why did you fail in the entrance exam?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were bored.
Tom said he was glad you were coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there will be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom is reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They're inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Could you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home alone.
Tom needs to be irritated.
How long has your head been hurting?
Thanks, bud!
Tom said no one was fired.
Do you think we should've gone where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He's got earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do it alone.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without a parole.
I suppose the shot I heard was the one that killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom's a millionaire.
Tom said he thought doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'm gonna let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I did that.
I don't think Tom eats meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom's a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I don't think Tom's gonna be the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that's not very likely to happen.
They say that drugs aren't safe.
I know it's very unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom's a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he'd be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I guess you still enjoy drinking beer.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should be talking to.
Sammy knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You got a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know you already did that?
Tom ate more than I ate.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary's probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I'd want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early anymore.
I know Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time, it is taken away.
I think Tom's conceited.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll stop doing that.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he didn't think he'd enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
Maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom would be able to do that without any help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else do you plan to do?
I think Tom understands everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's talking.
It's none of my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I assume you'd like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door shut.
My grandma texts faster than you.
To both Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was gonna be in Australia all week?
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was gonna leave him.
You're not still scared, are you?
I thought you'd cry.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it's going to cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary's planning on doing that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't gonna do it again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary felt sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom's not the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I've despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the TV guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak French well.
Look at that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should stop pretending to be handicapped.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever it takes.
Tom said he owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after dark alone.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do it tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one course of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I don't think Tom's made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary they're not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that today.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for over a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said that Mary knew he didn't want to do it until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom's now.
I don't think Tom's really gonna win.
I'd want to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do it by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he'd look at it.
Tom said doing it was harder than he thought it would be.
You'd love the movie.
They told me they didn't really care what happened.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French?
I'm a doer damage.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could've gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see Tom is happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have much time.
Tom said he was trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom is the funniest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't have to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom's gonna do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you might walk Mary home.
Tom said he hopes Mary's trying to do it.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.
Tom didn't tell me where he was planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.
Tom told me he lost his textbook.
No one knew Tom was going to do that.
That's right!
I thought I might have to do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't have any brothers.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I doubt that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are really telling the truth.
Do you all think this is a good idea?

I'm really tired of living.

Do you have children?
Tom said he's glad he didn't do it.
I wonder if Tom's really done.
I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me he thought Mary was too young to drive.
I'll be back.
I don't think Tom's nosy.
I would never have done that.
I believe we don't actually have to do this.
Tom could have been faster at doing that than Mary if he'd tried harder.

I didn't think anyone could do this.
How do we know you're not lying to us?
I think you'd all agree Tom is one of our best singers.
Tom didn't know Mary was in pain.
I'd have gone to Boston if I could.
You were planning to take pictures, weren't you?
I don't think Tom knows what he has to buy.
He's happy.

The gods are pleased with your actions.

It would have been better if you hadn't gone there.

You're not going to give up, are you?
Tom said he wouldn't walk home today.
Most people think they're above average.
Tom told me he thought Mary was a ticklish.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
He went to America last year to brush his English.
Tom said Mary probably won't do that.
Tom's probably gonna want to do that on a day like this.
Tom never mentioned he had a girlfriend.
I knew Tom wasn't a very good singer.

They said they felt tempted to do that.
The atomic number of iron is 26.
Is this the first time you've ever had ice skated?
You better go get dressed.
It's a complete disaster.
They say they're not having any fun.
I wish I'd gone to Australia with Tom.
You're not answering me.
I didn't think Tom would help me do that.
Both Tom and Mary need this.
Tom thought Mary probably did that.
I thought I might have to do that.
Does Tom and Mary know you did that?
Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that.
Tom thinks I'm a loser.
Tom knows he should do it soon.

This is so bad, it's good.

It seems to me you're wrong.
I thought you'd laugh.

Tom thought Mary was homesick.
They say they enjoy teaching French.
Tom didn't tell anyone he needed to do that.
Tom said he's not sleepy.
I thought Tom paid Mary, but apparently I was wrong.
Please wake me up at 6:00 tomorrow morning.

Leave the dog out!

I should have kissed Mary.
I thought you said you saw Tom do that.
Tom said that Mary thought he might want to do that tonight.
It must have been a shock to you.
Tom and I were both wrong.
All our blood goes through our kidneys about 60 times a day.
I don't think doing that is a bad idea.
She pressed her nose against the glass.
I don't think anyone really thought Tom was happy.
We should have gone to Boston last month.
Tom should do it somewhere else.
I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
I need a doctor!
Tom thought it wasn't the first time Mary did that.

I won't be able to come into work today because I have to take my son to the hospital.
Is that your car?
Tom's looking for someone to teach French to his children.

Go and see if Mr. Wilson's home.
I think Tom's fair.

This bridge is built of stone.
I didn't know Tom knew why Mary kept doing that.
There's no doubt.
I know I made a mistake, but you don't need to rub it in!
Tom's the best.
I don't think Tom's gonna mind.
Both Tom and Mary are afraid of John's dog.
I assumed Tom would want to do that.

You had best follow the doctor's advice.
Tom said he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
I think Tom's annoying.
Tell Tom he should visit Australia.
Tom and Mary said they felt disappointed.
I still make a lot of mistakes.
He walks a lot.
I didn't think Tom would ever forgive Mary for doing that.
Tom has a car, but he rarely uses it.
Let's go out for some shoulders.
I'm convinced I'm right.
Tom told me I was last.
Tom might not be willing to do that for you.
I thought you said you'd rather not do that.
I wonder if Tom could help us solve this problem.
I don't know if Tom and Mary still live in Boston or not.
Tom said he didn't think he'd ever do that.
I hope Tom's coming to Australia with you.

I wish I could have spoken French.
Tom told me he did it for us.
Tom likes to play with this dog.
I'm wasting my time.
Tom said Mary should do that in the other room.
I should have advised Tom not to believe what Mary said.
I think Tom hasn't left yet.
I already said I'd do that.
Remember we're all in the same boat.
I wonder if we forgot to tell Tom to do that.
You're a genius.
Tom and Mary think they might have the answer.
I think Tom may have done this.

I think we'd better wait another thirty minutes.
I didn't know Tom knew anyone who could do that.
I should have known Tom and Mary would be together.
Tom told me he and Mary spent their summer vacation at the beach.
Everyone but Tom knew Mary was in love with him.
I suspect Tom and Mary are able to do that.
They're wrong.
I don't think Tom would have had any fun doing that.
They said they knew I was coming.
I don't want to be here any more than you do.
Is Tom planning to stay home all day alone?
I know Tom will be faster at doing that than Mary.
I know Tom's a snob.
I'm not sure I need to do that.

You may not be able to do that.
Tom will be very upset if that happens.
I wish I was better in French.

Something's happened to her.

Now you mention it, I can smell it, too.
Are you suggesting I'm lying?
Tom talked to Mary as well.
Tom said Mary wasn't desperate.
I don't think Tom knows who's going to help Mary do that.
You've confused the students.
I suspect Tom's coming to Boston.
It's not safe to drink this water.
I know you don't know how to speak French.
You could have warned me.
Mr. Tatuya deals with grain.
I'm almost sure that's not the case.
Tom told me he's not gonna do that.
I think we can change that.
I want to know that what I'm doing is right.

It wasn't a pleasant experience.
Tom said he couldn't remember anything.
I'm familiar with the way he asks questions.

I thought Tom was interested in golf.
Where did you get those shoes?
I think something's wrong.
My brother is now in Australia.
I think Tom's plan is better than Mary's.
I need to get some shut-eye.
I'm an introvert.
I should never have come to Boston.

You're not helping much.
I knew Tom was already done doing that.
I thought you were teaching Tom French.
They said they'd think about it.
Tom said he knew Mary might be allowed to do that in the near future.
Tom left about thirty minutes ago.
Tom said he was glad Mary could do that.
I'm a high school graduate so I'm so much able to answer high school problems and stuff.
I wonder if Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom will do whatever you ask.
I know you're not stupid enough to believe that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary and I would really be able to do that by ourselves.
Tom should have refused to leave early.

I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should do that.
I didn't think Tom would be fired.

Tom will be here for another three days.
Tom hardly ever does that anymore.
I suspect Tom's optimistic.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unmarried.
I'm sure I can overcome any difficulty.
I don't think you need to tell Tom what he needs to do.
They knew they should do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom can help Mary.
I know you did this.
I'm very worried about my future.
How could anyone do that to a child?
I know Tom knows we don't have to do that.
I know Tom doesn't know why he has to do it alone.
That's not exactly how it happened.
They told me they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think that doing that would be fun.
Tom thinks Mary always packs too much in her suitcase.
I know Tom can do that better than Mary.
My heart is grieving.
Tom has decided he won't stay here.
Tom and Mary agreed to be here at 2:30, but they're not here yet.
Who was this done by?
I knew Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
They claimed they didn't cry.
You know Tom is very unlikely to do that, right?
Tom said he didn't think he had enough time to do that today.
I've done everything I've been asked to do.
I know someone has to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was the first to do that.
I know Tom's a little old-fashioned.

I thought it was hilarious.
Tom works at a store not too far from where he lives.

Tom told me he thought Mary was fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you were planning on doing that?
Tom convinced me you were the best person for the job.

That water isn't cold.
I think Tom stayed in Boston last summer.
How could anyone vote for someone like that is beyond me.
They said they were busy.
I know Tom's in his room packing his suitcase.
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy you that?

"Was anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
Don't pretend you're sorry.

I met someone yesterday who knew Tom.
I know you can't get away with this.
Whenever someone knocks on the door, my dog starts barking.
Both Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do that by yourself.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The bill was hard to calculate.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I've never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom might be ready to do that.
Tom's gonna try to help Mary do that.
It could have been worse.
Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I both didn't go to yesterday's meeting.
How come you didn't come to the party?

They're welfare queens.
Not everyone's ready.
There's gonna be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where will the meeting be held?
I think Tom's incorrect.
Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that.

Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
I'm not sure that both Tom and Mary want to go there.
I don't think it'll take very long to do that for you.
I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
I know you want to help.
Tom and I both stood up at the same time.
They said they didn't have to hurry.
I know you have more important things to think about.
I'm not deaf.
I haven't read all the books.
Tom should never have been laid off.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning on attending today's meeting?

I know Tom used to be good at doing that.
Tom wasn't the one who told Mary she didn't need to do that.
I knew Tom was afraid the police might arrest him.
I suspect Tom didn't visit Australia.
I thought it would take months.
They thought they could do that for me.
It's been years since we last met.
I realize Tom could be done doing that by 2:30.
I didn't have enough money to buy Tom a present.
Tom must have seen something.

Let's make sure we're cowboys.
I don't think I want to go there anymore.
Tom said he hopes you won't eat the last piece of cake.
I think Tom's the one who should do that.
I should have paid in advance.
We're going to the airport.
I doubted that Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
I didn't think anyone else noticed.
That cat is so cute!
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't gonna do that.
I know Tom's a mechanic.
A jack of all trades is a master of none.
I wonder if Tom's pleased.
I know you still want to be with me.
Tom told me he was unemployed.
I didn't know you could understand French.
I doubt you'll be happy with my report.
I should have known Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you made it.
It'll take not less than an hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
You can use my desk if you want.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't stay too long!
I know Tom's popular.
It makes sense.
Tom said he really did it without anyone's help.
I wonder if Tom's ready to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know Tom used to be a speech coach.
He can't swim a mile.
Tom said he probably won't do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom's a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they hope it would happen soon.
Tom said he wasn't used.
I thought I had nothing to lose.
By daybreak the storm was over.
No one I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom's expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of gasoline is so high we can't buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be discreet.
"Thank you." "Why?" "For everything."
You're a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Anything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me they were displeased.
Tom and Mary say they have to do it.
Let's hope that never happens again.
I don't think that actually happened.
Tom said Mary was arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom had trouble admitting he was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a game of chess.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you gonna be okay?
They told me they were starved.
I thought something was seriously wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleepy yet.
Tom assumed that everyone knew Mary was going to do that.
I know Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
Looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll get lost.
They say they like studying French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom will probably do that.
Tom said he was gonna stay up all night.
I didn't know Tom was a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know that you were the one who did that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there's still a lot of stuff left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was glad that that was going to happen.
You're always questioning my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know Tom's not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I don't think Tom should agree to do that.
I don't think Tom has sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should have stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should've told Tom sooner.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning on staying in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pen I can borrow?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It is agonizing for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do anything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What's the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused a lot of damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone's given up.
Let's get our photograph taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'd probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning on doing it tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to be doing this.
I know Tom's doing it well.
Tom said nothing's changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know Tom's afraid he's gonna get fired.
If I were you, I'd call the doctor.
I wasn't feeling very hungry.
I've done everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a tie I can borrow?
I didn't think we'd find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom's not an angel.
I think Tom's crazy.
That sounds great.
Tom's driving over to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he was willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom's still only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I belong here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he might win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know you're not mistaken me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been released out of prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said that Mary thought that John might be required to do it by himself.
I know what I'd do.
He doesn't need to bring the umbrella.
Both Tom and Mary weren't home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I have to do it today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him yesterday afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired I can barely walk.
They felt they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but speak none.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's crushed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have gotten home by himself.
Tom and Mary both know who you are.
Mary said she didn't plan to do it by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were impressed.
Tom hasn't told us what he needs to do yet.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he was expecting Mary to return to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do it again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're being ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he'd have gotten here by now.
Tom and Mary said they'd do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I looked unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to do that.
I thought Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom's pleased.
I'm frying fish.
The wind calmed down at night.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted he killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he won't be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John's actually gonna do that.
They say they also have to do that.
I know Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they'd help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they snore.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he'd found something.
And business is not charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was ever in Australia.
I don't think Tom's as good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought the prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he was hoping he'd be able to do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unafraid.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Tom and I are both angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me whether I liked it or not.
Many old people these days can't keep up with times.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decided to do that.
It's kind of a cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll make it.
Tom denied taking the bribe.
Tom said he thought doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broke.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait till morning?
We'll be landing in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom's unprejudiced.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do it today.
Don't talk business while we eat.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She has to be taken to the hospital.
I'd have helped you if you asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This isn't a drill.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew they might not let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's still wrong.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked the puzzles.
I know Tom's not planning on going to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do it by yourself.
Tom said he thought doing that would be fun.
I think you'll find out it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Are you still planning on doing this with Tom?
Tom said he wasn't feeling safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you'd be there, but I couldn't be there at the time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that's gonna happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me he thought Mary was truthful.
It's quite likely that Tom will come.
I doubt Tom's coming to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone tried that before.
You should've taken better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done it alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could have told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom never does that again.
Tom says he only swears when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he was planning on going on October 20th.
They said they're doing just fine.
Hospitals continued between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I'd have done that if I could.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning on doing that.
Tom assumed everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wished he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that.
I think Tom's the one who should tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that's not the case.
Tom found the watch he lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom's a messy person.
I'm sorry, sir, there must have been some mistake.
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he'd be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts you'll be able to pass the examination.
Where is everyone?
How did you feel?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do it again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one comes.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should've hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do it tomorrow.
I know Tom's a chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he was glad Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that was what you'd want.
I know it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do it anytime soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blond girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom's a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom's a sophomore.
Tom definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom should never have tried to do it alone.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I'd let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do it alone.
I wonder if it'll really be hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said that Mary knew she might not have to do it again.
They swore they wouldn't do it again.
I don't really plan on doing that.
I know Tom's gonna let you do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they wouldn't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't done doing that yet.
They put their notes away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was over thirty.
We went up two floors to reach the armor stalls.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he's going to die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you'd tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the little things.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it was a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought he might have to do it.
Tom said he'd never try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom gave me a lot of things.
I know Tom's a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan on staying at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure exactly what we should be doing.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that tonight.
I don't think I know the man who plays the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary swore they'd never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were scared.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there's still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassed.
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They're living in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you're gonna have much fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
And plan to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was scared.
Tom already told me he's decided to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom's a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they've taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused only minutes before it exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they'd win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we're gonna find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car and neither does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who do you think asked me to give this to you?
I was just sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he'd come if we invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom was gonna leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone's lived in this house for a long time.
Tom denied that he stole the money.
Tom said he hasn't decided what he's gonna do yet.
Everyone knew Tom didn't like going to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom's obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that won't happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom should have been here.
Tom and Mary said they had fully recovered.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do it by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There's no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were ticklish.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I'd be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, what's the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He'll have to do that again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh veg is sold here.
I believe this is not a good idea.
Tom's already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's irritated.
I haven't met anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I both don't speak French.
I thought you'd be ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was glad that that happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom's in Boston.
Tom denied he met Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in mid-Europe and consists of nine Bundesländers.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not thirty yet.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do it by herself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thiner than the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's gonna do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary's gonna be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend Tom's normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried to do it alone.
Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm taller than he is.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom set down his glass.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this town.
That's a good question.
Without water, we can't exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary said they didn't agree to do that.
I know Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can someone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do it alone.
Tom has a lot to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There's no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was drunk.
I hope I've given you enough money to buy everything you need.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they didn't have any money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should never have gotten that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his one and only.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're great.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.
I don't think Tom wins very often when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary was unable to speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do it alone.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do it by herself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unafraid.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary probably wouldn't do that.
I thought you said we weren't gonna do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous about doing that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We can't make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they shouldn't park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he'd done it.
Tom's not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do it today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he'd try something he'd never done before.
I don't think Tom's strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he'd kissed Mary good night.
If you do that, I will.
I think Tom is irreplaceable.
They told me they were tempted to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
What book did you give Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they're hoping they can do that.
I know Tom expected me to do that.
I wonder if Tom's ever been to Boston.
It's not quite finished.
Tom said he felt frustrated.
I know Tom's gonna do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was taller than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Will you lend me your dictionary?
I buy things I know I won't use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do it yesterday.
Tom told me he's not gonna do that.
I know Tom is much stronger than I am.
It wasn't an easy decision.
I wonder if I'm still able to do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anyone anything.
It's Tom's thirtyth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really did what John said she did.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They were hoping they could win.
Tom said he was glad Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I don't think you should have bought that car.
Tom told Mary that he was unwilling to do that.
I should have known Tom would be busy.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone yelling.
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do it.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
No one asked for your help.
I thought Tom did it yesterday.
Tom wasn't allowed to board the plane because he didn't hold a valid travel document.
Something's wrong.
Tom believes Mary's trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't seem too angry.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't through doing that yet.
I don't think Tom's gonna be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by an honor code.
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary was here before.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
I don't think I bought everything I needed.
Tom said he had nothing to do.
I should have noticed it before.
I thought Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained for three days straight.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was the first time Tom did that?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that?
We told everyone we were moving to Australia.
Please do it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom's married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary would be alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was cremated.
Tom said he thought Mary had already finished doing that.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom's still in love with his ex-wife.
I know Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do it.
Tom is very rarely waiting for anyone.
I just assumed everyone was going to do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried to do it alone.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me I needed to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know Tom didn't want to do it alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do it alone.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom's probably going to have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would have talked to Tom instead of just ignoring him.
I thought you'd like to meet my family.
I don't think Tom's going to be disobeyed.
Tom said he was going to do it every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
We're in school together.
I'd like you to look over these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they'd be going by train.
I didn't know Tom didn't really want to do it by himself.
Tom said he was going to ask Mary to leave.
Tom and Mary are going out for a walk after lunch.
I know Tom's grouchy.
Tom's fainted.
Doing that would be hard.
Tom said he didn't know anything about Mary.
I thought Tom lived in Australia.
I'm very surprised Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom doesn't think you're gonna be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he'd be arrested.
I don't think Tom's available.
I don't think Tom's doing that.
I wonder if Tom's interested.
I don't think Tom liked the song you wrote about him.
I think I'll take this tie.
Tom thought he might not be required to do it by himself.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary's never done that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said Mary knew John might want to do it by himself.
The wood has become saturated with water.
I don't think Tom understands.
They said they were handcuffed.
Tom can do that, but Mary can't.
I don't think it's a problem anymore.
Tom told me he thinks he'll do it tomorrow.
I thought it would clear up this afternoon.
Tom told me he was hoping Mary would be done doing that by 2:30.
I'm an insomnia.
Tom said he'd ask Mary if she wanted to do that.
I know that doesn't matter.
Tom says Mary's trustworthy.
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic.
I know I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway.
I think Tom is the one who painted this fence.
Tom must have thought Mary could speak French.
He's a very affectionate father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it's gonna rain tomorrow.
I didn't know Tom owned a gun.
I thought there was a good chance Tom would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bike.
I wonder if Tom knows who left this package on my desk.
Tom should have been found guilty.
It's not working yet.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be angry.
You're not really planning on helping Tom, are you?
Tom, it's not necessary to apologize.
I'm already late.
Tom knows he's got a problem.
I became a doctor so I could help people.
You can't buy happiness.
You promised you'd do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be absent.
It won't be as hard to do as you think it will be.
Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't like him.
Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't realize we wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought you'd probably do that.
Tom said that Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
Tom said he did it for Mary.
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary's not sure if John wants to do that or not.
I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't faster at doing that than I do.
Tom said he was glad you were back.
Tom said he thought Mary was unlikely to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceited.
The way you plan to do that is dangerous.
You should have come sooner.
I think Tom's strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I seriously doubt Tom will be there.
Tom said he's really glad he moved to Australia.
I know Tom's a forest ranger.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they'd only talk to you.
French is her mother tongue.
I don't think Tom should do it alone.
Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do it again.
They know they should do it today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a tie to the party.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was likely to still be pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know Tom hasn't asked Mary to do that yet.
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented.
I don't think doing that is a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom might not do what he's supposed to do.
Tom said Mary didn't want to go to the concert.
Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said he's driving to Boston on Monday.
They told me they were sleepy.
I know you and Tom will do that together.
I think this is the first time Tom's ever done that.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished.
I know Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at the time.
I don't think I'm gonna like being here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have gone camping with you if you'd let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he'd asked her not to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says Mary lies a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think Tom's probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're pulling my leg.
I thought you said you'd never try to do it alone.
I don't think we're gonna do it alone.
I know Tom will be the last one to do that.
Tom said he'd give a book to Mary.
I know Tom didn't know why I was planning on doing that.
Tom didn't know I was Mary's cousin.
They said they didn't know any French.
I thought you might quit.
I had no idea Tom was planning to tell Mary not to do that.
I thought you wanted to be a dancer.
I don't think I'd be a very good company.
Tom says the party's over.
It looks like it's going to rain.
Tom said I might not want to do it alone.
Security is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed that Tom told you that I would be here.
Did you know I was gonna get arrested?
She's a despicable human being.
Tom already intends to do that.
Take off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom's gonna have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom's almost as tall as you.
The first time I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom never did that.
I thought we could help.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I'd like to stay longer.
Tom plans to do that today.
You're the same age I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wished he'd given Mary flowers.
They said they had alibis.
Tom was able to do what he needed to do.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you'd never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're as good as a driver as you say you are.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that.
They told me they were lonely.
What's the time now?
Tom said things went well.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one else was there.
I'm not surprised Tom doesn't have to do that.
He's not very good at the game of politics.
Tom thought it would be funny to put an egg on Mary's chair.
They said they didn't feel hot.
This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizza.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.
Tom says he doesn't plan to do that.
I thought you said no one was going to be here.
Tom thinks Mary's pushy.
I'm skinned.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said he assumed that Mary would want to do that.
One can't do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It's a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do it.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I'm used to staying up late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do it somewhere else.
No one seemed to want to do that.
Tom said he knew he might not be required to do it by himself.
No one told you about the meeting, did they?
I'm aware this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom should have been here by now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't be doing that here.
I know Tom was going to do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason not to do that.
Mary told me she thought Tom was handsome.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they wouldn't mind doing that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do it outside.
I wonder if I should do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary know something's going on.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me he thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me he thought Mary left.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that.
I know Tom knows that Mary rarely does that anymore.
You're braver than me.
Tom said he was getting drowsy.
They said they tried to do it once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary said.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you'd told me earlier, I'd have dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you were gonna be late.
Tom's delirious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.
If I'd known how to do it, I'd have done it myself.
Tom fixed his bike.
You're not really planning on taking pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than me.
Tom and Mary told me they were frustrated.
I didn't know Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you said you saw people do that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary might help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
Everyone except Tom seemed to be having fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised Mary did that.
I knew Tom was done doing that.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still in school.
I knew Tom would be the next one to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't do that.
They say they'll buy that for you.
They say they don't need money.
Tom's unwilling to go alone.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everyone agrees it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put his clothes on.
I don't think Tom's planning on helping us.
They say they're feeling better now.
I assume you're going to the dance with Tom.
Tom thought I might be required to do it by myself.
I don't think that's anyone I know.
I don't think Tom did what you said he did.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think it's gonna be hard for Tom to do that.
Tom said he doesn't know where Mary wants to go.
Tom and Mary both lived in Australia when they were kids.
Tom really thought we didn't have to do that.
It's not good for anyone.
Tom said he often thinks about leaving.
Does Tom and Mary know you don't like them?
I know I've been very stupid.
Tom and Mary are both full-time students.
I know Tom and only Tom have to do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today.
I suspect Tom and Mary don't like me very much.
I wonder if I can do that.
Tom really thought we wanted to do that.
I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's the love of my life.
I think Tom's a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's making for dinner.
It wasn't that hard to find a pair of shoes that fit.
I would never let Tom do that.
I promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than me.
Tom said he had a hard day.
Do you feel like going swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I could do that.
It's your fault.
I thought you said your car was stolen.
I didn't know Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't do that, I won't either.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer.
In his heart, Tom knew he would never return.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom's wasting his time.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I was convinced I shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary's probably still nervous.
If this is madness, there's a method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone they were upset.
Tom said he wouldn't do that unless I helped him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was honest.
She knows about things like that.
I don't think I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking.
I suspect Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's the name of your pharmacy?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that until October.
What's on your mind, Tom?
Tom's a traveling salesman.
I suspect Tom's not in Boston anymore.
Tom's convinced he needs to do that.
This is the first time I've visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that.
Everyone knows we killed Tom.
Tom said he'd rather not go to Australia with us.
Dinner's not ready yet.
I hope I can help you tomorrow.
Of course we could do that, but it would be really hard to do.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance Tom's gonna ask Mary to dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom's someone I look up to.
Tom says he's sorry that he broke his promise.
I think I have just enough money to buy the computer that I want.
I realize Tom's going to try to do that.
I'm very glad to see you.
They said they're cold.
I know Tom knows I don't have to do that.
Tom just did what he should have done last week.
Tom says he doesn't usually wear underwear.
I know Tom is a better musician than Mary.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
Tom and Mary said they'd win and they did.
No one knew that but Tom.
Tom thought Mary wasn't cold.
Tom told me he thought Mary still lived in Australia.
I thought Tom would be happy about that.
I know Tom would let you do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't sleeping.
Tom goes to Boston every chance he gets.
I know Tom never considered doing that.
Didn't you know that I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'd call you later.
I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse's blown.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
Tom should've been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to ridicule people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't do that.
They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they're not gonna do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get the fuck out!
I think Tom was in Boston at least once.
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
Tom said Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they don't like studying in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this seat empty?
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom is confident.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may be lying.
I heard Tom lives in Australia.
No one told me I shouldn't park there.
Tom could have taken the money.
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
Make sure no one enters.
I doubt that'll ever change.
Tom told everyone he was bored.
It was clear Tom was going to do that with Mary.
I suspect Tom's drunk.
I met someone yesterday who knew that we did.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I hope I can live here with you.
Those agenda items were taken en block for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about it.
I suspect that Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I have to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.

Tom wasn't given the chance that you and I were given.
How did you know Tom was planning to do that?
Will you give me one pen?
You can stay here as long as you keep quiet.
I have a feeling that I've been here before.

It is not until you get sick that you realize the value of good health.
I thought I'd broken my leg, but a X-ray showed that I didn't.

There's not much we can do to help.

Christmas is just around the corner.
Tom's not very likely to want to do that.
Tom is the smartest person I've ever met.
A man called you last night.
I'm a little drunk.
They're not as hard as they look.
I guess this is a step in the right direction.
I'll make sure Tom does that sometime today.
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her.
I didn't understand anything you said.
You should have left while you had the chance.

That won't change anything.

I know Tom's much smarter than Mary is.
How much did you spend a day when you were in Australia?

I don't think anyone was pleased.
Looks like someone ripped a page out of this book.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who did that.
I don't think Tom has time to talk to you now.
I don't think you should have done that alone.
He's a man who gets things done.
I hope you'll be my friends.
Tom said he wanted to try riding a unicycle.
I figured you might know why Tom left early.

They told me they were hungry.
It'll be done by the time you get here.

I promise you I won't be late.

No one's been hurt yet.
I don't think it's up to us to decide.
You're handsome.
This is the first time I've rided a horse.
They said they like to do that.
Stand back, please.
Tom tried hard to calm everyone down.
We all wondered why she dumped such a nice man.
Those who know me know I can't do that.
The first time I held my girlfriend's hand was on the school bus.
Tom said Mary thought John might want to do it early tomorrow morning.

I don't believe you can speak Hebrew.

What color is it?
I can say please and thank you, but that's where my knowledge of German ends.
Tom thinks some of his friends can do that.
When she came to the place where the path led across the moor, she found small pools of water, and a great deal of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and drove on it, that she might pass without wetting her feet.
Tom thought Mary did it on purpose.
Tom must have been showing off.
Tom was paid more than he expected to be paid.
