Welsh Parliamentary Representatives are worried they'll "look like Muppets"
Some of the parliamentary MPs (Engl. Member of the Assembly, AM) have amazed the proposal that in the future could be called representatives of the Welsh Parliament (Member of the Welsh Parliament, MWP).
This came as a result of plans for the assembly to be renamed to the Welsh Parliament.
Parliamentary representatives from all political spectrums are concerned that they could become a subject of mockery.
A parliamentary representative from the Labour Party said his group is concerned that the name is "rimmed with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: on the Welsh Twp means stupid, a pwp shit.
Parliamentary representative of the Wales Party (Welsh Plaid Cymru) said that the group is "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
Velski conservative said his group was "opened" to change the name, but MWP could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" pronounces a similar expression of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The parliamentary committee, currently preparing the law to introduce the name changes, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the parliamentary legislators will be titled on their own."
In 2017, the Law of the Government of Wales gave the Welsh Assembly authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of public consultations on proposals that have encountered wide support for changing the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of representatives in the assembly, the Committee was inclined to name "welsh Parliament members" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the highest support during public consultation.
Parliamentary representatives are proposing alternative options, but the fight to achieve consensus could bring headaches to President Elin Jones, who are expected to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to how the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of parliamentary representatives and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentary MPs will have a decisive voice on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on country's name change
Voters will vote Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The goal of voting is to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, a province called Macedonia
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the stumbling of the Greek territory and repeatedly opposed the launch of its EU and NATO accession process.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, opponent of plebiscite's name change, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
However, voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in the name is a simple price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells shut while the churches in Harlem fight for survival
"The older people I talked to said that bars and churches could be found in the past on every corner," Mr Adams said.
"No one else is here today."
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are hanging out today in another way," he said.
"The bars no longer represent the living rooms of the neighborhood where people stay regularly."
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the church leaders think and "before or later they will be reunited at the beginning."
He added that churches could replace housing buildings with apartments where people who will not help the rest of the churches in the neighborhood.
"The big majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings will be white people," he said, "There will therefore be a faster day when these churches will be completely closed because it is unlikely that the residents who move into those apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches built white conventions before Harlem became a black metropolitan church in 1870 and St. Martin ten years later.
The original white methodistic convention moved out in the 1930s.
The black congregation held by the goddess nearby took possession of the building.
St. Martin's church took over a black congression with Reverend John Howard Johnson on the forehead and a boycott of merchants on a little in 125th Street, the main street for shopping in Harlem, who opposed hiring or improving black people.
The 1939 fire had severely damaged the building, but since the parishes of Reverend Johnson planned its rebuilding, they ordered a series of bells, so-called caryllon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson and heir in St. Martin, proudly called Caryllon "the bells of poor men".
The expert who played on the caryllon in July used the second term: "Cultural Treasure" and "independable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first caryllon in the world in which black musician Dionisio A. Lind played at a larger carrillon in the Riverside church for 18 years.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complicated story about architects and construction artists, some of which brought laički leaders to the church and other episcopic diescesis.
Skristia, the steering body of the parish made up of laik, wrote the dietary in July because of the concern that the diet would "continue to transfer" costs to the scripture, although the sacristia was not involved in the engagement of architects and contractors of construction sent by the diecesis.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the diet.
A shark hurt a 13-year-old during diving for lobsters in California
According to his official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving after lobster in California on the day of opening the lobster hunting season.
The attack happened something before 7:00 a.m. near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV station in San Diego that he was diving with his friends about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's call for help, and then he drove with the group to the scene of the attack to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was an excitement for the lobster caught, but then he realized he was yelling "He bit me!
He bit me!"
Hammel said that when he got close to the boy, he noticed that his whole key bone was torn apart.
"I was struggling to get everyone out of the water: 'There is a shark in the water!'," Hammel added.
The boy was transported with a helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The rescue team captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark was spotted in that area several weeks ago, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper body.
Authorities closed the beach at 48 hours from the Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas to conduct the investigation and the safety of the buyers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans for entering the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury’s becomes competition for chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing cosmetic pulses in the style of goods houses and hiring specialized sellers.
As part of a large entry into the UK beauty market worth 2.8 ml. GBP, which continues to grow compared to the decline of sales on the market of clothing and home equipment, the larger cosmetic counters will be tested in 11 trades across the country and expand to additional trades next year if they show successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one of the ways in which supermarkets try to use the space on the shelves that were once scheduled for television, microwave ovens and home equipment.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the offer of cosmetic products on 3,000 products, including first trade marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And existing asortiman companies L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will receive more space with areas for certain goods brands similar to trades such as Boots.
Supermarket also restarts its asortiman decorative cosmetics Boutique, so most products will be suitable for vegans, which is what younger customers are looking for.
In addition, the perfume trader Fragrant Shop will be using concessions in two Sainsburys stores, the first one that opened last week in Croydon in southern London and the second that opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Network shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local groceries means that supermarkets must work harder to attract people.
Mike Coupe, Director-General Sainsbury’sa, said that outlets will look more like supermarkets while this chain of supermarkets seeks to resist favourable trades such as Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's introduced in hundreds of shops the outlets of Argos, as well as a large number of Habitats departments because he bought both chains two years ago, he claimed to encourage the sale of livelihood supplies and made these akvisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to refresh its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
In early 2000, Sainsburys entered a joint venture with Boots, but it ended with a quarrel about the division of income from pharmacy in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s three years ago for 125 million GBP sold his pharmaceutical work in 281 Celesi, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds argues that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by putting in four shops an asortiman of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks commercial director Sainsbury’sa said: “We have changed the appearance and impression of our departments with cosmetic products to provide our users a more pleasant environment.
We have also invested in a special training of colleagues who will be at hand to buyers and give them advice.
Our cosmetic brands are designed to match all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for buying cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones "dire" after Holly Willoughby gave up an agreement worth 11 million pounds
Dragon's Den Peter Jones's star left to "cooked out of anger" after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up an agreement worth 11 million pounds with his trade mark to focus on its new contracts with the trade chain Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their trade mark of home clothes and fashion accessories Truly.
Their trade mark is compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show manager This morning, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Dragon's Den Peter Jones's star to cook from anger by withdrawing at the last moment from a common profitable job to focus on her own new great contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources claim that Jones was “bearing” when a golden girl of television during an intense meeting Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to 1.5 million pounds mean that there is no more time to devote themselves to their trade mark of home clothes and fashion accessories, Truly.
This business was compared to a brand of Goop Gwyneth Paltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s greatest priorities.
This was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would ensure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire was all involved in that job.
No one could believe what was going on Tuesday so close to running the whole line.
In the headquarters of the Marlow warehouse is full of goods that are ready to sell."
Experts believe that because of the departure of the head of the show This morning, one of the stars in Britain in which the most costly investment, the company could suffer millions of losses due to large funds invested in products from pillows and candles to clothing, and possible additional delays in the launch of the line.
And that could mean the end of a long time's friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his husband Tara Capp for ten years.
In 2016, Willoughby founded Truly with Capp, and Jones, 55, joined them as CEO in March.
Couples spend their vacations together and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the ambassador of the M&S trademark and will replace Ant McPartlin as the head of the ITV show I’m a celebrity.
The source close to Jones last night said "We don't want to comment on his business activities."
Heavy negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he'd get in the paper for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude toward the leader of North Korea.
"Why did President Trump make so many concessions?"
He said Trump, impersonating the voice of the news manager.
"I have not made any concessions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearisation of North Korea.
But the denuclearisation negotiations are stuck.
More than three months after a meeting in June in Singapore on Saturday, the North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly's world leaders that the north did not notice the "appropriate reaction" of the United States on the activities of disarming North Korea.
He noticed instead that the United States still did not suspend sanctions aimed at further pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech at the meeting.
"We are doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were threatened by a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would get hurt.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results – abortion of rocket launches, assistance in the release of hostages and returning the remaining US soldiers home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It is so easy to act as president, but instead of being ahead of this full arena waiting for 10,000 people to enter, we would have about 200 people there," Trump said, pointing out a bunch of people right in front of us.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the earthquake at Lombok, foreign NGOs were said not necessary.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the use of international aid resources.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear about not seeking international assistance, so all this is a bit problematic," Mrs Sumbung said.
Although the Savi Children's organization is forming a team that will travel to Palace, it is still not certain that foreign staff will be able to work on the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman of the National Disaster Office, said Indonesian officials assess the situation in Palu to see if they will allow international agencies to be involved in efforts to provide assistance.
Given the constant tremor of the soil in Indonesia, the country remains sadly unprepared to wear with anger of nature.
Although shelters in the case of tsunami are built in Aceh, it is not something that is common on other parts of the coastline.
The lack of siren warnings on the tsunami in Palu, even though the warning was in force, it probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time travel between many Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics more difficult.
A ship of hospitals that was installed in Lombok to take care of earthquake victims is on its way to Pala, but it takes at least three days to reach the place of a new disaster.
Improvement of the Indonesian dissolved structure was the basis of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
However, the state administration under Yokoo is struggling with the lack of financial resources and new elections are being held next year.
Yoko also faces the pressure of the remaining sektatic tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim majority members embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed, and dozens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs fight in the streets of machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved on Saturday Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League game against Chelsea with a hit at the Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was approximately 30 meters away from Chelsea naked at a score of 1:0 for Chelsea.
He switched the ball to his left leg before he kicked it towards the opposite statue.
The ball flew high above the naked to the right upper corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaya Arrizabalagai who jumped towards her and entered the net.
"It was demanding to get into that position, get to the ball, and players like Shaq always try to get as close to the naked as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com
"I saw Kante coming, and I only touched the ball once, and I didn't think too much about it, and I just shot."
Chelsea led in half by 1:0 after the hit by the Belgian star Edena Hazard in the 25th minute.
The blue attacker passed the ball back to Mateu Kovačić during that game before he turned somewhere on the half of the field and ran to Liverpool's half.
The coin made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he put a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to naked.
Hazard went around the defense and left-handedly hit the ball into the net on the opposite statue next to Liverpool Alisson Becker's goalie.
Liverpool plays the game of the club competition against Napoli at the League Championship at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea welcomes Videoton to the UEFA European League on Thursday in London.

I would also invite everyone, especially cab drivers, who may have taken something on their car cameras to turn to us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
The police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is the resident of Birkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, there were friends on the scene who thought they knew that woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way, and the police have said that the procedure of informing the nearest relatives of the victim is in progress.
The cab driver who lives on Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but the cops told him no one was allowed to enter the building or get out of it.

The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to be found in the midst of the debate on "the ending of history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for almost Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic puritarian followers.
But Cromwell's society called the attempt by Mr. Crick "stupid" and "trying to override history".
John Goldsmith, the president of Cromwell’s society, said: “In a debate currently being held in connection with the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace became an object of debate.
Iconoclasm of English civil wars is not something Cromwell has ordered or spent.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
The magnificent revival of Cromwell Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of ways of thinking in the 19th century and part of the history of a person that many still consider to be worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella many consider, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to defend Parliament from external pressure.
Is that a completely credible opinion the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has formed the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a distinctive figure that represents one side of that division.
His achievements in the role of Lord Protector are still worthy of honor and marking. "
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer
According to local media, pigs attacked and killed a farmer at the southwest market.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead with sliced artery and covered in blood near the liupanshui market in Guizhou province published the Jutarnji list of southern China on Sunday.
A pig breeder was preparing to vaccinate pigs in the May 30, 2005 in Xiningo in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighbouring province Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the next pig was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, forensic interrogation confirmed that a pig weighed 250 pounds of the breeder to death.
The evening news Guiyanga states that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin’s legs were bloody and crippled."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
Market manager told Večernje news that the pig was locked in order to prevent attacking someone else while the police collect evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market administration are supposed to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although it rarely happens, pig attacks on people have already been recorded.
In 2016, the pig attacked her wife and her wife at their farm in Massachusetts, and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilometre pig clipped a Welsh farmer with a tractor until his wife chased the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "killer".
"They're just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect," he said.
The remains of the hurricane Ross bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As announced, the Rosa hurricane is weakening across the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring flood rain in the northern Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa was blowing at 5:00 A.M. at the eastern time at 140 km/h, which makes the 1st category hurricane, and was 620 km southwest from Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, above the Pacific is created a low pressure area and moves towards the Western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Peninsula of Baja California in the form of a tropical storm, it will start pushing deep layer of tropical moisture towards the north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up 250mm rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low pressure area will cause strong downturns in the large part of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous buying floods, mud ramps and possible slides in the desert.
The deep layer of tropical moisture will cause the production of slopes that will be approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Even 25 to 100 mm rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially above the majority of Arizona.
There are possible buyic floods with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the devastated nature of the tropical rain.
No advice is advised to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical downturns.
The heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dust screwdriver.
Approaching the low pressure area will bring local heavy rain on the shores of Southern California.
Possible demolitions are greater than 12 mm, which can cause less mud and slide roads.
This will be the first drops in the wet season in this region.
The tropical showers will start approaching Arizona on Sunday late evening and Monday early in the morning before the end of Monday's day and cover the wider area on Tuesday.
The heavy rain will spread on Tuesday to the area where the borders of the Allied States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah are touched and last all day on Wednesday.
In October there are major temperature changes across the United States as Arctic cools, but tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes it leads to dramatic temperature changes at small distances.
Sunday is a great example of dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
During the next few days the leftover summer warmth will continue to grow and spread again.
In most Central and Eastern US, it is expected to start warming from 27 degrees from the South Levels to parts of the northeast in October.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high possibility of above average temperatures in the East of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched six TV networks on Thursday a tense testimony of candidates for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly happened in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political calculation continued, and the rapporteurs interrupted the regular program to inform about the reverse at the last moment of Friday: an agreement reached by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, that the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate court board that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take her clothes off at her high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his burning testimony that he was absolutely sure that it didn't happen.
A hearing Friday was probably followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number listed in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no available number of viewers for other networks transmitting the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people looking at the contents of the offices.
To get you this better, it's about a crowd that is a number similar to the one who watches the game of American football or Oscar's assignment.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the study strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had the largest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the whole day's hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.2 million.
The profession remained large after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the play that took place on Friday.
After the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras shot him screaming demonstrators on Friday morning while he was trying to go to the hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood down for a few minutes while he was shot in person in front of CNN's cameras and the demonstrators scattered him with the injuries.
"I stand here in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him: “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office published a statement before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the board hearing.
A few hours later, all the cable and television networks followed live when the Justice Committee was to vote on the introduction of Kavanaugh's nomination to vote the entire Senate.
But Flake said it would only be done provided that the FBI investigates the charges against the candidates in the next week, which the Democrats demanded in the minority.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched a federal investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union to "play politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermine national interest.
The British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived on 29 September 2018 at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham in the United Kingdom.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, in the second interview in the same issue with her on the cover, continued to criticise her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that the United Kingdom and the EU should charge each other customs fees "complete nonsense".
The murder of Wayde Sims: the police arrested Dyteon Simpson as suspected of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect in the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained under the indictment of murder from the inhabitants, according to the Baton Rouge Police Administration.
Officials posted a video of the conflict between Simps and Simpson, and the police said Simms lost his glasses in the conflict.
The police found glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, CBS branch.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
A bail of $350,000 is being requested.
The coroner's office of the Eastern Baton Rouge announced a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of the death was a bullet wound to the head.
The police administration thanks the working group for the fugitives of the state police Louisiana, the criminal lab of the federal state police, the Southern University police and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Sports director of LSU Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for implementing the law for "continuity and searching for truth".
Simms was 20 years old.
A wing player, 183 cm tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for LSU.
On average, he had 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps at the game last season.
Friday morning, the basketball coach of LSU Will Wade said the team was "treasant" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Vulcan casts ashes to Mexico City
The ash expelling the volcano of Popocatapetl reached the southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Centre on Saturday warned the Mexicans not to approach the volcano after enhanced activity in the crater and registered 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The center was following multiple swings and tremors.
Pictures in social media showed thin layers of ash on the windscreen of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophisians have noticed increased volcanic activity located 72 kilometers south of the capital since the 7-1 earthquake in 2017 has shaken central Mexico.
Vulcan known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalon separatist conflict encountered an anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters who advocated independence confronted the intervention police and joined thousands of people with anti-demonstrations to mark a catalonic polarising separation vote.
A group of masked separatists who opposed the intervening police began to shoot cops with eggs and paint in powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would otherwise be flooded by tourists.
The fights broke out later during the day the police used the bats to calm down the fight.
During several hours, groups who advocate independence scanned "No forgettings, no forgiveness", and against them unionists shouted " Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to the hospital due to lighter injuries gained during the demonstration, local press reported.
Anxiety in the region that seeks independence has not steadied a year after the referendum of October 1st, which Madrid declared illegal and which the Catalonites celebrated.
The majority of voters have decided on independence even though the turnout was small because those who oppose separation have mainly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalon authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in severe conflicts last year after the police tried to stop voting in voting places across the region.
Groups advocating independence spent on Friday night on the street to prevent demonstrations from supporting national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the demonstrators were forced to take another route.
Narciss Termes, 68, an electrician who attended demonstrations of separatists along with his wife, said he no longer hopes that Catalonia will gain independence.
"We've had one of the best moments last year.
I watched my parents cry with happiness that they could vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite their achievement of key, although a close victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalon independence parties are difficult to maintain momentum this year because their most famous leaders are in self-intended exile or in detention waiting for a trial for their role in organising a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed demonstrations on his phone in support of the police, said the conflict was prompted by politicians of both sides.
"The situation is getting tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine catalon leaders who announced to the investigative prison since the end of last year that he would run for European Parliament's elections next year.
"The run for European elections is the best way to announce the regression of democratic values and repression we have experienced by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Arrested men after driving a car into the house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after they stumbled in a house in Londonderry more than once.
The incident occurred Thursday around 19.30 BST in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point the car was fired by an arrow from the crossbow.
Bingo Menge brought Livingstone's victory over the Rangers with score 1:0
The first goal of Dolly Menge for Livingston brought victory
The new club of the Scottish League Premiership Livingston surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second defeat from the eighteen matches at the head of the Ibrox stadium club.
The hit by Dolly Menge turned out to be decisive as Gary Holt's team in a second matched with the Iberian.
Gerrard's team is still without winning the guests at the Premiership this season, and next Saturdays they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league, behind eight points.
Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna club as part of the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, increased his six-game victories, and Chief Coach Holt has still not experienced defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead before they reached that hit, considering their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on his way to naked, and then Alan Lithgow could only point the ball widely after he slipped to intercept Craig Halkett's head to naked.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause difficulties to the guests
And that's exactly how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free blow, and Livingston designed the opening, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson together assisted Menga who hit in the middle of naked.
By that moment, the Rangers had mostly control over the ball, but they faced an invulnerable domestic defense, so the goaler Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
That continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the blow.
The legs of the naked Rangers Allan McGregora stood in the way of Scott Pitttman, and Lithgow put a wide blow from another organized attack on Livingston.
The long addition failed to cross the Livingston goal line, and two eleven men were not judged – after Halkett's conflict with Deputy player Glen Middleton and one to play hand.
"Great" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdar Lamont from Scottish BBC in Arena Tony Macarononi
Excellent game and results of Livingston.
All of them were excellent, and they continued to overcome expectations on that entry path.
Their style of game and staff have barely changed since their return among large clubs, but the great credit goes to Holt and the way he united the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great at the head of an excellent organised defense, and Menga didn't allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a breath.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards that set up a good game under Gerrard.
They just once opened a hole in the home team, and that's their kind of call to squeeze for the Rangers in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomes mixed feelings in Koeln
On Saturday (September 29th), everything was a lot of smiles under clear sky when the leader of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany -- aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They dispersed in view of issues that include human rights, freedom of press and accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Koeln to open a huge new mosque.
Turkey's largest population outside Turkey lives in the city.
For security reasons, police blocked the 25,000-man mass gathering outside the mosque, but a number of presidential supporters who came to see him appeared nearby.
Hundreds of protesters from Erdogan -- many Kurds -- raised their voice by judging Erdogan's policy and the German government's decision to welcome him with the welcome to the country.
Conflicted demonstrations reflect the divide caused by a visitor by some German Turks celebrating as a hero, while others attack as an autocracy.
A road crash in Deptford: a cyclist died in a car crash
The bicyclist died in a car crash in London.
The crash took place near the Bestwood and Evelyn Street crossing, on the road with a thick traffic in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and an ambulance arrived, but a man died on the spot.
The crash took place several months after another bicycle was killed after the crash and the escape of a driver from the scene at the Chiders Street, about a mile away from the Saturday crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify a man and inform his closest relatives.
Due to the accident, roads have been closed and bus traffic has been redirected, and motor vehicles are recommended to avoid that area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six police officers injured in riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a man's prison of a guy.
The riots broke out in Long Martin prison at Worcestershire about 9:30 BST on Sunday and still last.
Special "Tornado" units have been brought to tackle the riots that include eight prisoners and are limited to one wing.
Police officers on the scene were assisted due to minor facial injuries.
Prison service spokesman said: "A specially trained prison staff has been engaging to resolve an incident in the prison of Long Lartin.
Six staff members received help for the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we clearly want to make clear that all responsible will be committed to the police and could spend longer behind bars."
Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was announced that the prison manager ended up in the hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, the intervening police were invited to prison to resolve a serious situation in which the staff was attacked by pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with buich floods (possible benefits for dry areas)
It is rare that tropical depression hits Arizona, but it is likely that this will happen at the beginning of the next week when the Rosa Hurricane crosses the desert southwest with its remaining power and brings the danger of stormy floods.
The National Hydrometeorological Service has already issued warnings on buicular floods for Monday and Tuesday in the area of Western Arizona, across South and Eastern Nevada, Southern California and Utaha, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should get close to Phoenix late Monday with the rain and cross right over it on Tuesday.
The Phoenix National Hydrometeorological Service stated in its tweet that “from 1950, only ten tropical cycles have brought a tropical storm or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina, 1967, passed 40 miles from the Arizona border."
The latest model of the National Hurricane Centre envisions 50 to 100 mm insulated quantities up to 150 mm on the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest including the Rocky and the Great pool there is a probability of 25 to 50 mm, with a possible isolated total amount up to 100 mm.
For those outside the dangers of stormy floods, Rosa could come as a salvation because the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a great danger, some of these rainfalls could be useful because in the southwest, there is currently a drought.
"By the US map of dried areas, little more than 40 per cent of Arizona was affected by at least an extreme drought, the second highest category," weather announced.com
The path of the hurricane first approached the coast along the Mexican Peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 130 km an hour and was 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km an hour.
The storm encountered colder waters of the Pacific and therefore weakened.
It is therefore expected to approach the coast of Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening by the power of the tropical storm.
The rain in parts of Mexico could be strong and poses a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of total slopes expected in the area from the Peninsula of Baja California to Northwest Sonore is from 75 to 150 mm, possible maximum 250 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass over Arizona and South Utah by Tuesday late evening.
"The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remains is very strong rains in the Peninsula of Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora and the US desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Centre said.
These rains are expected to cause the life of dangerous stormy floods and fleas of mud in the deserts and slides in the mountain field.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old found in Somerset with stab wounds.
About 04.00 BST on Saturday in Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton was found a wounded teenager.
He was driven to the hospital and in stable condition.
Avon and Summerset's police administration said a 17-year-old, 2 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Police officers have called to report to everyone who has a recording of the event.
Trump claims Kavanaugh suffers malice and rage of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cruel and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at the Wheeling campaign in West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "treated malice and anger" by the Democratic Party during the nomination procedure.
On Thursday, Kavanauh testified in front of Congress and determinedly and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford's charges for sexual assault ten years ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing on the charges she filed.
The president said on Saturday that day "the American people saw brilliantness, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"The vote to affirm Judge Kavanaugh is to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with an impeccable career in public service," he said to gathered supporters in Western Virginia.
The president touched Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of the Republican elections in half of the presidential mandate.
"Five weeks share us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but actually I am," he said.
That's why I fight everywhere for great candidates."
Trump claimed the Democratic mission was to "make resistance and obstruction".
The Republican leader's assistant told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected at the latest Friday.
Hundreds of death in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number continues to grow
The authorities said on Saturday that at least 384 people died, many of them drew huge waves that hit the coast when the big earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulawesi Idonezian island.
Hundreds of people gathered at the beach festival in Pala on Friday when waves up to six meters hit the shore, dragging many of them to death and tearing everyone down on their way.
Tsunami followed the earthquake of magnitude 7,5.
"When the danger of tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn't run immediately and died," said Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman of the Indonesian agency for mitigation the consequences of BNPB disaster at a press conference in Jakarta.
"Cunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, debla, houses, hit everyone on land," Nugroho said, adding that tsunami crossed an open sea at 800km an hour before he hit the coast.
"Some people climbed trees to escape from tsunami and survived," he said.
About 16.700 people were evacuated at 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the catastrophe agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and demolished bridges and the mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent strikes continued to shake that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could have felt in the area in which 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) announced in its statement that the energy freed by a huge earthquake Friday corresponded to the two hundred-fold force of an atomic bomb threw at Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical position of the city located at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the power of tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were demolished.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of victims and damages may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in a area called Dongala and nearing the earthquake epicenter.
" Communications have been completely disconnected and we have no information from Dongal."
"In the area more than 300,000 people live," the Red Cross statement added to and that staff and volunteers have been headed to affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get a lot worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Pala, although officials argue that the waves came at the moment the warning was issued.
In an amateur video that is distributed on social networks, a man on the top floor of the building is panicked to warn people down on the street about the coming tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the water wall collapsed on the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
The Reuters agency could not confirm the authenticity of the recording immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused electricity to break communications around Palu, which has made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue actions.
According to the authorities, she started sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city airport has been reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Saturday.
Tsunami in Indonesia took over 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
"If the staff of the World Vision organization from Donggala successfully arrived in the city of Pala, where employees were taken into the Tarpaulin tents set in the backyard of their offices, they forwarded the scenes of destruction on the road," Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many ruined houses," he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
While humanitarian groups launched aid wheels in catastrophe, some argued that foreign humanitarians with great expertise were disabled to arrive in Pala.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries may only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, spokesman of the Indonetic Red Cross.
"After the government says "All right, it is a national disaster" we can receive international assistance, but such a situation is not yet declared."
When the second night of earthquake and tsunami fell in Pala on Friday, friends and families of those who were still considered missing were still hoping their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate the black scenarios of natural disasters.
Saturday, the boy was saved from the sewer.
On Saturday, the saviors freed a woman who was trapped two days in the ruins next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian state paraglyder team, trained two missing paraglycers for Asian games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandagi, were his students.
"In view of many years spent in paraglyding, I carry my own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel, which was expanded to the paraglajder community, he desperately sent whatsApp messages to competitors from Paluo who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with gray leather, rather than with two blue crochets.
"I think that means that the messages are not delivered," he said.
The thieves took 26.750 US dollars during charging the ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole 26.750 dollars on Friday morning from a Brink employee who filled a bankomat in the center of Newport on the Levee, according to a press release for the Newport Police Department.
In a statement from Detective Dennis McCarthy, the car driver was emptying the bankomat in the fun complex and preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy, another man "in the race came to Brink's employee behind his back" and stole the bag with the money to be put into the bankomat.
Witnesses have noticed more suspects fleeing the place of theft, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Everyone who has any information about their identity should contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Raper changes the name to Ye
Raper Kanye West will change the name to Ye.
On Saturday's publication on Twitter, which announced that change, he wrote: "The living will be officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has a nickname Ye for a while and used it as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change comes before his guestship in the Saturday Night Live show in which it is expected to launch its new album Yandhi.
The authors of the show said he replaced a singer Ariana Grande who canceled for "emotional reasons".
Except that it is a shortcut of his current artistic name, West said before that this word has religious meaning for him.
“ I think “ye” is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible, it means “you”, West said earlier this year in a conversation on the title of his album with the radio leader Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am me, it is us.
It started from Kanya, which means “the only one” in Ye – it is a reflection of good, bad, confused, all in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are."
He's one in a series of famous rapists who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
And the former West associate, JAY-Z, was messing with the versions of his name without a line, and with a sketch, and written with great letters.
Mexican AMLO promised not to use an army against citizens
A candidate for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised that he would never use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on the Tlatelolco Square on Saturday to "never use an army against the Mexican people".
Military troops fired during peaceful demonstrations on that square on 2 October 1968 and killed 300 people at the moment the left-hand student movements began to spread in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly support to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education are attracted to young criminal gangs.
The United States should double the investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
"Because China is becoming more active in the area of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount that invests in research in the area," the investor in artificial intelligence and an expert in the Kai Fu Lee region who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the US government announced plans on artificial intelligence, although the US in principle lacks a formal strategy on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the first country in the number of AI innovations by 2030.
"A double increase in the research budget in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start since all other countries are far behind the United States and we are looking for the next major discovery in the area of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
"A double investment increase could double the odds that the next major achievement in the area of artificial intelligence will come to the US," Lee said in a CNBC talk this week.
Lee, whose book was published: “Al Velsile: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order” this month, published by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures that invests in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 80s of the last century, Carnegie Mellon worked at the Carnegie Mellon University, working on the AI system that beat the best American player of the Othello game, and later he was director at Microsoft Research Department and President of the Google Chinese branch.
Lee commended the previous technological competitions of the US government, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked the question when to take place next to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies hired the brightest minds from the university to work on research of artificial intelligence over the past years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that artificial intelligence doctors should automatically offer green cards," he said.
The Chinese State Council published the Plan for the development of the artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
"Chinese National Foundation for Natural Science provides financial resources to persons in academic institutions like the National Foundation for Science and Other State Organisations provide financial resources to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China," Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Intelligence Centre, which aims to include partners from the activity and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a 2 billion-dollar investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, he currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, the US legislation that has wanted to set up the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum Saturday on whether they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of Northern Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has lasted decades and has blocked the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece argues that the name of its northern neighbour represents the stumbling of its territory and has invested a veto on the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
Two governments agreed in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Macedonian Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the vote boycotting campaign has cast doubts about whether turnout will meet the minimum 50 per cent needed to make the referendum valid.
The issue on the referendum voter's ballot said, "Are you for NATO and EU membership with an agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price worth paying to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia, would allow access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that they could live freely under the cover of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," Oliver Georgievska (79) said in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally obligatory, Parliament members said enough that they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said that irregularities have not been reported until 13 hours.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško, joined a referendum on the country's name change on 30 September 2018, which would open the way to join NATO alliance and the European Union.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje, and saw chairs in front of the tents set by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join elevated heads, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to receive us under the name Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asiaian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring so much needed investment to Macedonia, a country where unemployment exceeds 20 per cent.
"I believe that the majority will support the referendum, since more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said the "positive" result would be "affirmation of our future".
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters will join the referendum, below the required response.
The second poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telema TV, showed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70% said they would support the referendum.
To make the referendum a success, the turnout must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious impact of the pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton to achieve a hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling at the Etimad stadium in Manchester, England, they breached Brighton's defense and won for Manchester City with a score of 2 : 0.
Aguero made the victory crazy simple, reaching a hit in 65 minutes.
The Argentinian attacker received adding in the middle of the field at the beginning of the attack.
He broke through three Brighton's defense players and then came into the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposing players in green shirts.
He went by one defender, and then overtaked a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
That's when he added the ball left to Sterling.
The English assailant from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguer who put the right-hand digging ball into the right side of the network and defeated Brighton's doorman Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some difficulty with his foot," reporters reported Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola.
"We planned to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that point."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the understanding of the Prime Minister League.
That hit was reached in 29 minutes.
Aguero got deep on Brighton's ground during that game.
He added a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane along the left flank.
Sane pushed the ball a few times before bringing Sterling to the stave.
Sky Blues attacker put the ball into the net before sliding into the car.
Manchester City fights Hoffenheim in the group game League Championship on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rhein-Neckar-Aren stadium in German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to disable Rockies' advancement
Since nationals players were eliminated from playoff, there was not too much reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes Sunday's victory against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West, get in play.
On Friday night the Rockies won 5 : 2 over the Nationals at least secured a place in the wild card dance, but they hope to win their first title.
"Even though we play for nothing, we can at least throw away knowing what the atmosphere is here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level that I would witness this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals still have to publish a Sunday starter, but they're supposed to offer Scherzer a game in that case.
Scherzer, who will make its 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher space on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
The right-wing from Washington this season scored from 18 : 7, the average of win-win runs (ERA) of 2,53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds change.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
During his speech on the importance of the turnout of the Republican voters to the general election, the president commented on his selection of Brett Kavanaugh as Judge of the Supreme Court.
"All we have done will be tested in November.
It's five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are one of the big, big -- I didn't run, but I'm actually in the race, and that's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
Their intention is to retake power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control; so they want power and control; we will not give them."
Democrats, he says, have a mission "resistant and distracted".
"You have seen this over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angered, evil, corrupt and lying".
He named the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein from the Senate Justice Committee by name, which caused a loud resentment of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the press?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document -- it was really a bad body speech, the worst body speech I've ever seen."
The Labourist Party no longer respects different opinions.
Do not tolerate personal attitudes
It didn't surprise me too much when the activists of the Momentum in my local party voted to censor me.
After all, I am the last in a series of representatives of the Labour Party who are told they are not welcome – and all because we have told us what is in mind.
According to my representative, Joan Ryan was acting similarly because she resisted antisemitism.
I was criticized in the censorship proposal for not agreeing with Jeremy Corby.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironicly similar to themes Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
At a briefing on the Labour Party's Labour Party meeting Friday, Nottingham said that "we want meetings to be included and productive".
Most of the eight years during which I worked as a local representative of the Laburist Party, meetings of the General Council on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings flow in a different tone, and the promise of “kind, gentle ” politics has long been forgotten, if his fulfillment has ever even begun.
It has become more obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, since the associates I thought we shared similar political opinions from me started demanding a drastic change of opinion and taking positions that I would normally never agree with -- whether it was about the national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public – and it is not really important what I say – there are a bunch of insulting words on social networks that call for my revocation, which deny the centre policy and tell me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know that I've had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that have been made to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionality and determination of colleagues who face the lavin of sexist or racist comments daily, but never fail.
One of the aspects of this political era that disappointed me most is tolerating an insulting speech.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should encourage culture of tolerance.
The reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with every proposal for untrust or change of electoral rules, we become an increasingly harsh party.
Many times in the last two years, they advised me to lay my head down, not to be so loud and told me everything would be all right."
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since 32 years ago as a student joined the Labour Party, motivated by neglecting the government of Margaret Thatcher who left my school multi-purpose class to fail, I wanted to provide better public services for those who need them most – either as local councilor or minister in the government.
I've never been hiding my own policy, not even in the last elections.
No one at the Nottingham East branch could have been misled about my political positions and the areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I'd like to say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment when the country grabs towards Brexit that will reflect negatively on households, companies and public services, I don't understand the desire for time and energy to lose my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my electoral units, whether it is members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of revocation or political benefit will distract me from doing what I think is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 Undefeated Ayr heads to the top
Two late attempts may have somewhat affected the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day at Tennent's Prime Ministership League.
Now they've reached the top of the ladder and the only ones are undefeated by ten teams.
Finally, the top defense and better exploitation of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested at every game so far and we are still undefeated, so I must be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie at the Melrose Club said: “Available to Ayra, they took advantage of opportunities better than us. ”
The attempt of Grant Anderson at the 14th minute that was realized by Frazier Climo led Ayr, but the yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was ruled out by Warriors, enabled Melrose to raise results, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the leadership of Ayr with an eleven before, at the very half time, he achieved a hit and realised an independent attempt to change the result for Ayr at 17: 5 at the time of the break.
But Melrose began the second half of the time well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, who realized Baggot, reduced the advantage to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, which they took on the carriers, and when the game continued, Ayr continued a good game by trying Stafford McDowall to realise Climo.
Captain Ayra Blair MacPherson then got a yellow chart and Melrose again forced an extra player to pay, and it was an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The lateral player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow carton for crashing Clim who had no ball; from the line for a felony, MacPherson performed a layout behind Ayro in a full swing of invasion.
Climo realised how he did it almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe received a high blow from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the home team.

Ford Kiernan, the Still Game Series star, seems ready to continue working in service activities after it was discovered that he was appointed director of the company licensed restaurants.
56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the favorite BBC series whose screenwriter and one of the stars, along with a long-standing comedian partner, Greg Hemphill.

"The sea is ours": Bolivia, who has no exit to the sea, hopes that the court will grant her a way out to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the sea center full of elevators in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean has been reported on public buildings.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazona are oried: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to return it."
During the entire Bolivia, which has no exit to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in behalf of Chile during the 19th century resources conflicts is still alive – just like the longing for the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling expected on October 1st, after a five-year procedure, and hopes may be at the highest level in the last few decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, optimisticly awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a bolivian diplomat.
The crowd of Bolivians across the country will look at the International Court of Justice's verdict on large screens and hope that the Hague court will decide in favour of Bolivia's view that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is due to negotiate the accession of a sovereign exit to the sea of Bolivia.
Here's Morales, a Bolivian charismatic autochtonic president who faces a controversial battle to be reelected next year, can also benefit from a verdict on Monday.
"We are adjacent to the return of the Pacific," he pledged at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court would rule in favour of Bolivia and that a little change would change if it were.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to award Chilean territory and said it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The conviction of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final hearings, means the case "was not complex," said Paz Zarate, a Chilean international law expert.
Instead of promoting the interests of Bolivia, the last four years may have turned them back.
"The question of access to the sea has adopted the current bolivian leadership," Zárate said.
Morales' fighting rhetoric buried every goodwill of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court has made the decision uncommonly quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia a "now opportunity to start a new period in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the favorite presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political rat.
"Bolivia will never give up the rights to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to cope with the past."
North Korea said there would be no nuclear disarmment if she couldn't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be nuclearly disarmed if he couldn't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep promises of the day during the meeting of leaders of these two opposing countries in Singapore.
Commenters pointed out at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be willing to restart diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, which comes more than three months after a singapur meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says sanctions continued because of "letting fantasies" and that the opposition of the United States of Declaration on the end of the Korean War would certainly not throw the North on their knees.
Washington is not willing to support the declaration without Pjongjang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want to hold a second summit at the top.
However, there is widely skepticism about the serious intention of Pyongyang to give up the arsenals that the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare for the second meeting of Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion magazines reveal that the last line of big covers for the head on the way to luxury trade in your neighborhood
Whether you want to improve your hat collection or completely cover the sun, don't look further.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the fashion runway presented a line of freaked huge covers for their spring and summer collection in 2019 and enthusiastic style fans at the Paris Week of fashion.
Extremely impractical hats have been erased this summer by Instagram, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention to the runway.
The example that was highlighted was Valentino’s design, and it was a large beige hat decorated with a wide-scale surface of feathers that had completely “taken” the heads of the model.
Other glowing supplements included peppers decorated by jewelry, magical hat, or even a pineapple, but these supplements were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than pieces of high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving suit with a breather and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion expression – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come into luxurious shops in your neighborhood.
The enormous hats fit perfectly with the heels "La Bomba", a fractured hat with a blast of approximately 60 cm wide, which has been seen on many famous and famous persons, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cultural trademark that stands behind an extremely unpractical hat that conquered social networks on the fashion track sent another large creation – a slammed beach bag almost as large as the model in the bathing costume that wore it.
Ingasito orange rafi bag, decorated with raphia and white leather lunch, was an exhibit in the summer collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Week of fashion.
The stylelist of famous and famous, Luke Armitage, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and bags for the beach in luxury stores for the next summer. Since the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large fashion supplements.”
John Edward: language skills the citizens of the world need
Scotland Independent Schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another package of exams of extraordinary results and additional weight giving individual and joint success in sport, art, music and other activities in the community.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, this school representing the Scotland Independent Schools Council (SCIS) is trying to provide the best service level for their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, the career they want to make and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement that school couriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be the favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language who understands, it goes to his head.
"If you speak to him in your mother's tongue, it goes into his heart."
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot only use English if we want to build trust and relations with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages were made by independent school students.
A total of 68% of students who taught foreign languages received excellent grades.
The data collected in 74 SCIS schools shows that 72% of students received an excellent rating for mandarin, while 72% of students who learn German, 69% of students who learn French and 63% of the students who learn Spanish also received the highest possible assessment.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young ones will certainly need in the future.
Today languages are considered as electoral objects as important as the STEM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the couriculum of independent schools, as well as elsewhere.
The survey carried out by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that 17 % of employers cannot fill their jobs due to the lack of workforce with language skills.
Consequently, language skills are increasingly imperative to prepare young people for careers.
Since more jobs require language knowledge, and skills are key in the globalized world.
Regardless of the choice of career, people who have learned to speak foreign language in the future will feel the advantages of such long-term skills.
A person who speaks more languages can directly communicate with foreigners, and that gives her advantage in relation to competition.
According to the YouGov survey in 2013, more than 4000 adults participated, 75% of respondents in the United Kingdom do not know foreign language well enough to communicate on it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of subjects, in particular 15%.
Consequently, investing in learning language is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially the languages of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland every school offers different languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their program, while others will decide languages that are considered to be most important in the United Kingdom 2020, for example mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests, in independent schools they will always have a variety of choices, as well as a teaching staff that is professional in that area.
Scotland Independent Schools enable children to have an environment in which learning will prepare and arm the skills needed for success, regardless of what the future is preparing for us.
It cannot be ignored by the fact that today's global business knowledge of languages is very important for the future of each country so that this must also be reflected on education.
So knowing modern languages should indeed be viewed as “an international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer language selection, diversity and excellentness to young Scots.
Il faut bien only faire.

LeBron will be the first time to play in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans will soon meet LeBron James's first performance for Lakers from Los Angeles.
The Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play the first presidential game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it still doesn't know how many minutes it will take.
"More than one and less than 48 minutes," Walton said on the official Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell posted a tweet that James probably won't play the whole game.
After training early this week, James answered questions about his plans for the Lakers presidential session, which consists of six games.
"In this stage of my career, I really don't need the presidential matches," he said.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a campaign with a number of events tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned gatherings Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet voted for the new Judge of the Supreme Court and plans to boost support for the upcoming elections because there is a risk that the Republicans will lose most in Congress after the November vote.
What time does tonight's Trump meeting in West Virginia begin, and how can you look at it on the net?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia was scheduled for 19 hours in Eastern Time, tonight, Saturday, 29 September 2018.
Trump's meeting in Western Virginia can be viewed online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably comment on this week's hearings of candidates for the Supreme Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh who have caused controversy over the charges of sexual abuse.
But the primary goal of this series of gatherings is to help the Republicans take advantage of November elections.
Therefore, Trump's Headquarters for the presidential campaign report that five meetings scheduled for next week aim to "stimulate volunteers and supporters because the Republicans are trying to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Most in Congress are so important for the president's plans that they will travel to as many countries as we enter a burnt campaign," anonymous spokesman of Trump's campaign told Reuters.
Tonight's meeting to be held in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump will visit Western Virginia for the second time in the last month on Saturday. In that country, he won with more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is behind in polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must help him improve his ratings in polls," politician Simon Haedar from the University of Western Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team left her heart on the ground before individual conflicts on Sunday
After a three-sided session, a couple's fight on Sunday afternoon might be exactly what it was supposed to turn over the Ryder Cup.
"The wheel of happiness turns" is a saying that is especially worth sports and in which athletes believe, and especially in competitions like this.
Who's the wheel of luck now?
"They had six points of advantage, and now they have four. So I think happiness is currently on our side," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europeans are in advantage of four points, while 12 points are left to the end of the game.
Spieth says that the Americans got a little wind in their backs and encouraged his game in pair with Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points after the entire game.
Spieth played killerly from tee to green and could serve as an example to others.
The cheerleading celebrating shouts were getting louder when Spieth and Thomas came to two points behind, and everything culminated by the key path by which Spieth came to an unsolved result.
After the way he won the 15-hole game, there was a similar cheerleader scream in which hope and faith that Americans could turn everything around.
"You just need to concentrate and think about your game," Spieth said.
That's all those players have now.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players who won more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, sensation Ryder Cup.
The European strange but irresistible couple has a maximum number of points and can't be wrong.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who didn't lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but he also escaped bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
This winning sequence, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinaria, shows that just those players that need to win on Sunday. There is no more popular player than those two who can seal Europe's victory while the sun sets over Paris Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too soon to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergie Garcia who had a great performance in this morning's couples' game.
One boogey and two double boogeyes in the first nine holes in the playground buried the Spanish and the Swedish man in a hole they couldn't dig out.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one who will help individuals dig themselves out of their hole.
It is fascinating to watch couple games close because you can see the interactions of players in pair, to hear advice that they don't give, as well as to study a strategy that can change at the moment.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and in the last day they enter with significant advantage, but this couple game has also shown that the US team has the necessary combatability, in which some, especially the States, doubted.
Europeans in the last day Ryder Cupa enters with leadership of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday games in couples in the last day Ryder Cupa enter with significant advantage over the United States of 10 : 6.
The dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victorys over Tiger Woods led with four points of difference on Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn in an effort to win the trophy that got her out of Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning games in couples, reaching a score of 3 : 1.
The American team has shown greater combat in couples by winning two games, but the difference in points has already been great.
Eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday should be collected to win the Jim Furyk trophy.
Fleetwood is the first debitant from the European team who won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, known as "Molliwood", after the sensational weekend only the other couple who won four points in the game in pairs in Ryder Cup history.
After they defeated Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they showed themselves superior in the game against Woods and the US debitant Bryson Dechambeau by winning 5&4.
Woods who didn't show the best performance in two Saturday games performed some genius moves, but now there are 19 defeats of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return with partner Henrik Stanson to the game with couples and to experience the defeat of 2&1 of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the first and third best player in the world.
However, the Europeans did not exactly go as greased during a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
The Triple Winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas won two points on Sunday and thus set the scale high to their American team.
First they defeated the Spanish man John Rahm and Ian Poulter with a result of 2 & 1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after the first two holes lost.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cupa team that was behind four points was able to return to individual games, although Furyk's team only needs an unsolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days behind, a weekly counterattack seems to be hard for them.
North Korea declares "no chance" for unilateral disarmment without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions increase confidence in the United States and there is no chance that North Korea will unilaterally disarm and give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said in the UN General Assembly that North Korea last year has taken "significant measures of goodwill", for example, stopped nuclear and missile tests, demontated the nuclear station for testing and decided to stop the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"But we have not received a satisfactory reaction from the United States," he added.
"If we do not trust in the United States, we do not have faith in our national security.
Although Ri reiterated the known complaints of North Korea on Washington's resistance to "step" access to denuclearisation in which North Korea would gradually suspend sanctions, his statement was significant because he did not reject unilateral denuclearisation as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri refers to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statement at the first meeting in the history of the current President of the United States and North Korea leaders in Singapore on June 12th, when Kim made a promise to work on the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump guaranteed the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean war that lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States conditioned Pjongjang to give up nuclear weapons before that.
Washington also ignored calls for reducing strict international sanctions for North Korea.
"The US insists that denuclearisation be done before that and increases pressure by sanctions to forcely achieve its goal, and even opposes "the declaration of end of war", Ri added.
"Perception that sanctions can throw us on our knees is only the delusion of people who don't know anything about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases confidence."
Ri didn't mention whether there were plans for the second meeting of Kim and Trump that the President of the United Nations spoke about earlier this week in the United Nations.
However, the minister pointed out that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in held three meetings in the last five months and added: "If the denuclearisation demanded South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this end."
Regardless of all, the tone of Rio's speech was far different from last year when he spoke to the UN General Assembly and said the targeting of the continental US missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim "human missile" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened the "complete destruction" of North Korea last year in the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there is much more work ahead of them and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea performs denuclearisation.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no timeframe for denuclearisation and added: "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia expressed the view that the UN Security Council should be awarded Pjongjang for measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue strictly until complete, final and verified denuclearisation occurs."
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions for North Korea in 2006 in an effort to stop the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic programme.
Pompeo met with Rijea in the UN's main assembly and then said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit hasn't been well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said there was progress, but North Korea called him after several hours for "gangster demands".
North Korea arranged a meeting with Moon this month to demonstrate a missile location and a nuclear complex that will be achieved if the United States take "appropriate measures".
He added that Kim revealed to him that these "appropriate measures" relate to security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps towards stabilisation of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard attend a course to learn how to rest well
The new course at Harvard University enabled all students to get a good sleep in trying to fight more widespread culture of learning with caffeine and sleepless nights.
The academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea of the basics of concern for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep at the Harvard Medical Faculty and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course that he considers to be the first of these in the United States.
The idea of the course came after he held a speech on the effect of deprivation of a dream to learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came to me and said, “Why did I just find out this now, in the last year of college? ”
She said nobody told her how important her dream was, which surprised me," The Telegraph said.
For the first time this year, the course explains to students how good sleeping habits help in academic and sports success and generally improve health.
The professor of psychology at the University of Medicine at Harvard and the CEO of the University of Paul Barreira said that the University decided to introduce a course after a serious lack of sleep was observed in students during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a study bedroom where students must click coffee cups, curtains, tennis and books to find out the effects of caffeine and light, how sleep shortage affects success and how important the routine of sleeping is.
During the lecture, students find out that a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a campus map with interactive icons that encourages students to consider their daily routine.
"We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know how cigarettes affect health," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride to study all night before the exam continues, says professor and adds that modern technology and increasing pressure on students proves that the lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
Professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality dream. Sleeping also helps to fight thickness because the lack of sleep affects the brain, throws it into a state of hunger and causes constant hunger.
Raymond So, 19-year-old chemistry and biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler make a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to expand his course to the whole campus.
As the next step, he plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study subject before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends students to turn on the alarm during their sleep, as well as during the awakening. They must be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as the LED lights that may disrupt the circadial rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after the hit by Dolly Menge cut off Steven Gerrard's lack of defense and ended the game by winning Livingston with score 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win the first victory after the triumph in February and 4 : 1 in St. Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches, so his team is now behind eight points in the Ladbrokes Prime Ministership for the leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the semi-time, and the Rangers seem to have lost inspiration, and it didn't seem to even the result.
While the Rangers now fell to the sixth place, Livingston climbed to the third with only one hit of the difference behind Hibernian.
There could be a new problem for the Rangers after the Line Judge Calum Spence got a head injury when some item was thrown out of the distance.
Gerrard made eight changes on his hips and so swollen by Ayro to the Bethfred Bathroom semifinal.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same line of Livingston that took the Hearts' measure last week and would be thrilled that his well-designed establishment suffocated every attempt of opponent.
The Rangers may have had a ball more in their possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They had a shot two minutes after Menga was kicked out of the game for the first time that opened space for Scott Pitttman to go to the naked Allan McGregor, however, the chain missed that opportunity.
Deep free hit by Keaghan Jacobs intercepted Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only forward an inaccurate strike towards the back rows.
Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game, they seemed to play with hope instead of conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge had to judge the eleven in the 15th minute after his crash with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson failed to comply with the Columbia request.
In the first half, the Rangers managed to point only two balls to naked, but the former doorman of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, one hit by the head of Lassan Coulibaly and Pitomi punched Ovie Ejaria, was not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute game of Livingston has slowed down the game, no one can deny their efforts.
The Rangers missed again using Jacobs' deep regained ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson who kept his privacy and chose Menga to simply end the attack.
Gerrard reacted during his break and replaced Coulibaly Ryan Kent. The replacement almost had the current effect because the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to drag visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett struck one long shot after others.
Holt’s side could have extended the leadership in the final moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wider collision from the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton was looking for an eleven once later because he tripped with Jacobs, but Thomson also took a look this time.
Almanah: Geiger's inventor
And now there is a page from our Almanah in the "Sunday Morning" show: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago and several days ago... the birth of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measurement of radioactivity, and the invention later developed a device known as Geiger's counter.
The main point of science since that time, Geiger's counter also became the main point of pop culture, for example in the 1950 "Bells of Colorado" film in which the main roles had seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in God’s name is this? ”
Rogers: “This is Geiger’s counter, and it is used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms that react to the radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: “Look at that, it's heard! ”
Hans Gaiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" bad cells and destroy them
"The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient and their changes to the laboratory
The stations are treated so they can "recognize" the protein that is common to many cancer species and then re-inject in patients
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman treated with a vaccine taught by the immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has retreated over 18 months.
The procedure includes the extraction of immune system cells from the patient, their change in the laboratory to know "recognised" protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer and re-injecting cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the American National Institute for Cancer in Bethesd in the Allied State Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 stimulates growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and colon cancer," prof. Berzofsky explained.
Similar approach to extracting immune system cells from the patient and their “teaching” how to recognize cancer cells was successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West was involved in the Trump debate after the Saturday Night Live show and supported it, wearing a hat with the inscription "Let's Make America Large again".
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was whispered in a study during the Saturday Night Live show after the breakup performances in which he praised US President Donald Trump and announced that he would run for President 2020.
After performing the third song of the evening called Ghost Town during which he wore a hat with the inscription "Remake America Great again", he continued to speak against the Democrats and repeatedly supported Trump.
"I talk to white people so often and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
The show Saturday Night Live started a satiric sketch in which Matt Damon mocked the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the US Justice Committee on the claims of Christine Blasey Ford for sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the video of West's speech to social networks was transmitted by comedian Chris Rock.
He doesn't know if he was trying to mock West.
Also, West complained to the public that they were throwing him behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
"They bothered me behind the stage.
They said to me, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
They bullied me!
They said I went down," Washington Examiner quoted.
West continued: “You want to see the bottom, ” and said he would wear his Superman coat because that means I can’t tell him what to do.
"Try with love."
The magazine Variety wrote that his comments were at least twice caused by public discouragement, and the members of the Saturday Night Live show seemed embarrassed, while one person said to the magazine: "The whole studio shut up."
West was invited at the last moment as a replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Raper Mac Miller passed away a few days earlier.
West performed the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of mineral water Perrier, astonished many.
Westa supported Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative group, who posted on Twitter: “One of the bravest people: Thank you for stepping up to the MAFI.”
But Karen Hunter's show manager on Twitter announced that West was simply his own and that it was absolutely wonderful.
"But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his "artitude") for whom I believe he accepts and expands ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And we are," she added.
Before the show, a rapper posted on Twitter that he changed his name, saying he is now "will be officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist who changed his name and followed Diddy's steps, also known under the names of Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Raper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed the name to a symbol, and then into an artist known as Prince.

The Series Star Kit Harington's Throne Game has turned on toxic maleity
Kit Harrington is known for the role of Jon Snow who handles the sword in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of the throne.
However, 31-year-old actor has stereotyped the macho hero, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they must be strong to gain respect.
In the The Sunday Times Culture interview, Kit said he believed that "something went wrong" and wondered how to cope with the problem of toxic maleity in #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old colleague Rose Leslie from the Throne Game, admitted that he wanted to "very determined" face this problem.
"Personally I feel very determined at this point – where have we made a mistake with maleity?" he asked himself.
"What have we taught men, as they grew up, compared to the problem we now see?"
Kit believes that television, thanks to very male characters on the screen, could be partially responsible for increasing toxic maleity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, and that boys feel that they have to have certain features of a man?
I think that's actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
'Cause obviously something went wrong for the boys."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not record the series continues The Game of thrones after its end next summer and said he "finished with battlefields and horses".
Since November, Kit will act in a new performance of True West's author Sam Shepard, the story of the film producer and his brother's robber.
The actor recently discovered that he felt that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the shooting of the Throne Game.
"I met my wife by recording this show, which gave me my family and my future life," he found out.
Rose was in a fantastic show that won the Emmy Prize played the role of Ygritta, the love of Keith's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the property of Leslien's family in Scotland.
HIV/SIDA: China reported an increase in new 14% disease cases
China announced that 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS increased.
Healthcare workers say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were recorded only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases of infection have been transmitted by sex, which is a change compared to the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, the health authorities said that the person who is infected with HIV is almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV to sex is a constant problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is decriminalized in China in 1997, but there are rumours that the discrimination of LGBT is a great person.
Studies estimate that 70 - 90% of men who have sexual relations with other men will eventually marry a woman because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of transfer of disease in such relationships occur because of inadequate protection during sex.
As part of the effort to deal with the problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of the public's staff has received information on the GOP senators, calling it "dangerous lies" and "theory of conspiracy"
The US representative Maxine Walters on Saturday denied the statements that a member of her staff published personal data from three Republican US senators on Wikipeda's websites.
The Democratic Representative from Los Angeles assures you that the claims are spreading by individuals "the ultra-right wing", as well as the web site.
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The published data reportedly contained home addresses and Utah senator Lindsey Graham's phone numbers from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the network on Thursday, and it was published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate committee on claims on the sexual offence of candidates of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The information came out after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that reveals the source of the publication belongs to the office of the representative Waters, as well as information on the representative's staff member, the newspaper The Hill reported.
"These unfounded suggestions are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security are compromised as the consequences of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for leaking these data.
These unfounded suggestions are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Mrs Waters' statement quickly attracted critics on the Internet, including former spokesperson of the White House Ari Fleischer.
"This is angry denial," wrote Fleischer.
"It shows that Waters has no temper to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he hasn't done must not be angry.
He must not be defiant.
He mustn't question the motives of the defendant.
It must be calm and steady."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction to Barbara Walters with criticisms directed by the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, whom they accused of appearing too angry during the hearing Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate competing against Waters in the general elections, also voted on Twitter.
"It is important if it is true," he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that her office informed the "measurable bodies and bodies of the order" about these false claims.
"We will make sure the perpetrators are discovered and they will bear legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
Film review "Johnny English: Again on the mission" – not interesting Rowan Atkinson fighting spies
It is now common in every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems that in the new screening of the action series "Johnny English" whose first continuation called "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screens with the title "Johnny English" again.
Will the curtained own satire about how obviously we are worth becoming a new national export opportunity?
Incompetent Johnny English with skinned eyes and rubber faces again has a license to complicate the situation, while his name is more than anything to say that it is a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries in which cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a distracted secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretenses on "declined" glamur reminds of Inspector Clouseau, has a breath of character Mr Bean and somehow reminds the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of London Olympic Games 2012.
His character is also inspired by a traveler and a mysterious world man that Atkinson once played in now forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the image of chaos.
There are one or two suitable moments in this latest edition of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English got close to a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the propeller hit his helmet for a while.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninterestable and unusually surprising, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "impossible missions" and offer themselves comedy elements.
Humor seems to be destined for children, not for adults, and in my opinion, the freaky history of Johnny English is not as innovative and focused as the Atkinsons are inhabited in the image of Mr Bean.
The presumption that the Great Britain is in serious trouble is now a common fact.
The hacker entered the most secret British spy web and discovered the identity of all British agents, on the horror of agents on duty, who, unfortunately, played Kevin Eldon in short appearances.
This has spilled a glass of the prime minister's patience, the superior and war-scale character who experiences a complete dissolution of the system because it is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries faithfully to display a character that should represent Theresa May, but she has not exactly received material to do something with.
Intelligence advisers reveal to her that all active spys are compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as director of some fancy school, but secrets teaches how to become a secret agent: there are several handsome gegs here because English teaches spying in rock style.
The English quickly bring to government rooms for an emergency meeting, where they meet with Bough, their former partner and their eternal sacrifice, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an enthusiastic commander of the submarine acting as Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is mostly wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing all the wrong thing return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, who was captured by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously falling under the influence of a charismatic technological billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, the evil Jason Walta that Jake Lacy is playing.
English and Bough start their exciting trip with absurd and funny stories: disguised as waiters burned the fancy French restaurant, challenged a huge mess smuggling on the Volta luxury yacht, and English provoked a complete anarchy by trying to use the phones for virtual reality to find out what the Volta house looks like.
Everything has been done properly for this last continuation, but however attractive and deliberate the film, it still contains a lot of children's elements.
It's quite a central achievement.
And as it was with other Johnny English movies, again I wondered, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that would fit his talent?
The Labourist Party refuses to develop a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days
The Labourist Party of Jeremy Corbyn will consider a radical plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid for five-day work.
The party reportedly wants the company's heads to save their workers from the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and give them an additional day off.
That would mean that employees would have the right to a three-day weekend with the same salary.
Sources suggest that the idea could be "included" in the party's economic programme and plans for the country to favour the interests of workers.
The union convention supported the shift to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high source from the Labour Party told the newspaper "The Sunday Times": "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not be achieved overnight, but it is an aspiration that fits in the approach that this party has towards the balance of the economy in favour of workers, as well as in the entire industrial strategy of the party."
The Labourist Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also pledged a four-day working week during its general election campaign for 2017.
However, the Laburist Party does not fully accept the effort.
Laburist Party spokesman said "The four-day working week is not party policy and the party is not considering it."
The Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to develop his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he decided to abduct power from the hands of "noble directors" and "profiters" in the municipal companies.
The Shadow Chancellor plans also mean that the current shareholders in the hydroeconomic companies may not be able to regain their overall role because the Laburist government could make "deductions" based on the irregularities observed.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in administrative boards of companies and to create inclusive ownership funds to give 10% of private companies capital to employees who would earn annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are talking about "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation on the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his bid for the Supreme Court in at least a week and asks if the agency's conclusion can affect the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, correspondent "60 Minutes", Scott Pelley, asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a chance that the FBI could find out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said going to the debate, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that happened, after they were given your instructions, and I said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, indecisive, unequivocable."
Graham's voice, however, as if it was cut in a stone.
"I am determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really need a strong accusation to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has denied everything decisively," Graham added thinking of Christine Blasey Ford.
"None of the persons she appointed could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything has changed."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has he accomplished anything about reducing poverty?
These Saturdays in New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – the end of poverty in the world.
For the past seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only the performances of stars, such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty until 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, the international conspiracy group in hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (except if they were not willing to pay the VIP ticket), concert visitors had to perform a series of tasks or "works" such as volunteering, sending e-mail to the world leader, telephone calls or any other meaningful ways of raising awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually given that he has 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people to demand an invitation to action, or just another case called "clictivism" – where people feel that signing online petitions or sending tweet really changes something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has argued that he has recorded more than 19 million "actions" of its supporters seeking to achieve a number of different goals.
It claims that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to a amount greater than $37 billion that will affect lives by 2030 more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided have been directly affected by nearly 649 million people around the world so far.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, the investor partnership in the United Kingdom, which is advocated to “help children to develop up to their full potential”, with a promise that after receiving more than 4700 tweets from the citizens of the world, they will provide 35 million dollars for the help of Ruanda to end feeding in the area.
"With the help of the United Kingdom government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world, such as you, we can achieve that social injustice of nutrition becomes only a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, an ambassador to the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project to ensure food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on our website that says, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replies: “It will be a long and difficult journey . Sometimes we will experience failure.
But we will succeed, just as the great movements for civil rights and against the apartmentheid before us, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknda, Shawn Mendesa, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe belong to some of the performances at this year's event in New York that will lead Debora-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy as a "blocade" to prevent Russian energy exports
Washington can, "if necessary", use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East, US Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke said the Russian engagement in Syria was particularly where it acted at the call of the legitimate government Ö an excuse for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for Russia in the Middle East is that she wants to sell energy in that area as it does in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States with the help of the Navy can ensure the openness of maritime roads and blockade, if necessary, in order to ensure that their energy does not come to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance, which is represented in the United States as "the voice of energy consumers".
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out they're exactly the same.
"The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less exploitation and fuel replacement," he said, and for Russia, it says "it serves the same trick" in economies depending on fossil fuels.
The statements were made simultaneously with the intention of Trump's administration to increase exports to Europe by replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, officials of Trump's administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2 (North Stream 2), which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "container" of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly stressed that gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, worth 11 billion dollars, which would double the existing capacity of gas pipeline up to 110 billion cubic metres, a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that a fierce opposition to Washington project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the opinion that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's position has triggered a reaction to Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state is involved in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after the recent meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "really consider" the possibility to run for president in 2020, says Senator of the Allied State Massachusetts
Senator of the Allied State Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "really consider" the presidential bid after medieval elections.
During a direct meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking that she was running herself.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means the woman headed," The Hill quoted it as saying.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
Warren made an opinion on President Donald Trump during the meeting with citizens, saying "this country leads in the wrong direction".
"I'm awfully worried about Donald Trump doing our democracy," she said.
Warren openly criticised Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet published on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that most Warren's voters do not think it should be run in 2020.
According to the research of the Center for Political Research of the University of Suffolk / Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the "probable" voters in Massachusetts said that the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent backed the candidacy.
The poll has shown greater support for the bidder of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent of the votes for potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
The other prominent names of the Democrats who discussed the potential presidential race in 2020 were former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after applying in September.
Arrested and accused of a family violence incident on Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after the return, is comparable to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other wounds with which our soldiers are returning," he told the audience at Donald Trump's meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that was silent and for his son and other war veterans said that "they are returning a little different, returning hardened, wondering if they have respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military members have given for this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Aljaska, and was accused of family violence against a woman's person, disrupting the application of family violence and possession of weapons in alcoholised condition, says Dan Bennett, spokesman of the police administration of the city of Wasilla.
18 federal states and D.C. support the review of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of the new US policy that deprives asylum to victims fleeing gangs or family violence.
Representatives of 18 federal states and counties submitted a friendly report Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers who challenge politics, NBC News reported.
A full name of prosecutors in Grace's lawsuit against the Sessions filed by the US Civil Liberty Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum request on July 20th.
She was arrested in Texas.
State lawyers who supported Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a number of asylum applicants come in the United States, as countries facing all-experienced problems with gangs and family violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States has changed the decision of the Committee on Immigration in 2014, which allows immigrants who have no documents, and flee from family violence, to submit a request for asylum.
The state attorney of the Colombia County, Karl Racine, said in his statement Friday that a new policy " ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"The Allied Law requires that all asylum requirements be resolved on the basis of concrete facts and circumstances of the lawsuit, and such obstacle violates this principle," a friend of the court said.
Lawyers further argued that the immigrants' immigration policy would harm the US economy, arguing that it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and "secure the necessary labour force".
Chief Attorney of State Jeff Sessions ordered judges for immigration to stop approving asylum to victims fleeing family violence and violence to gangs in June.
"Azil is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for race, religion, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his statement on the policy on June 11th.
The purpose of asylum has never been to mitigate all the problems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of victims is doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly difficult.
"The situation is very tense," Risa Kusuma's 35-year-old mother said, while comforting her boy who shaking at the fever in the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"The ambulance is transported by bodies every minute.
The government's lack of clean water."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals, damaged by a 7.5 degree earthquake, were loaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a break in his back and shoulders, rested in front of the Military Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in the open due to continuation of strong subsequent earthquakes.
The tears filled his eyes as he spoke of the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was pinned inside the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, and added that his family came to town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "molting" through "propagand ads"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page long ad in the US daily list that promoted the mutual benefit of the US and China trade, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of abuse of American propaganda press.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump focused on the paid addition of China Daily newspapers in the most sold newspapers in Iowa, Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere with the US Congressional elections on November 6th, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere with the US election marked what US officials described as a new escalation phase of Washington's campaign to push China.
While it is normal that foreign governments are putting commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that led to high import tariffs.
The retaliation of China in the beginning of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries such as Iowa supporting Trump's Republican Party, citing Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term Governor Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing harmed US workers, farmers and companies.
In an article in the Sunday newspaper Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China "now doubles this harassment by launching propaganda ads in our own free press."
"By expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American free speech tradition and free press by putting a paid ad in Des Moines register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find limited voices of opposition on the newspaper kiosk on the streets of Beijing and you will not see any real reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people can have on the disturbing Chinese economic path because the media are under strong pressure by the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were concerned.
Kavanaugh's Debacle Republicans Remote Voices Before Mediterranean Elections, Analysts Warn
Since many Republicans stand by the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh and defended him for several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn that this would lead to negative reactions during the upcoming medieval elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding this event were quite upset, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to give their vote.
Such things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that the last insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizon) in conducting the FBI investigation would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said on Friday Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokeswoman of the Modeon progressive group, according to the newspapers in Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang: "There comes November!", protesting in the Senate hall while the Republicans who control the Justice Committee were preparing to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Entusiasm and democratic motivation will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a non-party political analyst, told news.
"People say they are already high, which is true.
But they could be taller, especially among women in suburbs and younger voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't go to elections."
Even before the public testimony of Ford, in which its claims of sexual assault were detailed by the candidate for the Supreme Court's Judge, analysts suggest that a negative reaction could occur if the Republicans continue with confirmation.
"This is a real mess for the Great Old Party," NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee President, as saying earlier last week.
"It is not only about voting in the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh has been sent to the reserve bench, but also about how the Republicans have approached all this and how they treated it," Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities Association of the United States, the group that assists in choosing Democrats.
However, it seems that the Americans are somewhat divided about who they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a little more leaning on him.
The new poll published by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of subjects definitely or likely believes in the truth of the Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent have declared that they are safe or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that he thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent claimed the same for Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations Ford made, along with at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford was testifying to the Senate's Justice Board under oath last week that Kavanaugh attacked her in a drunken state when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez argued that the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at the party during the Yale Study in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web, launches a new company aimed at becoming a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that develops on the basis of Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and people to be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the intention behind the Inrupt "World Domination".
"We must do it now," he said thinking of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, lists of commitments, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access which information is fully available.
The company calls it "personal training through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is that the company provides resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed the project's work contract, as well as the community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, development engineers from around the world could have developed their own decentralised applications using tools available at the Inrupt web site.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team did not talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not they would introduce a complete change in which all their business models would be completely turned overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994 Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Technological Institute (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee had an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Even as the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, World Wide Web Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating the award of a priest from the First World War with Victoria's cross
Celebrating in honor of the only priest of the Anglican Church, who was awarded Victoria's cross as a fighter in the First World War , was encompassed in his hometown 100 years later .
Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on September 29, 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out he was given the greatest British military honor.
The memorial stone revealed two of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s grandpa's engaging.
According to the report of the London Gazette Official Journal on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion across St. Quentin’s channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire that came from the direction of the battlefield and machinery. ”
Later, he rushed into the front rows and with "incredibly bravery" led the troops forward before he ran into the Polish cannon without any help and cut three of the military squad.
Colonel Vanna killed a German sniper on October 4th, 1918, a little more than a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 27, said that his grandfather’s deeds were “something I know I could never accomplish, and that causes humility. ”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the parade orchestra Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
The fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they got the Peppa Pigs
Imagine this you stay awake all night to watch a series of Bellator 206 matches to eventually prevent you from tracking the main event.
The San Jose programme consisted of 13 battles, including six on the main list, and in Britain were displayed live on channel 5 at night.
At six o'clock in the morning, just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match together, the viewers in the Great Britain remained in shock when the transfer broke off the Peppa Pig.
Many were not impressed at all after fighting only kept up until early morning.
A fan of discontinuation with child's cartoon on Twitter described as a "some sort of sick joke".
"Supposed to state regulation, this content is not suitable for broadcasting at 6:00 in the morning, so they had to transfer to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communications of Bellator, when they asked him about the transfer.
"Jupi, Piggy Peppa."
President Bellator, Scott Coker, said he would coordinate his schedules to include viewers from the Great Britain in the future.
"When I consider repression, I think we can probably sort something out," Coker said.
"But the transfer is there at 6 a.m. on Sunday and we will not be able to realise anything until Sunday is present with us, when they will already have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was disconnected, there were many copies that weren't even friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't.
I can promise you that next time, it won't come to that.
We're going to keep five fights instead of what we're doing, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Dessert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" about sexuality
The Olympic jumper in the water Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority compared to others because of his sexuality, but it gave him motivation to become successful.
Twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school he wasn't aware that "not everyone like me".
In his statement to Radio 4 Dessert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about homosexual rights in order to give others hope.
He also said his victory in the Olympics has been less important since he became a father.
The regular long-term director, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of the disease.
By appearing as an apostate in Laverna's first show, Daley said that during his growing up he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls".
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity were the right things that gave me power and strength so that I could succeed. ”
He says he wanted to prove he was "something" so he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
A double bronze Olympic medal winner has become a prominent person who advocates LGBT individuals and has used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy that he could live without consequences and that he wanted to give others “hope. ”
The Triple World Championship said he was surprised that he fell in love with a man of the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married a Oscar, who was 20 years older than him last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem to him.
"When you are going through so many things" he looked back at his first Olympic games when he was 14 years old, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said it was hard to find someone the same age and experienced similar rises and falls.
In June they became the parents of the son they named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all perspective" changed.
"If you asked me last year, all the story would be about "I must win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals.
Robbie is my golden Olympic medal."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 40 years after his brain tumor was diagnosed.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was whether they got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: "Dad, you won't be here long enough to be in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand while he was out, and only after he stopped breathing and died, I finally became aware that he was not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley was competing in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I dreamed of my whole life to jump in front of a domestic audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It was also an inspiration for selecting the first song " Proud" of Heather Small Ö singing in it during preparations for the Olympic Games and on which it always gets narrowed .
Dessert Island Discs is broadcast at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to fully recover the form to avoid an unpleasant turning point.
Mickelsson, who plays a record twelve time in this two-year competition, sent Captain Jim Furyk to the bench in Saturday games with four balls and fours.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as it was often for the United States, the five-strong winner spent the day in cheering and developing his game at the exercise site hoping to correct what was bothering him.
Never the most precise player, even at the peak of his career, this 48-year-old is not ready for demanding field Le Golf National, where a long stiff field routinely punishes inaccurate blows.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson faces the British Open Molinari on Sunday's 9th match, who won all four matches this week with the newest Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual matches at four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's game could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had faith in his man more than that and couldn't say.
"He fully understood the role he had today, stumbled on my back, hugged me, and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"There's a lot of confidence."
He's famous and has contributed a lot to teams in the past, and this week.
I sure as hell didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined there'd be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's how we should do it.
He wants to be on the ground, like everyone else."
Mickelson will override Nick Fald's record on Sunday by the number of Ryder Cup matches.
This could mark the end of his career at the Ryder Cup which has never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven semi-times, although Furyk said his presence also brought certain immaterial values to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy for it," he explained.
"I think younger players had fun with him this week, who was fun to watch.
He gives a lot more than a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of the Ryder Bath can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Danac debuted in a match in Valderrama in 1997, where the team of Captain Sevea Ballesteros had the advantage of five points compared to the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a close difference of 141.2
"You constantly recall that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but with a narrow difference," said Bjorn, in the picture, after he watched the team in 2018, which won the score of 5 § 3 on Friday and yesterday led the score of 10° 6 on the field Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
You'll play with full force tomorrow.
Get on the ground and do everything you can.
Nothing's over until the floor's on the board.
We have a goal, which is to try to win this trophy, and that remains focus.
I speak all the time, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we are quite aware of who stands against us the biggest players in the world."
Enthusiastic with the performance of my players on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in this before the mide.
Tomorrow we must face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and that's something completely different.
It's excellent to play with a partner when everything goes well, but when you're there as an individual, they're at the ultimate exam of your golfing skills.
It's a message you have to convey to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammate because he must do the best."
Unlike Bjorn, his colleague on the opposite side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they played with the teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these major turns of the last day, since he was part of the Brookline winning team before he ended up a loser after Europe performed "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, said in answer to the question that he encouraged his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the very beginning like what you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
When that trip goes in a certain direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the middle matches.
In line with that, we organized our line and set up our boys as if, you know, we're gonna try to perform magic tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I have decided that this group of boys will go in this order because I believe it covers everything," Bjorn said about selected players for individual matches.
Germany's new warship back on hold
The latest фреgate of the German Navy was to be launched in 2014 to replace old warships from the Cold Wartime, but it will not be ready until next year because of malfunctioned systems and cost increases, local media reported.
The launch of the “Rheinland-Pfalz” ship, a full-new new fregate class of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit by citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying about problems after delivery struck the fate of an ambitious project.
Four class vessels Baden-Wuerttemberg, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old Fregate Class Bremen.
As far as it is known, it will have a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period Ö should be possible to allocate the latest fregates during the period of up to two years without returning to the home ports.
However, constant delays mean that the most contemporary warships of war are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power abroad by the time entering the service will become obsolete, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate fregate F125 arrived on all the covers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to release the ship into use and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
It was little known about the reasons for return, but the German media cited a number of key "software and hardware deficiencies" that would make the warship useless if it were sent to the battle mission.
Software shortages were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will manage a crew of about 120 sailors half less than on the older bremen frogs.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically too heavy that reduces its efficiency and restricts the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
It is believed that Rheinland-Pfalz of 7000 tonnes is twice the size of ships similar to the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the incorrect hardware, the price of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have reached an amazing €3.1 billion (3.6 billion) compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
Problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the German maritime forces are reducing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Defence Committee, admitted that the Navy actually "falls ships capable of ordering".
The official said that the problem has risen over time because the old ships have been put out of the drive, and there were no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg frogs can join the Navy.
The National Foundation taps the secret life of bats
New research carried out on a property in Scotland High aims to find out how bats use landscapes to hunt food.
There is hope that the results will clarify the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help to manage future conservation activities.
The study conducted by scientists at the National Foundation for Scotland (NTS) will follow ordinary and swamp bats, as well as brown long-rolled and river bats in Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key places around the property to monitor bat activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile checks using hand detectors.
The expert analysis of the sound of all the videos will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind of thing does.
There will be a map of habitat and a report to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, consultant for the protection of the nature of the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal what habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of working on habitats management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forest surfaces for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have significantly decreased over the past century.
They are jeopardized by constructions and works on the device that affect shelters and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a danger, as well as muhols and certain chemical treatments of construction material, and attacks of pet cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, because of their habits of hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to find bugs and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, shelter inspections and sometimes save.
The organization even set the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the Treave estate in Dumfrey and Galloway, in which eight of the ten types of bats dwell in Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is an ideal area for them.
"We have an enormous space for bats here in Threave," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there is much more that we don't know about bats, so the work we do here and on other facilities will help us understand better what they need for progress."
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting works on maintenance within buildings, since unintentionally destroying a single bed can kill up to 400 females and young women, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and illegal to kill, torture, or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, representative of the Scottish Bat Protection Association, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we simply do not know how their population is progressing. ”
Ronaldo rejects rape claims while lawyers are about to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of rape that has been made against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will prosecute the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Apparently then he paid her $375 000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video that installed on Instagram for his 142 million followers several hours after the charges, Ronaldo 33, criticised the statements as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news," says the five-fold Golden Ball winner in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything's fine," a football player added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," Reuters said.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the football player would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount corresponding to the weight of the offences, which is probably one of the most difficult injuries in personal rights in the past few years".
The alleged incident was reported in June 2009 in the hotel and casino Palms in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer room, where he allegedly raped her analytically, according to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in Nevada.
The mayor claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said "99%" is a "good guy" that failed the "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had a sexual relationship, but that he had an agreement.
The mayor also argued that she went to the police and that they photographed her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an alien settlement because she "feared retaliation" and was concerned that she would be "publicly humiliated".
Thirty-four-year-olds say she wants to cancel the settlement now because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a transition to Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian div Juve as part of a 100 million-euro transition.
Brexit: UK will "respect forever" for losing car manufacturers
UK "will regret forever" if after Brexit loses the status of the world's car production leader, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that "disturbing" what Toyota UK told BBC that, in case Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, will temporarily stop production at its Burnastone factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of waiting at the borders in the Brexit case without an agreement could cause the loss of jobs.
The Burnastone engine that produces Toyotu Auris and Avensis has produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"It is my point that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement, we will experience the congestion of production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyote's general director in Burnastone.
Other car manufacturers in the UK voiced fears about leaving the EU without agreement due to possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Hondu, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says he's going to close his Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of the car manufacturer refers to the risks in the supply chain in the Brexit case without an agreement reached.
Toyota's production line works according to the principle of "Right on time", where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars operated on orders.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, there could be a break at the border for which the industry says it could lead to delays and lack of parts.
Toyota at her factory in Derbyshire couldn't hold more supplies than the ones needed for one day, they said from that company, so production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We must agree. We want to achieve the best possible deal that will allow, as I say, not only maintaining the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," BBC's 4 programme told today.
"Proofs not only Toyote, but also other producers show that we must absolutely be able to continue this very successful supply chains."
In Toyota, they could not tell how long production could be stopped, but they warned that in the long term, additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and who is a member of the Union, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, after these jobs are gone, they never come back.”
The government spokesman says "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says the White House
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "deferred in another week" to continue the fight against the candidate for Judge of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Lawyer Robert Mueller, who explores Russia's involvement in the elections, the connection between Trump's associates and Russia and the possible disruption of justice by the president.
The question is whether Trump will fire a deputy attorney and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence for months has been exposing gossip in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wire carrying to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused these statements.
But last Monday, he left for the White House in the middle of an announcement that he was about to resign.
Instead, Thursday was announced a meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order to avoid overlapping with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee, which was witnessed by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week's investigation of the FBI on charges against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up on TV on Sunday, Fox News.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not specified, it could be postponed this week; and it could be delayed in another week, taking into account everything else that happens with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to inform the press about everything."
Some journalists would challenge this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Master Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences is not the result of refusal to "theatrical behavior" of television reporters, even though she said, "I will not oppose the fact that they are distracted."
It then suggested that direct contacts between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president has organised more meetings for answers to questions than any president before him," she said, adding without stating evidence: "We analyzed the numbers."
Short talks will continue, Sanders said, but "if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to enable this often, and you could see that in the last few weeks, and just that you can talk to the President of the United States will replace short talks to the press."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Permanent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance before the crowded journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU employees in National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland for fear of Brexit
Health Minister sent a letter to EU staff employed in the Scottish NHS to express gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish parliament, sent a letter not full six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scotland government has already pledged to settle the costs of submitting a request for a stay status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the withdrawal have continued during the summer, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the United Kingdom government also strengthens preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So now I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Coworkers from all over the EU, as well as wider, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health services and help patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergone emergency surgery after head injury
Line player Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, was subjected to an emergency operation after he suffered a head injury in a Saturday defeat from the Vanderbilt Commodores club with a score of 31° 27, reports Mike The Authority from Tennessean.
Tennessee's chief coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injuries occurred just before the semi-time.
"He came to the playground line and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before they put it on the carriers and sent it to further searches.
The representative of the Tennessee State state state University told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie got out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there are no "details of type/range injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of a game train, plays the first season for Tennessee State after passing from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five blasts before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 rounds in the season.
Foreign customers will be charged with a higher fee in the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
According to new conservative plans, foreign customers will be charged with higher fees for buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people
This step will neutralize Corby's success to attract young voters
The increase in fees will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Treasury expects to raise up up to 120 million pounds a year for help for homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign customers will be charged with higher fees when buying real estate in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be taken as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters to promises to provide more favourable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The increase in the fee will be charged from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and will contribute additional money to the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee to be collected to the current fee, including an increase introduced two years ago to other homes and real estate purchased for the publication of Ö may be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects 120 million pounds per year to be collected by this move.
13 per cent of newly built properties in London are estimated to buy residents who do not have a residence in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first real estate to be involved in the company of those who have their own home.
Many wealthy areas in the country especially in the capital have become “downs of ghosts” due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the fee to help a larger number of young people reach their first home.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not using the country, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas to priceable real estates to correct "shame over the residential situation" in Britain.
Corbyn announced the proposal for a series of attractive residential reforms, including rental controls and the place of zero challenged deployment.
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my mandate to restoring the British dream that every new generation should be better.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
However, it can’t be right that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as foreign companies can buy homes as well as valuable British.
The dream of possession of home has become too far, and the shame of homelessness remains very real."
Jack Ross: "It's my ultimate ambition to manage Scotland"
Chief of Sunderland Jack Ross says his "end ambition" was one day to become the manager of Scotland.
The Scot (42) enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeast Club, which currently takes third place in the First League, with three points less than the leading.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Lights after he ran St. Mirren again last season at the Scottish soccer championship.
"I wanted to perform for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
"But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a child, and it always dragged me back.
But that opportunity could only be achieved if I were successful in running the club."
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland's place include Dick Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keane, Gus Poyett and Paul Di Canie.
The former head of Alloa Athletica says he didn't feel fear because he inherited such famous names in such a large club, after he previously refused calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at this point will be measured according to whether I will be able to return this club to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club certainly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again."
Ross is only a third year of his managerial career, after the period during which he was auxiliary chief in Dumbarton and 15-month experience as part of Hearts coach staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the edge of the fall to the champions' title next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his toy career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," Aloa recalled.
"I really believed that management was more than playing.
It sounds strange because I've been doing well, making solid money and enjoying quite successful times.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure, but management seems like the right thing.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I do, and I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I ever felt in my life."

The perfect time for the pint is at 5:30 on Saturday, as the research shows
The summer heat wave increased revenues to British pubs who were struggling with finances, but increased pressure on the chains of restaurants.
The data indicates that pubs and bars have achieved an increase in income in July by 2.7 per cent, but restaurant revenues are reduced by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, from the business consultation of the Office of the Chief Comptroller of Business Books, who collected the data, said: “The continued time and participation of England at the World Championship longer than it was expected to mean that July would be similar to the previous month of June, when the revenues of pubs grew by 2.8 percent, with the fact that restaurants were now even more affected.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the income of a restaurant in June just deteriorated in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly used have achieved much higher profits under the same conditions compared to the losses suffered by restaurants.
The pubs where food is mostly also suffered by heat, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In management bars and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent over the month, and the sale of food dropped by three per cent."
Paul Newman, an RSM holiday and entertainment analyst, said: "These results continue to be the trend we see since the end of April.
Time and impact of large social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling on the external market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to fight difficulties, although the decline of sales of 4.8 per cent per year will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for local managers in which food is served, and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the necessary breath."
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowing up of the shares of commodities.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitoring system for the British pubs, bars and restaurants collects and analyses data on the effectiveness of 47 operational groups, with total traffic of over 9 billion pounds, and an industrial reference value has been established.
One of five children has secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents
Research reveals that one of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, have secret accounts on social networks that hide from their parents and teachers
Interrogation of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "fake Insta" pages
News Increased fear of publishing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main" account showing their parents
One of five children, some of whom are only 11 years old, opens secret accounts on social networks that hide from adults.
A survey covering 20,000 high-school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Insta" account references to the web-location for the sharing of photographs.
The news has strengthened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said they use a cleared "main" account to show their parents, while they have private accounts at the same time.
A mother who encountered a secret website of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who encouraged other words "send me."
The study, carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of independent schools, showed that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, of which half admit to having private accounts.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be "glass of athlete" in the Scottish Athletic Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scotland Athletical Committee as an incompetent director at the annual board of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those leading sports to exploit its widespread experience gained at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and World Athletic community and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making it a member of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute to sports in Scotland."
The American, who won the race at 200 and 400 meters in the 1996 games in Atlanta, from its total four Olympic gold, now is the regular expert of the BBC, after the passing ischaemic attack he could no longer walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would show if I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but he was fully recovered, learned to walk again and today for the exercise of agility!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the Internet on a commercial for a traitor comparing mothers with cows
The company for the production of traitors with its advertising that breast-feeding mothers compares their children with the cows that the husband has been triggered by divided opinions on the Internet.
In order to mark the launch of a product that is claimed to be "the first silent wore traitor in the world", Elvie's consumer technology company published a commercial inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom that the new traitor gives to mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music that says, "Yes, I husband myself, but you see no tail" and "If you haven't noticed, this is not a vime, these are my breasts."
Then the refrain follows: “Pump, pump, feed the baby, pump, pump my ladies.”
However, the commercial, published on the Facebook page of the company, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed viewers' reactions, and many say it lights "uses" of the dairy industry.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that they steal their children a few days after birth," wrote one person.

Another person commented: “A reasonable traumatic mother and child.
But, yeah, why don't you use them to advertise traitors for mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added: “A total nonsense commercial. ”
Others defended the commercial, with a woman admitting that her song was "funny".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
The issue of milk made me feel just like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I realized it as it is.
This is a genius product," she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun commercial focused on dairy moms (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like“ cows. ”
This is not a commercial that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women revealed that they all danced with discreet traitors located in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who issue milk say they feel like cows.
The traitor Elvie, however, is completely quiet, no wires or pipes and is discreetly fitting in the breastbuilding bra, allowing women to move freely, keep their babies, and even go out during the betrayal.
Anna Balarin, a partner and executive creative director of the Mother Agency, commented: “The traitor Elvie is so revolutionary a product that deserves a brave and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between showing women and cows, we wanted to put the issue and all its challenges in a fun and understandable way to demonstrate the unbelievable sense of freedom that a new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that the traitor Elvie got to the front page.
During the London Week of fashion, the mother of two children showed up on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrants quietly transferred to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of detained children of migrants has increased although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because the severe rhetoric and policies introduced by Trump's administration have made it difficult to place children under the care of sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were immigrants without documents and feared to jeopardize their own possibility of staying in the country by stepping up and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before the congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who signed up to sponsor minors without escorts.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested earlier were not recorded in criminal records.
"Certainly 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or sponsors or members of the country's household are illegal, and many of them are criminal strangers.
So we continue looking for these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the statements of shelter workers, with the aim of faster conduct of child proceedings, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of imprisonment, not after 60 days, which was a standard earlier.
Many will appear via a video conference call, not personally, to present their legal status case before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the aid criteria will be deported quickly.
According to the statements of workers in the shelter and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely it will become anxious or depressing, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts of escape.
The advocators said that these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to his size, very likely signs that the child would be overlooked.
They added that transferring children to the tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to greet their friends can cause trauma with which many children are already fighting.
Syria commands US, French, Turkish "occupational forces" to retreat immediately
In addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has lasted eight years.
Moualem, who is also a deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the exception of the fight against terrorism, and that "they will also deal with it".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the parliament.
Moualem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, while millions have lost their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "fight in this holy battle until all Syrian territories were cleared" from terrorist groups and "any illegal presence of foreigners".
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who are mostly training and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-destructed country.
As for refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "proliferation of irrational fears" that encouraged refugees not to return.
"We have invited the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They are politicising what should be a pure humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no assistance for the restoration of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a tampon zone in the last major rebel point of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey agreement prevented a massive attack of Syrian forces with support from Russia's province in which three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would be aimed at jihadistes, including Nusra front fighters associated with Al-Qaeda, "which will be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to call the first meetings of a new committee drawn up by government members and opposition to form a post-war constitution for Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying the commission's work should be limited "to revise the article of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win the second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump should win the re-elections in 2020 unless many liberal viewers are likely to hope for, revocation and scandal ending his presidency too soon.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic finale of the presidency ever!"
There are no signs of fatigue of viewers at the moment.
Since 2014, the rating in the impact term has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the impact term, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" exceeded the rating with even 3.5 million viewers on the evenings of broadcasting the main news.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer producer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about the secretary of the government who becomes the president after the attack that destroys Capitol.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sniaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club” has a different theory.
He remembers driving a taxi in Boston before 2016.
The driver told her he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He replied: “Because he makes me laugh, ” Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a fun value in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories that come from Washington can determine the future of the law on the abortion of the prosecution of Roe against Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that can afford only the most privileged viewers.
However, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch that you've been watching a group of experts for the sixth hour discussing how Bob Woodward used the sources of the "deep background" for his book "Fear", about Paul Manafort's jacket of the ostrich skin worth 15,000 dollars (the suited object full of brazenness), writes Washington Post) and the implications of intimate descriptions, this, the anatomy of Mr Trumps given by Stormy Daniels.
I, for example, Super Maria will never look with the same eyes again.
"A part of what he makes you see him as a reality show is that he feeds you every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Pawnshow maker, about the rotating actor set and everyday Trump Show complications (fighting with N.F.L., commending Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss any episodes because you're going to be behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his house on the northern coast of the island of Kauai, it was sunny at 80 degree temperature (around 27 °C), but he was in there watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face-to-face with the Senate Justice Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hanging out about the end.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past, and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside is on the left of the most uncertain medieval election race for the congress
It is not surprising that the 17th Pennsylvania county experiences a flood of money, thanks to rebuilding the congressional districts, which resulted in two candidates in the race for the same place.
This recently rebuilt district of the Pittsburgh suburban area highlights the Democrat of Conor Lamba, who won a position in the second district in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is competing against another current representative, Keith Rothfus Republican, who currently represents the old 12th Pennsylvania county, which is largely contradicted with the new 17th county.
The maps were re-drawn after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally construed in favour of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17th county has launched a fight to finance campaigns between the main party fund collectors, the Committee collecting funds for a democratic campaign (DCCC) and the Republican National Congress Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the wide-supervised special March elections for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The position has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump has won a 20-point county.
Political analysts gave little advantage to Democrats.
The United States is concerned whether El Salvador should be punished for supporting China and then retreat
Diplomatics have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already admitted Beijing, with a small resistance of Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel from Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners kicked out Trump's management team.
State Department officials have decided to call the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "new decisions to recognise Taiwan again," Heather Nauert spokeswoman said.
However, the fines were examined only against El Salvador, who received the estimated $1 140 million US aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment rates and homicides.
As internal meetings advanced, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to continue a similar gathering last year, which was considered to be progress in efforts to prevent migrant movements from moving towards the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and thus, in fact, suspended any review of the sentences for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for the middle of October, as a sign of the importance given by the administration, diplomats said.
And three US envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new heavy messages or sentences from Washington.
The White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal debates under the condition of anonymity.
Their reports confirmed an external analyst close to the administration who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of Trump's justice, which is now very significant publicly available evidence.
Mr. Mueller reportedly also focused his investigation on whether Mr. Trump's campaign was secretly agreed with Russia as part of her attack on our elections.
If most people change in Congress, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just when he prepares to step up before the voters again, and perhaps in the end and in the jury of his equals.
There are many of these "if" and I don't want to suggest that the inevitable fall of Mr. Trum -- or those similar to him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will take.
In 1938, German officers were willing to strike against Hitler, only to face the West and support the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History turns around such points of inflexia, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or late.
The Americans are now facing several of these points of inflexia.
What are we gonna do if Mr. Trump fires deputy attorney, Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's fate of investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported that last year he secretly suggested a recording of the president and speculated on his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How do we respond if a recent FBI investigation on Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or confirmed by the Supreme Court despite persuasive accusations of sexual assault and unfair testimony?"
And above all, are we going to vote in medieval elections for the congress that Mr. Trump will call for responsibility?
If we fall on those tests, democracy will sleep a long winter dream.
But I don't believe we're going to fall for a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime he once cared in my ambassador's home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me to burn the sabbath candles on that table with a cowardly cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans from Rangers optimistic before facing Rapid from Vienna
Rapidu from Vienna hosted Rapid on Thursday, knowing that victory over Austrians, after an impressive remi in Spain against Villarrel early this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from the G European League Group.
The knee injury prevented Graham Dorrance's vein from appearing for the first time in the season to the 2-rime of 2 with Villarreal, but believes that the Rangers can use that result as a jumpboard for bigger things.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," said 31-year-old.
"We have entered the game by believing that we can achieve something and we have drawn the point.
Maybe we could eventually steal the game, but, in general, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better at the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good score in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I'm sure we can attack and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's some good feeling.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it; training is good.
Let's hope we can continue now, leave the season behind and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of the fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that research participants had a clear idea of what concern they wanted, few people discussed it with their family members.
About half of Nationwide Studies said they talked to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they do not take steps to start a conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president of Nationwide's life insurance.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Co-operate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to take care of it, for these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your consultant can also help you figure out how to pay those costs.
Your selection of financing for long-term care may include traditional insurance for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with a monetary value that will help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own wealth Ö as long as you have money.
Fix your legal documents: Basically prevent legal battles.
Engaging health representatives to determine a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals satisfy your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Also, consider giving the power to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of your accounts if you are not able to.
Remember the small details: Imagine your old parent finding a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Specify the details in the written plan to be ready.
"It's not only about finances, but also who are doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are the meds?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that plan in your hand."
A man shot several times from an Ilfracombe air rifle
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun when he was coming home after his night out.
The victim, in her 40s, was located in the area of Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 BST, as a "a random act".
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Concussions and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the indonesia city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and an increase in the number of deaths is expected.
Since communications have been discontinued, the aid officers were unable to obtain any information from the province of Donggale, areas north of Palua, near the epicenter of a 7.5 degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after a catastrophe.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi province, located at the end of the narrow cove on the western coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated his 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck him.
Dongala is a district extending more than 300 km of the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The district, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
The nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency.
In 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit the Western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The large earthquake on the Western coast of the Aceh province in the northern Sumatra on December 26th caused tsunamis that hit 14 countries, killing 226 000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, along the Sumatra coast.
2006: 6.8 degrees hit south of Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, causing tsunamis that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-degree earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The shallow earthquake hit the region of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic because he reminded people of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died from the crash of buildings.
2018: The major earthquakes hit the Lombok tourist island in Indonesia, where more than 500 people died, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for accusations of family violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for charges of assault.
Palin (29), from Vasilla, Aljaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting the application of family violence and resisting arrest, State Officer Alaska said in a report on Saturday.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is in custody of Mat-Su and retains its 500-dollar unsecured bond, the KTU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where the issue of plea on guilt has declared "innocent, of course", the network reported.
Palina is charged with three class A violations, which means he could be in prison for up to a year and punished with a fine of $25,000.
He was also accused of a class B violation, which is punished by one day of prison and a fine of $2,000.
It's not the first time Palin's filed criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in front of the Alaska V.A.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, disrupting the application of family violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state associated with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sara Palin criticised the veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds of killed
At least 384 people died after the earthquake hit by the Sulawesi Indonesian island on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been disconnected, and in the coming days the number of people are expected to increase.
The earthquake hit the immediate proximity of the central Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia Jakarta.
The social networks circulate videos that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at the beach festival in Palu when tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for a suspect for a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for a death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York, where eight people died rarely in 1953.
Saipov (30) reportedly used a truck to rent a store Home Depot to attack the bike track along the West Side road in the Lower Manhattan, where he cut the hills and bicycles on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "despitely" killed eight victims and deliberately committed severe physical injuries, according to the notification of the intention of seeking a death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these points lead to any death penalty, in accordance with the judicial document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury of Saipova hit 22-point indictments including eight murder and extortion charges, which federal prosecutors usually use in organised crime cases, and charges for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed it as "destructive, cruel and corrupt".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to families and friends Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucca," said in a report on the intention.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the southern county of New York last processed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but eventually sentenced to life in September 2009.
The death penalty was last in a federal case in New York, 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy for Soviet Union in the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 1953 on the electric chair.
According to the judicial documents, Saipov, a Native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance in days and months after the attack.
He told the investigators he felt good about what he did, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that after watching the ISIS video on his phone, he was inspired to carry out an attack, the indictment said.
He also asked to report the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded not guilty by 22 points of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision on seeking a death penalty, rather than accepting the recognition of life in prison without being able to release, will only extend the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defensive team has previously asked the prosecutor not to seek a death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged today to "mobilize the National Army" during a protest at the conservative conference.
The former leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party said politicians had to "still the pressure" of euroceptics Ö since one of the members of the Parliament Therese May suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
The conservative representative Peter Bone told the bureau in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have come out by now if Mr Farage had been Mr. Farage's secretary for Brexit.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faced in reconciliation of its deep-sized rows emphasizes the torians tending to stay joining a special protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister tries to maintain its compromise plan "Chequers" in the midst of the attack by supporters of Brexit, the EU supporter.
The allies insisted that it would continue to try to make an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction Ö and force Euroceptics and Laboratorians to choose between its packages and "haos".
Mr. Bone said at the Leave Means Leave campaign in Solihull that he wanted to "repel Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage had to get a title and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
A member of the Wellingborough Parliament added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must expel Chequers."
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We didn't fight in world wars to be subordinated.
We want to bring our own laws to our country."
Mr. Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and that they want to remain completely incorrect."
The conservative and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkins was also in the procession, saying to the press, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to people.
Plan Chequers is not popular in the wider public, opposition will not vote for him, is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who went out on the streets and chose us.
Please reject Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added: "The premiers keep their jobs when they fulfill their promises."
Farage told the crowds that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are willing to fail the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us people and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them 'that won't go away'."
In the message of enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the edge of the betrayal of Brexit, to feel pressure.
We are mobilizing the nation's army of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and we will not calm down until we become independent, self-administered, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, the supporters marched through Birmingham before they held a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
The crowd of activists waved with the transparency "Torians against Brexit" after launching the group this weekend.
The Laburist Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives for the security problems they suffered with the party application during the opening of the conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can have IT systems and all technology for the Canadian Plus Plan, for the undisturbed state of borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's all a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" running for president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "really consider running for president" after November elections.
Boston Globe reported that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday on direct association with citizens in West Massachusetts.
Warren, the common critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against the Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been in the centre of speculation for a while so that Trump could be confronted in 2020.
Meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
The participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren answered that it is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, which means a woman headed."
Arresting for the murder of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that she arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death outcome of the National University of Louisiana (LSU) of Wayde Sims, which took place on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police published information on the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11:00 A.M. at the press conference.
They released a video of the murder on Friday, asking for help identifying a man from the recording.
Sims, 20, was killed early Friday near the University of Southern campus.
"Wayde Sims gained a bullet in the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, at 247 sports.
Wayde got involved in defending his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was at the crime scene and owned a weapon and killed Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and detained in the county police of East Baton Rouge.
Sims, a third-year student high 198 cm, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in 10 first stages last season and average 17.4 minutes and scored 5.6 points and 2.9 jumps per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of World Championship after the order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order "will play a major role in the race".
From the initial position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two circles and urged Vettas to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton on traffic at the beginning, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered a boxing round later and went behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after the wheel action which made Ferrari driver unwillingly leave free interior in danger of lagging after a double move in defense of the third curve.
Max Verstappen came from the back row and was seven to the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he ran a large part of the race while relying on his tires to achieve a fast finish and override Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
Finally arrived in boxing in the 44th round, but he failed to speed up his pace in the remaining eight circles while Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It's been a hard day because Walteri's been doing a fantastic job all weekend and he's been a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a really remarkable job to make a formation final," Hamilton said.
That was a very bad body speech.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday because of her insistence that she did not release a letter to the public by Christine Blasey Ford, accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh for sexual abuse.
Addressing a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony to the Senate Justice Board, but commented on what happened in the Senate that people were "evil and nasty and dishonest".
"The only thing that can happen and the nice thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and unfair," he said.
"When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, they say: 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the information?
Remember her answer... did you release the document to the public - 'aa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let... no, we didn't," he added by imitating the senator.
Senator Feinstein sent a letter in July with details of Ford's claims against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September -- but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't let her story go public," Feinstein told the board, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it in secret, as she asked."
However, her denial did not come upon the approval of the president, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “Let me tell you something -- it was a very bad body speech.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body speech in my life."
Proceeding to defend candidates for the Supreme Court, whom three women have accused of sexual abuse, the president has suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power at all costs.
See evil, nasty, they don't care who they're going to hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control," the president quoted the Mediaite as saying.
Ellite League: Dundee Stars 5 ↑ 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for the defeat of Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday with a victory in Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5° 3.
In early minutes, the giants came to the advantages of two naked strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought homework to the equation, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back in the lead.
Francois Bouchard equaled for Dundee before two naked Lucas Lundvald Nielsen secured victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elita League season for Adam Keefe's team, who came from the background and beat Dundee with a score of 2 to 1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of two teams' seasons, and the Giants won the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening of the game arrived in the fourth minute, more specifically at 3:35, Kendall McFaul's Assistance, with David Rutherford's aid to double the leadership of the Beauvillier hit four minutes later.
In the rushed opening of the game, Sullivan returned to the home team at 13:10 a.m. before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finish the first third with the lead when he gave his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
Homemakers regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to the alignment of forces at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran together helped Nielsen for the first lead of Dundee at the end of the second third, and he took care of winning when his team had already been halfway to victory in the last third of the game.
Giants, who lost four of the last five matches, hosted the Milton Keynes teams in the next Friday game.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds of passengers on the plane avoid earthquake
The air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he died while ensuring a secure flight with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people died, and many were run missing after a major earthquake hit by Sulawesi Island on Friday and caused tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to affect the area, and many are trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his workplace at the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport, which drifted strongly.
He remained to ensure the safe flight of Batik Air on flight number 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was crashing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman of Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpano to Kalimantan to transfer him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Paluo.
"We are heartbreaking because of it," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of dead could reach thousands of people, and the State Agency for Disaster mitigation says access is limited to Dongali, Sigi and Boutong cities.
"It is believed that the number of killed continues to increase, since many bodies are still under ruins, and many could not even be reached," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, an agency spokesman said.
The waves that reached the height and up to six meters destroyed the Pala in which a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “She drove an ambulance every minute of the carriage of the bodies.
The government's lack of clean water.
Small stores are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Idonezian Red Cross is chasing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
The Indonesian President Joko Widododo arrived in Palace on Sunday and told the country’s army: “I ask all of you to work day and night in order to complete all evacuation assignments.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, with more than 550 people killed.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is running out after the plane crash in the lagoon
The airline that owns an aircraft that crashed into a Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one man is being run as missing, after it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the plane that sunk.
In his statement, Air Niugini said since Saturday afternoon I couldn't trace one of the passengers.
The airline said they cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and investigators in attempting to find a person concerned.
The airline did not immediately respond to the requests for additional information on the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Local ships helped save other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while he was trying to land at the island of Chuk.
Officials said on Friday seven people were transported to the hospital.
The airline announced that six passengers were held at the hospital on Saturday and that everyone was stable.
Which caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was flying very low.
"It's very good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and the others were able to break through the water that swinged to their waist to the exit in case of the danger of the plane that sunk.
He said the stewardess panicked and shouted, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby on repairing the port also helped to save using a boat to transport people to land before the plane sank in about 30 meters of water.
Air Niugini was not involved in the accidents of air carriers registered in the PNG in the last two decades.
Analyst exposes a time-view of the night where the woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended on Saturday a case in a retrial to a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst of the U.S. Ministry of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone records to agree a puzzle on the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victims, Jessica Chambers, the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data with several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, which was contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger quoted.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time when he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he lied because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The cell phone records suggested they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis, for some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contacts from her phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defence is scheduled to start the final word on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial to be sent to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's a bright hip-hop?
Hip-hop trio wants to cause a negative attitude toward the genre filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed singing group from Bristol argues that hip-hop music has been distant from its beginnings filled with political messages and by addressing social issues.
They want to return to their roots and hip-hop make it popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Commons are born again in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black girl?!
The New York nanny sues a couple for quitting after "rasist" message
The New York Nanny sues a couple for discriminatory resignation after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her "one more black girl".
A couple denys they're racist, comparing the charges with "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed displeasure when she found out she was the new babysitter of her children, Giselle Maurice, a black girl after her arrival in 2016.
"Noeee another nigger," Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in the message of her wife.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After she realized her mistake, Mrs Plasco-Flaxman found herself in a "appropriate" situation, and fired Mrs Maurice because, as she claims, their former nanny, who was already African-American, had a bad job, and that she had expected Philippines instead, New York Post quoted her as saying.
Mrs. Maurice got a paycheck for a day's work, and then she went home.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for a cancellation fee and seeks a 350-dollar compensation per day for the six-month period she was initially engaged to, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that I can't do such things," she told Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple replied to the claims that they were racist, saying that the ending of Maurice's employment was reasonable to do, because of fear that her insult would not be trusted afterwards.
"My wife didn't mean that she sent her in a message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," husband Joel Plasco told Post.
"But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife only received two months of maternity leave after birth and was in a "very difficult situation".
"You will sue someone in such a situation
"That is not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the court proceedings are still under way, the court of public opinion quickly condemned a couple on social networks, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared that the readers would not match the bear that speaks, revealed in a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is hard before publishing to put herself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time.
It is very fun what we now know about Paddington's huge success."
Saying that her father, who worked as BBC's cameraman before the little woven bear inspired him to write a child's book, would be optimistic if his work was rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, described as "very important member of the family", she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man and was not a boaster," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it all felt like a child's achievement: you are proud of him even though none of it is actually your work.
I think Paddington's success was viewed that way.
While it was about his work and his imagination, he always attributed credit only to Paddington."
My daughter was dying, and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was immediately transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Hood called regularly to say it was really bad and to believe that he would not get away," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then Nad invited me to tell me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I must say goodbye to her.
Which I've done.
I said, "Tashi, baby, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
Medicines that doctors gave her to keep her heart rate slowly lost effect and abandoned her body system.
She died just before boarding, and then it all went off.
I just had to sit and wait knowing what would happen next.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything inside of me."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in grief then for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane along with other passengers -- who were unaware of the temptation she was going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I lowered my head, and tears dried down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on my flight, I felt a strong feeling of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Woman messages in mourning on the bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their loved ones for suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same thing.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I feel every day," she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a cook with a contagious smile awaited by a brilliant career.
"They all remembered him by his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy."
However, before his death, he left the job because he was in "really dark condition".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11, found his brother after taking his life.
Mrs Davis said: “I constantly worry that this will have a negative effect. ”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with the cards "to make people know there's someone you can go and talk to, even if she's a friend.
Don't sit in silence you need to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a long-term friend of Mrs Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she was 15 years old, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas he was at the bottom when the children opened their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or want anything else."
She said that his death was a major trauma to them, but that they had to cope with it: “It all leaves a great cavity in the family.
He's taking us away.
But we will continue and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on the end while the FBI begins the investigation.
"I thought maybe we could enter a little unity if we could really get something like what he was looking for a time and scope limited investigation," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the board was "degrading" in the midst of a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigation?
Their unwillingness was motivated by choosing the moment.
Mediterranean elections will arrive in only five weeks, on November 6th, if Republicans are expected to fail well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush repeatedly invited the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the feds do their report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to break with a decisive voice and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
The number of escapes from North Korea falls under Kim's lead
The number of refugees from North to South Korea fell after Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the South Korean legislator said.
Calling on the United South Alliance Ministry data, Park Byeong-seug said 1127 escaped last year compared to 2706 during 2011.
Mr. Park said that key factors are stricter control at the border crossing between North Korea and China and more charges that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The large majority of North refugees eventually received South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run across China, which has the longest line with North Korea and is easier to cross than a highly protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between two Koreans.
China is viewed as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South have improved significantly in the past months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled talks on denuclearisation.
This followed a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work in a broader way to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, however, Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean Foreign Minister, blamed US sanctions that they have not made any progress since.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and there is no reason that under such circumstances we are first to be disarmed," Mr. Ri said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unable to serve in Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called candidate for Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't think of a woman, if she ever behaved like that, to call herself "hysterical," Pelosi described her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the claims that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost shouting and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling him "grotesque and coordinated blackmail" organised by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not participate in the work of the Supreme Court, because he demonstrated that he had prejudices against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Asked whether he would try to revoke Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats get most in the House of Representatives, Pelosi rebuked.
"I'll say the following: if he's not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not capable not only of being in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he's now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Federal Appeal Court in the District of Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a Democratic girl, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh's decisions against the Act of Accession Care or the Act of abortion of the Protestology in Roe Process against Wade, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings for confirmation, Kavanaugh went around questions about whether to amend some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"It is not the time for hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, "Isn't that wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Acknowledged criticism, anger that has been gathered for months and years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual." What do you think?"
She continued: “I was deeply helped by a woman who once was a CEO and who said that she cried when she got angry, but developed the technique that, when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to said: ‘ You might think I am sad because I am crying.
I'm angry."
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger, partly because they're basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs, in the office where men were dominated, is how, once when I cried because of an unspeakable anger, an older woman, who was always a little afraid of me, drove me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be pleased because they'll think they've hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught in an alien affair on the Monkey Business ship and retired from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason why she would not consider the idea of running for the president.
"It was not a well-designed decision," she told me through laughter 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and certainly they didn't need another.
Someone called them "Sneezes and seven dwarfs."
Since the campaign had already gone a long way, she was behind the fund collection, and she pledged not to enter the race if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of the supporters, who gave the men a thousand dollars, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" she wondered.
While she said that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so obsessed with emotions of gratitude to people who supported her, frustration over a system that made it difficult to collect money and target the voters instead of the delegates, and with anger over sexism, that her throat was overwhelmed.
"You would think that I had experienced a nervous breakdown," Mrs Schroeder recalled the media reaction to her.
"You would think Kleenex is my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they would put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How can the trade war between the United States and China be good for Beijing?
The beginning of the US-China trade war has echoed loudly and, while the battle is far from the end, the separation between countries can be useful to Beijing in the long term, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US president, fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation in this week has emerged with new customs that have affected the products worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), actually taxing half of all the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing took some kind of return, and recently a customs rate was introduced from five to ten percent to 60 billion dollars of US goods.
China has promised that the United States will respond by impact, and the second largest world economy will certainly not surrender soon.
The retreat of Washington could be achieved by describing demands, but the public submission of the United States would be too uncomfortable for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well his cards, the pressures of the US trade war can provide positive support for China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a fast political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for the launch of economic stremling in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed," said Abigail Grace, a scientific co-worker for strategic deliberation that focused on Asia in the New American Security Centre.
Syria "read" to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says she is willing to return refugees voluntarily and appeals to help restore the country that has destroyed a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's conditions are improving.
"The situation in the field is more stable and safer today thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks to establish a normal situation.
All the conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5,5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the 2011 war.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said Syrian regime would benefit from helping restore the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept parole assistance or assistance from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe won Ryder Cup in Paris
The team of Europe won the Ryder Cup in 2018, winning the US team with the final score of 16,5 ↑ 10,5 on the Le Golf National field near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown while the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached 14,5 points to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was tortured during almost the entire tournament, sent a ball into the water during the first blow, leaving a match to Francescu Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shaved in all rounds and became one of the four players who ever reached 5-0-0 since the 1979 tournament started this format.
The American of Jordan Spieth threw Thorbjorn Olesen out of Denmark, the lowest ranked European team player, with 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 of the Englishman Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran eight Ryder purchases, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became European with the highest victory in the tournament with 25,5 points in his career.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't stop tears today.
The year was heavy.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that I won the bowl again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy to help," Garcia said, full of emotions after the European victory.
He transmits a torch to his countryman John Ram who beat the legendary American golfer, Tiger Woods, a result of 2 & 1 in individual games on Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride for winning Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
The unusual statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 headlines, and is right behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team fought all weekend to find a way out, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top golf during the whole tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, American captain Jim Furyk said: “I am proud of these guys, they fought. ”
In certain moments, we have been resisting Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking off Thomas' hat.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to get over it, work with the PGA of America and our board of Ryder Cup, so we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off of people.
