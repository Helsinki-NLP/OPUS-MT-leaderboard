It's clear he's home.
It's Friday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark out there.
It's getting dark outside.

It's too late for you.
It's true that I'm a strict teacher.

It has become very difficult for me to walk very far.
It's been years since we last met.
It's been a while since I told you that I love you.
