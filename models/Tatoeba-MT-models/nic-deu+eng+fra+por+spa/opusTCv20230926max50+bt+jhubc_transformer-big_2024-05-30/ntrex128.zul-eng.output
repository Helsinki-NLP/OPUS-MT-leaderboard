The Welsh AMs are worried that they will "show"
They ask themselves to answer some of the AM's views on changing the way they are called the MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This is the result of a change in the Welsh parliamentary system.
All political parties in the world are afraid that this would be a laugh.
Another Labour AM member said they were afraid of the same noise as Twp and Pwp.
For students outside of Wales: Welsh twp means stupidity and pwp means the way.
The Plaid AM group said it was just a group of happy people and gave them other names to choose from.
The Welsh Conservative Party said that as a group they are willing to accept a change of name but realized that the MWP is very close to being called a nuisance.
The Welsh logo W is similar to the U logo in Yorkshire England.
The Commission's best-selling Amendment legislation states: "The decision to cancel these complaints will be a matter which will be held by the members of the legislature."
The Wales State Act 2017 gave the Welsh organization the right to change their name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public survey with ideas, which received considerable support for the reform of the Welsh parliament.
In the case of the AMs, the commission established the WMP, and the public's decision showed a reliability on the MWP.
The AMs have also posted ideas with them, but the coalition will be a problem for Elin Jones, who is responsible for the implementation of the change legislation over the coming weeks.
Regulations will include the changes in the processing of the contract, including the amendments of the amendment and the process of the committee.
The AM will have the final word on the subject of which they will be called if legally discussed.
The Macedonians vote in the election to change their country's name.
The voters will vote on Sunday to decide if they will change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This is an open election that comes after attempting to resolve the continent that took decades on the issue of a neighboring Greek country with its Macedonian county.
Athens has long defended itself against the fact that its country's top-of-the-country neighbors only have to take part in their country, while it is still against Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov has confirmed the change in the name of the referendum.
However, those who are confronted with a change of name counting Prime Minister Zoran Zaev consider this as something to be done to become members of the EU and NATO.
It is located in Bells of St Martins with the difficulties faced by the Harlem congregations.
"Historically, the adults with whom I have signed said there was a church and a place to put an end to all roads," Mr. Adams said.
"Today, there's no recording".
He said the deterioration of the debris is understandable.
"People have been involved in a variety of ways today," he said.
"Guides are no longer useful in places where they were gathered every day."
Congregations are deeply concerned because the money received by the authorities by selling the goods of the congregations will not last long and people will seem to have done nothing.
He also said that the churches would be able to provide accommodations for people who would not be able to help the councillor of the congregations.
The majority of people who buy rooms for living in white people," he continued, "they will do so soon to reach the closure of these congregations legally because they are less likely to be members of the church".
The two churches were built by white members before Harlem became the black town of the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and became St Martins ten years later.
The first white congregation was formed in the 1930’s.
A congregation of black members who served in the nearby building took over the building.
St Martins was taken over by a black community named after Death John Howard Johnson, who led the protest against the 125th street traders who were struggling to improve black people.
The 1939 fire extinguisher left the church house, but while members of the Church of the Deceased Johnson’s congregation made repairs, they began to build a cathedral.
David Johnson, the son of Johnson, once again became the successor of the Dead. Johnsonsn called it the iron of the poor.
The player who played the metals in July said "human value" and "a symbol of history that can be eliminated".
Michigan University's Tiffany Ng said for the first time in the world the metal was hit by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to play at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
St. Martins' Church did not forget your post, Mr. Merriweather said.
A few months ago at St Martins was a scary church and a convent, some of the leaders of the congregation were arrested.
A non-profit congregation leaders wrote to the board of directors for complaints that they did not want to cover the costs of the builders and contractors to see them as a vestry without entering into the employment of those contractors or builders.
Some members of the congregation cried out in public for failing.
A 13-year-old girl was born in Carlifornia.
A 13-year-old boy is said to have injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday to hunt lobster ealifornia on the day of opening a lobster attack.
The event took place at 7 in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encitas.

Giles has warned that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area but most are not treated as dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans include them in the UK's beauty market
Sainsbury will compete with Bots, Superdrug and Debenhams for its distinctive stores of beauty and professional help.
As part of their attempts to enter a 2.8bn-based beauty market, it is one of the fastest growing markets in that fashion and household items seem to flow backwards. Large shopping malls will begin their first 11 stores throughout the country and will be exported across the country as a valid transitor.
Financial support comes after marketers are looking for ways to use open spaces to decrease the sales of household items.
Sainsbury says it will repeat their products to reach 3000 and install the products of Revlon Essie Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The products that have already been available to your Lorela Maybeline and Burt's bees will find a wide range of spaces and places that have their particular ads.
The market will also re-extract facial masks so that the majority of these products have their own fruits and fruits only as much as the majority of small consumers want this.
In addition, the Fregrance shop retailer will receive water with a bottle of water in the 2 stores that were first opened in the Croydon mine and London last week and the second one that opened in Solly Oak in Birmingham with a snack.
Shopping and shopping in nearby stores is one of the main reasons why markets have done so much to attract customers.
Sainsbury's chairman Mike Coupe said they will mainly look at the door of market stores to try to counter Aldi and Lidl figures and other services and food shortages.
Sainsbury has installed Argos in hundreds of stores that also included Habitats that bought them two years ago, which has helped increase the purchase of their food and profits.
The past efforts in the market to revive beauty and pharmaceutical products have not been successful.
Sainsbury also attempted to join Boots in the early 2000s and also erupted after not realizing how the benefits of pharmaceuticals would be distributed in its markets.
This new method comes after they sold their 281 stores at Celesio owner of Lloyds pharmacy 125m over the past three years.
Lloyds will also help by inserting self-esteem such as La Roche Posay and Vichy.
"We've changed the way our packages look good to our customers," said business manager Paul Mills.
We also have advocates for professionals who are close to providing customer support.
"A wide variety of products are designed to meet all the demands, and our shops place them on the line saying that we are now entering all the available solutions to fix the old way of buying."
Peter Jones heard after Holly Willoughby's death in a <0x24>11 million contract.
This comes after Holly Willoughby quit his 11 million-million-year-old business deal to care for other businesses with Marks and Spencer and TV.
Willoughby no longer has time to deal with domestic issues.
Both businesses are similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop product.
In the same way, the 37-year-old has announced that he's gone on Instagram.
That's why Peter jones of Dragons Den is red as he focuses on his new businesses with ITV and Marks and Spencer.
The source says she was hired by a televised woman's televised beliefs that on Tuesday their head office in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new businesses were estimated at 1.5 million - will make her feel that she has had enough time to deal with Truly's needs.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, which was considered to be reversing its 11 million-million-dollar share.
Jones has just gone to some of his restrooms when Willoughby, 37, announced his departure on Instagram.
The source says: It was definitely one of the most important things in Holly.
This was his future that would keep him in the years to come.
His resignation allows everyone to stay in touch with him.
No one believed what happened on Tuesday had come to the close of the shopping mall.
"In Marlow HQ locations are available for sale".
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the news, the number of British celebrity figures, would not leave the money invested in clothing stores and roads, which could lead to the suffering of sales.
This can mean the end of long-term friendships.
Willoughby's mother of three children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, was ten years old with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
In 2016, Truly joined Willoughby and Capp, 52, who joined them as a joke in March.
The couple shared holidays, and Jones accounted for 40 percent of Baldwin’s program.
Willoughby will be an M<0x26>S advisor and will close Ann McPartin's space as a popular lead television program.
Last night, a source of closeness with Jones was found, "We can't say anything about his story."

He has made some complaints about the unfortunate discovery of the media even about his belief in the North Korean leader.
Why does Trump have to pay so much for it?
Trump says he has been "subscribed" in his voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
Kim has noticed that Kim is still eager to meet him for a second time in Singapore in June as he announces Trump as an important step in the North Korean Denuclearization.
However, the preparations for Denuclearization have been devastating.
More than three months after June in Singapore, where Ri Yong of North Korea told the U.N. on Saturday that North doesn't see "thing that could unite" with the U.S. in the first attempt to put the weapons underground.
On the contrary, he noted that the U.S. continues to progress.
Trump has taken a second look at the talk.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Most people would die.
Now we have a good relationship with them."
He says his efforts to strengthen his friendship with Kim have resulted in analysis of bombings, as well as for the victims who were forced to return home.
He has also defended his popularity about Kim.
"It's easy for the authorities, instead of having 10,000 people outside the court's presence, to have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing directly to the crowd standing in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami as well as the island's tsunami, killed a hundred.
Shortly after the earthquake in Lambok, for example, non-national organizations were told that they were no longer needed.
Even if a 10 percent increase in the population of Lambok has been changed, no natural disasters have been reported.
"In many cases, in addition, they made it clear that they were looking for help from other countries, so it's more of aggressive," M.S. Submung said.
While helping children build a group that would travel in the area of Papua New Guinea, it's unclear that travellers can't do it on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, who represented disaster victims, has conducted an investigation into Palu's situation in order to see if I had allowed other countries to help me with medical treatment.
Due to the ongoing development of the earth, the country is still not ready to face the damage caused by nature.
In the past, there was a tsunami in Aceh, which was not seen on the beach.
The decrease of anger that will distract others from the tsunami in Palu, whether or not they would do something, is like adding a hand to the death of the soul.
In time, travelling through the forests of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are a common cause of confusion.
The hospital boat is set in Lambok to help organize the victim during the earthquake in Palu, but it takes three days.
President Joko Widododo has made the amendments of the invasion into his election campaign, spending a lot of money on road construction and railway construction.
Joko and his team are ready for next year's election.
Mr. Joko is faced with a difficult situation in Indonesia, where many Muslims find it difficult to change their minds.
More than 10,000 homicides have been evacuated from their homes as Christians and Muslims who will be created to fight on the streets.

Brian O'Hagan says: "The investigation is still in the first steps we will help those who have seen and heard in John's Birkenhead trail.

The police spokesman agreed to have found a body in his home in Birkenhead.
The youngest and the youngest of the young people today are asking a question about the subject.
The investigation is still underway when I called the police to transfer information to the police.
A taxi driver living in Grayso Mews was trying to get back to the kitchen when police informed him that no one was allowed in the building.
It's just a matter of saying that it's going to happen.
Residents were asked to leave for a few hours and were allowed to enter.
One of the police officers reported to the man that the building was being rebuilt.
A woman came out of the room.

A photo of Cromwell's cabinet becomes a memorial to the back.
This has caused many of the inhabitants of England to suffer because of their traditions and beliefs.
Cromwell, however, describes Mr Crick's view as stupid and wants to re-write history.
John Godsmith, who represented Cromwell Society, said: "It's amazing to hear about the removal of the image outside of the parliament.
The military did not receive a message from Cromwell.
Cromwell would probably be a good advocate for Thomas, who lived in the past.
Mrs. William Hmao, who represented Cromwell in the 19th Century, held by the team, believes that his memory could be a good thing.
Mr. Goldsmith told the telegraph on a weekly basis "Cromwell is highly recommended, probably something to his memory.
Regardless of where there is a conflict in history.
In the 17th century he had transformed the nation, and Cromwell has come to the forefront as an alien who can separate and rebuild the development of our country.
The results he receives as a protector should also be remembered.

The farmer was attacked and killed in the Southwest China market, according to media reports.
The man, the Yuan vaccine was found dead, full of blood in the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou in southern China on a weekly basis.
The farmer is ready to launch on 30 May 2005 in <0x58>inning in Qinghai, China.
He has visited his cousin, who lives in Yunnan in the same province on Wednesday to sell him 15 chickens on the market.
On the next day in the morning, her cousin is found dead, near the door.
He says that the bee was a large man with blood in his mouth.
After a detailed examination, make sure that the 550 pounds [550 kg] of beer was the farmer’s food.
"My cousin's leg was bloody," said the cousin, calling his "WU," said the Guiyang evening news.
Yuan's cameras enter the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed the pigs.
Her body was recovered an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not the place of Yuan or his cousin.
The manager told reporters that the bullet was banned from harming anyone, while the police were closing the evidence.

Rosa's remains will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest of the United States
According to the weather estimates, Rosa's shiny rosa will become exhausted when we go to the dry waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rose is going to come.
Rosa has an air speed of 85 mph, each storm, from 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to visit the North on Sunday.
Currently, the ship begins to change the situation in the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the west of the U.S. As Rosa approaches the island of Baja California on Monday the storm will begin to strengthen the Northern Territories between the West.
Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to ten inches in some places in Mexico on Monday.
Therefore, the next days the rain will meet with the ark and build strong and wide rains in the West.
Located in nearby areas, rainfall recorded in the inch will result in dangerous floods, doll worship, and even the drought of land.
TropicUmswakama will make the rainfall of two to three inches per hour accurately, especially in the Southern areas of Nevada and Arizona.
Rain rates ranging from two to four inches are expected in the Southwest, especially most of them in Arizona.
Flooded floods are expected to adapt to a rapidly deteriorating condition due to the natural drought of rain.
It would be unwise to open a sick business because it would be raining.
Strong rains can cause torrents that seem like the sun to rise, causing a wind turbine in nearby areas to move on with dust.
The future ships will bring heavy rainfall to areas close to Southern California and the coast.
Rain rates in half of the inch can cause small amounts of damage to the dots and roads.
This will be the first rain in the region as it rains.
Some dramatic rains will begin to draw closer to Arizona on Sunday and Monday morning, before the rains are rising on Mondays and Tuesdays.
The rains will spread in four rooms on Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, we will see the temperatures in the U.S. as the Arctic will slow down, but Tropics will be warm.
This usually results in a short-term change in temperatures.
There is a good example of hazardous changes in temperatures in central areas of the U.S. week.
There are 20-degree differences at temperature levels in Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next few days, the temperature will increase.
Between the U.S. and the East are expected to appear early in October and the temperature of the 80s from the South to the north.
New York City is expected to reach a height of 80 degrees on Tuesday, which means that it is more than 10 degrees common.
Our environmental analysts have indicated that the rates will rise in the eastern regions.
More than 20 million people are investigating Brett Kavanaugh's case
More than 20 million people who watched evidence were selected for a concert by Brett Kavanaugh and a woman who accused him of sexual harassment in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Currently, politics continues, even though they have been interfered in their regular programs due to unexpected changes on Friday in the last minute: the Arizona Sen.U Jeff Flake's FBI will begin trial.
Ford told the jury that he was very sure that Kavanaugh tried to miss him and pull his shoes off the top of his school.
Kavanaugh, witness to the court, and she is fully convinced that nothing happened.
According to Nielsen's report, more than 20.4 million people have seen it.
The report comes from a company with other viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figure out some numbers that are not immediately available on the PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is often faced with a challenge in counting the number of viewers in their offices.
To show them how they see, the number of people say they are equal to those who watch football or have never played football.
The Fox News Channel, with a viewing director that harvests Kavanaugh, has led to allowing all stations to have a rating of 5.69 million viewers every day, according to Nielsen.
The ABC is second place with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS also has a 3.1 million, the NBC also has a 2.94 million, MSNBC has a 2.89 million and the CNN has 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The curiosity of knowledge continues to rise after the case.
Flake was seen red on the drama on Friday.
After a statement about Kavanaugh's election, he was arrested on CNN's and CBS cameras on Friday in the afternoon when he was called up to the crowd while attempting to ride a train that would bring him before the judge.
When it was broadcast live by the CNN station, he stopped staring at the ground for a short time being stunned.
"You're here in front of me," another woman said.
Do you think you're right in the world?
He said, "If most women are weak, they are weak."
He said his office had issued a statement and said, before the charge had run, that he had much to say before the court.
They use the channel cords to spread the case, and the time has come for the judge to vote for Kavanaugh's cancellation.
But Flake will only do that if he realizes that the FBI is looking at all the sides of the issue next week, which has long been sought by many.
Flake has changed his friend's mind during a conversation with his friend, Democrat Sen. Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Mr. Blake, he decided to make a decision.
Flake's choice had a strong Flake Decision, as residents did not vote for Kavanaugh without the end of the investigation.
President Trump has opened a FBI investigation to find out what was against Kavanaugh.

Police have been detained by Catalan residents before the election.
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after a demonstration against the police, as a result.
A group of people have started racing around the edges and dry paints, full of meat.
If there was violence in the morning, police have used tons of balloons to protest.
A few hours later, a group that boasts that "no peace will be forgotten" looked directly at the authorities saying, "live forever in Spain."
Fourteen people have been taken care of after the announcement, according to the local paper.
The situation is becoming more and more solid in the region than once a year after 9 October, the separation of the Catalans has been enjoyed.
Electoral candidates have chosen to be independent, but that does not agree with the votes at the time of the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured after police tried to stop the vote.
Some people choose not to sleep at night to make a show.
The show continued to take place, but they did it even harder.
Narciss Termes, 68, says his carrier was no longer confident about Catalonia's independence.
"We were happy last year.
"I've seen my parents cry because they can't vote, but we've got it," he said.
Despite the important management of the regional elections in the last December in Catalan, the teams must be concerned about the best managers either the role of arbitration or the role of arbitration and ensuring that they are independent.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old recorder at a time rather than recording a phone, said that this was the reason for the damage.
"It's going to be hard," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine incarcerated last year, was announced to be voted in the European Parliament next year.

The winner of Liverpool's 1-0 game against Rangers
Dolly Mega's first article on Livingston
Livingston's newly promoted Ranger by Steven Gerrard has admitted his second division after 18 games as a coach for the Ibrox team.
Manga's article became a contrast as Gary Holt's group grew up in a row, the ibbernian fell asleep in a dual bed.
Gerrard's team has not won the Premiership in this season and will meet with the Hearts on the screen, leaving them for no more than two points on Saturday.
Before this, Rangers received the Rapid Vienna in the Europa League for the fourth time.
Livingston is currently not divided into 6 games, as coach Holt has continued to be separated since he closed the Kenny Miller stage last month.
Liverpool is a great opportunity to travel with tourists.
The Holt team needs to be much more advanced before they make, their understanding has caused a lot of Rangers problem.
Scott Robinson had a chance but failed to score a goal score, while Allan Lithgow played for Craig Halkett.
The family had been forced to let Ranger play in front of them, for they knew that they could not beat themselves with a piece of paper.
It was also the most important way to get out of it.
The Rangers made a free-kick at Livingston and found the opening of the album, Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined Menga, affecting the ball and posting the middle point of the box.
At the time, Rangers held the game but did not pass because the killer was behind and Liam Kelly's independence,
The season went on in the second round, or Alfredo Moralese tried to get Kelly to play the ball.
Scott Pittman is banned from the footage of Rangers by Allan McGregor and Lithgow leaving the ball in one of Livingston's playgrounds.
The crosses come in a sequence of the Livingston box but it was removed, there were charges of trying the penitentiary – after which Halkett played badly for Glenn Middleton, and broke out a new wild-spot was all destroyed.
Livingston-Hello-Hello
Alasdair Lamont BBC Scotland and Tony Macaroni Arena
It's a good game and the results in Liverpool.
As a result, they're going to go beyond what was expected of them.
Their way of playing and their own way hasn't changed since they returned to the club, but we have to commend Holt in the way he cooked the team to support his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, his wall was strong, while Menga kept Conn or Golden and Joe Worroll close to the rest of the game.
Rangers were screwed up, but they weren't.
Even if they did well under Gerrard, they died by keeping those standards.

Police have threatened security situations as it prevented the majority of 25,000 people to stand in front of a museum, but most of them are fans close to seeing their president.
Centuries of tourists who do not accompany Erdogan - most of them are in the drought - and they want us their words to be heard, violating Erdogan's law and the German government now accept instruction.
This publication shows the difference between views of tourists we see as a hero in the German Turks and as a challenge to others.

It's not unusual for a swarm to attack Arizona, but that's what will happen at the beginning of the week next week as the power of Hurricane Rosa continues to approach the desert in the southwest, bringing flooding risks.
The skyscrapers warn you to watch floods on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona to the south and eastern Nevada, southeastern Carlifornia and Utah, to count the cities in Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Las Vegas.

In some rural areas southwest, the middle of the Rockies and the Great Basin is expected to reach about 1 to 2 inches [1 to 2 cm], full-five inches [4 cm] if possible.
With those accidents, Rosa may be a blessing as part of the drought strikes.
Even if the floods are too dangerous, one will be rewarded because the southwest is hit by a drought.

Trump says Kavanaugh is “depressed, cruel, and hating” the Democratic Party
"Judge Kavanaugh's vote has voted to remove the most unfortunate and offensive strategies in the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been "stressed, angry" the Democratic Party throughout his promotional process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, in opposition to the violence from Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when she was young.
Ford has also confirmed his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people are brave and courageous" of Kavanaugh on the same day.

Hundreds were killed in earthquakes, tsunami, and the number grew
At least 384 people were killed, many were flooded by huge waves during the bombing of the bridges, while the earth and tsunami crashed into the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to officials on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on the beach in the city of Paul on Friday when the 18-foot [18 m] high winds were attacked in the valley at nine o’clock, killing many of them and destroying anything along the way.
Tsunami followed a 7.5-inch earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged on Thursday, people were doing their jobs on the beach and did not hurry and become victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugworo, Indonesian spokesman, in an attack on BNPB.
"Tsunami didn't come alone, drove cars, doors, houses, hit everything on the ground," said Nughoro, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the world.
Some people fled to the forests to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 17,700 people were transported to 24 stations in Palu.
Photographs taken from the disaster center showed many buildings and shops that collapsed, bridges crashed and destroyed along with a steam-covered bridge.
The effort continues to move the city around the coast all Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was known in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) says that a report of the power output of a woman's experiment on Friday was about 200 percent of the atomic bombing power that crossed Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, sitting at the end of the long, smaller half, may increase the size of the tsunami, they say.
Nugrowo described the damages such as "great" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels fell.
Members of the victims were found closing under the crackdown, he said, putting 540 people to death and 29 dead.
Nuggoro noted that those who were injured and damaged may be larger than 300 miles [300 km] north of Palu, a place called Donggala, near the quake epicenter.
The "consciousness of knowledge" comes from Donggala, says Nughero.
There are over 300,000 people living there," said Red Cross in a statement, adding that its employees and volunteers go to affected areas.
It is said, "It's a lot worse than this."
On Saturday, the jury was widely criticized for not saying that the tsunami had invaded Palu, although authorities say that the water had arrived at the time of the warning.
A video shared in the social community a man under the building may sound unwise warning about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, the water bridge in the sea, which removes buildings and cars.
Reuters were unable to prove the authenticity of the video.
Earthquakes and tsunami caused the end of electricity and communication in Paula that made it difficult for managers to manage their efforts to help.
Soldiers have begun shipping cargo from Jakarta and other cities, says authorities, but survivors need food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is open only for relief efforts and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widododo is scheduled to visit the Palu Restaurants on Sunday.
The Indonesian Tsunami Toll has grown to more than 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision workers from Donggala have been living in a safe place in Palu, where workers live in the rental areas built in their office, transmitting drugs along the way, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me to see a lot of homes," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as relief teams began to explode in aid metals, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were forbidden to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, money, goods, goods and workers from abroad can begin to emerge if the disaster site is referred to as a national disaster site.
That is not possible.
"It's only a state disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"If the government says, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' we can allow help from other countries but it is not currently possible."
As the two nights fall to Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those who have lost hope that loved ones will be a wonder of the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young man was released from the scene.
On Sunday, nurses released a woman who had been confined under a rubber for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, an Indonesian disabled coach, coached two disabled people who lost in Asian sports, which were reunited earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the detainees in the Roa Roa hotel, said Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
He said: "As an elder in the area of disabilities, I have compassion for my load.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed in the middle of the paragliding community, he was sending WhatsApp messages to the Palu competition, which became part of the beach militia.
His messages, however, have led to a single symptom, rather than looking at the blue cords.
"I think that means that the messages are not sent," he said.

Wesley: It changed her name.
Kanye West has changed her name - yes.
In a statement on Twitter, he wrote: "It's known as the same one."
West, 41, was named after the game for a time and used a moniker as the theme of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before his appearance on Saturday night, when it is expected to start his new album Yandhi.
Ariana Grande has been featured on the show with "for reasons of his spirit," the founder of the show said.
As well as the introduction of his current technological name, West says earlier that the name has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe that 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'," West says at the beginning of the year, referring to his album and radio title Big Boy.
"I'm the one, I'm the one.
It came from Kanye, which means that we are the only one, to Him alone - merely to show just what is good, bad, confusing, all of us.
Album is more than just a sign of who we are.
He is one of the most famous writers to change their name.

The former member of the West, JAY-Z, has done or without meetings and articles.
Mexicans don't want to fight against civilians
Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged that he will not use the military against civilians as the country approaches the 50 years of blood attack against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the Plateloco Plaza that "Never use military force to suppress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, police arrested about 300 people at the time when the Leftist student movement was centered around Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly services to those who are studying and opening many public universities for free.
He says that unemployment and lack of opportunities to learn can lead to crime.
The U.S. must increase the support of A.I.
Since China is more active in I.A., the U.S. should double the number of researchers in the field, according to investor and AI, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Protesters from the various sides of the U.S. government have made a declaration in the AI, just as the entire U.S. does not have a scheduled AI goal.
Meanwhile, China launched its own program last year: aiming to launch the AI in 2030.
"The research budget for AI will be a good start, just as all other countries are far away after the U.S., and we want to achieve the next success in AI," Lee said.
Conflicts and financial support can reverse the potential for a major achievement of the AI in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, his book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director of Sinovation Ventures, which has been replaced by one of the most outstanding companies in AI in China, Face <0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University worked for the AI's newest AI player of the American Othello, and later became director of Microsoft Research and President of the Google branch of China.
Lee agreed to the U.S. technological competence as the U.S. High Commissioner for Robotics Challenge and asked when the next will be, to help us see the following industries.
Researchers in the U.S. usually have to work hard to overcome government assets, says Lee.
"It's not China that removes educational leaders; it's companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have used universities to operate on AI over the years.
Lee said changes in migration policy could also help the U.S. to strengthen their AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be automatically made to PhDs on the AI," he said.

The Macedonians voted to change the name of the country or not.
The Macedonians voted on Sunday to cover the country's name as "the Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a conflict with Greece's national unity of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which calls Macedonia and its province, continues to say that its neighbors in the north of the road are looking for their place and want to enter the NATO and the EU.
Both governments make a treaty with a reference name, but some say that changing the name means to look down on the traditions of most Macedonians of these Slavic people.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote again to make sure that 50<0x25> of the votes will arrive until the election is official.
The question on the vote page reads: "You agree with the membership of the NATO and the EU by the Greek Agreement."
They disagree with the name change, quoted Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, saying it's what you're paying for by accepting such stakes as the EU and Nato in Macedonia, some countries that emerge in the Yugoslavia.
"I'm here to vote for the rest of our country, so that the Macedonian youths will live well under the European Union's umbrella because it describes all our survival," Olivera Georgyevska, 79, said in Scopje.
Regardless of the legal requirements, the members of the legislature have said that the decision will be accepted.
The change will require two parts of the panel to eat a meeting in the parliament.
The National Election Commission says there were no reports of inconsistencies at 1 p.m.
However, it was still 16 percent, with 34 percent of the previous parliamentary votes in 2016, while 66 percent of voters signed their votes.
"I have gone to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a vote in the city, Skopje.
The Macedonian PM Zoran Zaev, his wife, and son Dushko voted for a referendum in Macedonia by changing the country's name that would open the way to join the NATO and the European Union in Strumuca, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
Before parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, repaired the line and sat in front of the tents by those who would resist the referendum.
"We would be NATO and the EU, but we want to join the rankings, not the door of service," Kavadarkov said.
"We're a poor country, but we're rich.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonians, we can convert others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says the NATO membership will bring the funding needed in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that 80 percent of our citizens will join the EU and NATO," Zaev said after signing a vote.
He said "yes" the results of the "proof of our future."
A poll was published on Monday at the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters had participated – under expectation.
One poll, hosted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found 57<0x25> of respondents who planned to vote on Sunday.
About 70 percent of the voters say yes.
In order to achieve a success rate of 50<0x25> and a single vote.
The failure of a referendum will reveal a major pro-Western government problem this took a long time in May last year.

Trump is located in West Virginia
The president summed up his speech in a circumstance around his choice of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court where he emphasized the importance of the departure of Republicans to the internal election and leadership.
"We've done everything we can do in November.
Five weeks before the most important decision in our lives.
"This is one of the biggest, most importantly - I'm not running but you can say I'm running so I'm full of fighters," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this corrupt, degrading group of Democrats, that's what you see right now.
And they are determined to return to strength in any way they can find it, just look at it, and get rid of it.
They don't care about who they are, and that anyone who has the right to rule will have power, that's what they want to control and power, we don't give it to them."
Democrats, according to him, are in the campaign for "rebellion and disruption."
"And when you look at the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "to be united, to be cruel, and untrue."
He then referred to the Senate Legislative Committee called Sen. Dianne Feinstein of the Democrat by name, which brought him water to the crowd.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did he break the law?
Hehe, huh, me.
"No, it was as if I were standing alone - his position hadn't been telling the good news - I've never seen a man's standing in such a rich man."
The Labour Party is no longer a congregation.
They don't speak in their minds.
When Momentum’s bishops in our group voted to stop me, I was not surprised at all.
In fact, I've come to the conclusion that the MP team has been told that it's not acceptable - just because of the words that we speak in our minds.
President Joan Ryan has received almost the same treatment as the anti-Semitic opposition.
In my case, those who wanted me to shut up criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In a dream of the importance of the proposed financial system, in national security, in Europe, and other amazing things, Jeremy has been in contact with other leaders in the past.
In a statement to the Nottingham East group of workers on Friday said that "we need meetings that are not prejudiced and appreciated."
Almost every two years I'm the MP of a team of ours, the GC meetings of Friday's day have always been a reality.
Unfortunately for me, it's not like conventions in the past and the political promise of "mild, mild-tempered" has been forgotten long ago if, in fact, we've ever been there.
It becomes clear that different opinions are no longer permitted in the Labour Party and that opinions are judged whether they are acceptable to the party leaders.
This starts just after Jeremy became the leader, and my siblings who had the same political views have also looked to me to take sides that I would not agree with - whether it is national security or the same EU market.
No matter what I'm talking about in the community - it's no longer important - there's a wave of violence on social networks saying that I'm out of the way, waste politics, that I don't have to be a member of the Labour Party.
And I am not the only one in this situation.
I know that I'm much happier than my family because the talks about me still seem to be political.
I am still surprised that my brothers still hold them in the workplace and in the determination of those who do not recognize themselves despite sexual or racial prejudice.
One of the most devastating trends in this political era is how the levels of violence are already typical.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week the Labour Party had to set up a border tradition.
The fact is that we no longer see this great and unexpected church or the changing of the party's rules is decreasing.
I've had a lot of advice over the past two years and I've been asked to stop, not to talk too much, and it's going to be "good."
But that's not what I'm getting into politics.
Since I met Labour 32 years ago as a student, I was frustrated by the Government of Thatcher by leaving the bachelor’s liquor, wanting to bring the best public services to those in need – perhaps as a local government or as a government.
I've never been involved in politics, even in my last choice.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused about the law of mia standing and the arguments against current leadership.
For those who have motivated a trip on Friday, all I can say is that when the country continues to move on in the Brexit that will attract homeowners, businesses and our public service, I don't want to spend time and energy honestly on my boss in the Labour party.
In fact, but one message I have that you don't have in mind at Nottingham Momentum, to me, whether it's members in Labour or not: I'm planning on serving you and I promise that there will be no threat or political threat that will prevent you from doing what I believe will be best for you or for all.
Leslie is a MP of East Nottingham.
Ayr has 38-17 Melrose: Ayr has never been able to sit on top.
Two trios who never heard of him did not appreciate the final results, but Ayr can't qualify to be praised in the modern game of Tennant's Premiership.
They are now in the top ten, which is on the side of the ten.
Eventually, their defense, whenever possible, allows them, to set up the homeowners and coaches Peter Murchie has every reason to rejoice.
He said, "We've been tested all our games so far, and we've never been exposed, so I've got to be happy."
Robyn Christie and Melrose said, "We're proud to Ayr, take advantage of every opportunity than we are."
The 14-minute try of Grant Anderson was installed by Frazier Clomi, who put Ayr forward, but, Cap Rory Hughes of the Soctland came up with a drink card, was released from the game Warriors, causing Melrose to make himself on the edges and Jason Baggot caught all the hits.
Clomi nickel Ayr went ahead with the penade, just before, in the first pool, put the solo trying to make 17-5 on Ayr on vacation.
But Melrose on the second floor started well and Patrick Anderson's try, installed by Baggot, reduced to five points.
If there was a period of arrest due to severe injuries Ruaridh Knott, he was thrown out of the cage, if they left and Ayr with force went on to advance with Stafford McDowall, installed by Clomi.
Ayr's holder captain was then placed on a beer card, and also, Melrose was very lucky with Bruce Colvine's try, finally exhausted.
The homeowners returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a drunken ring after kicking Clom without a ball, outside the panel line, MacPherson touched the ground and threw Ayr.
Clomi installed, as he did in the beginning, after Kyle Rowe met a ball set for David Armstrong who sent David Armstrong to the home side on the fifth trimester.
Game star looks like it's setting up its health in restaurants.

"The sea is ours": Bolivian authorities hope that the court will open the way to the Pacific
The drivers of the boat were rigging-clad headquarters and vaults in La Paz.
The spacecraft raises the ocean-blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon: "Our sea is our right."
Restoration is our job.
In all areas of Bolivia, the memory of the Coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century the source is still clear – as you look forward to going to the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope is probably beyond your age, Bolivia is expected to be ruled by a global court of justice on 1 October after five years.
"Bolivia has the power, the spirit of unity and subjection, and it really expects the outcome of it," said Roberto Calzadilla, officially speaking to Bolivia.
Many in Bolivia will watch the CJ ruling on large screens everywhere, with a great hope that the Hague court will reap the Bolivian cry for years – after talks that have sparked years – Chile is forced to negotiate for giving Bolivia control over the ocean.
Evo Morales, the ideal president of Bolivia – facing a long-term exchange of elections in the next year - has a lot to live on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised in late August.
But some critics believe that the court is less likely to harvest Bolivia - and that name will change if he admits.
The Netherlands-backed group has the power to congratulate the Chilean territories, insisting that they never be determined by the outcome of the talks.
The fact that the ICJ ruling came only six months after the debate was heard that the subject was "hard," said a Chilean international law enforcement official, Paz Zárate.
In order to achieve the goals of Bolivia, the last four years may have been a challenge.
"The issue of maritime consumption is unacceptable to Bolivian authorities," said Zarate.
Morales’ campaign to promote violence threatens the cooperation of Chile, and he did so.
Bolivia and Chile will sometime continue to negotiate, but it will be very hard to keep up with after this.
The two countries have not changed since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, who represented Bolivia in Hague, has accused the court of making a decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia "the first unique opportunity for a new relationship with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement on the benefits of both countries," he said.
Calbiilla also denies that Morales – one of the most famous presidents in Latin America – used the maritime issue as a political basis.
"Bolivia will never abandon its obligation to use the Pacific Ocean."
"The decision is a chance that it seems that we need a victory over the past."
The North Korean government has said it will not happen unless it can trust the U.S. government.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will not stop seeking nuclear weapons first unless they rely on Washington.
RI spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the United Nations.
He urged the U.S. to follow his promises at a Singapore conference that was among non-governmental leaders.
His note dates back to the time of America. World Secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be in danger of the first unsolved issue of medicine after three months in Singapore and Kim John Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a fantasy that the U.S. continues to deny the U.S. in an agreement that ends the Korean War and that it has done everything for North Korea.
Washington noted that he refused to make Pyongyang's announcements before he began to destroy his weapons.
Both Kim and the U.S. President Donald Trump needs a second session.
However, there is some doubt that Pyongyang is determined by leaving the world’s weapons that he may consider to be the only safer way.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim and Trump's second meeting.
The Paris fashion showcases a lot of the headdress coming to the dress shops nearby.
If you want to increase the number of your clothes or just close the sun completely, you can no longer look away.
Valentino and Thom Browne have released a list of major headdressers on their SS19 in the Paris Fashion Week show.
This year's videos have been posted on Instagram, and this year's videos have been posted.
Valentino’s fame was a long-distance suit on the sides of a wooden motorcycle and a headmaster’s head.
Some of the major ingredients include gemstones, a typical coat of arms.
Thom Browne reveals the secrets of his face in the Halloween era.
Many facial hides are hidden in the mouth as the Hannibal Lecter rather than the design of the main characters.
Another thing that is built is like underwater swimming suits with breathing and ports.
If you're going to get a new style, you'll be happy.
Model observers realize that large-scale clothing may be on the way to large-scale shopping malls.
The big suit follows soon I'm the 'La Bomba', a two-legged shoe to open on this sunny day, which appears on Rihanna's "everyone" to Emily Ratajkowski.
The basic religious symbol of a non-profit coating that is popular in social media pages sends some goods to the exhibition - nearly equivalent to the swimming pool was shown to the deceased driver.
A flat-floor bag built on a rafia tree, surrounded by rafia, covered with white skin on the road, visiting alone to the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 exhibition in Paris.
Renowned driver Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "I look forward to seeing the big suitcases and marine bags arrive at big shops in the upcoming summer - as the crew have had a big impact on it would be harder to find the need to do more things according to the schedule."
John Edward: Mom skills are important to the citizens of the country.
Individual schools in Scotland maintain good results, and this continues in 2018 with other positive review results, which are only guaranteed for the success of the individual and his sports, arts, music, and other public efforts.
With a stunning number of 30 thousand students in Scotland, these schools represented the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are focused on bringing high-end assistance.
Independent schools aim to prepare students to enter high school levels, as well as their preferred field as citizens in the country.
As an academic gateway to organize and start a special educational program, we see modern monuments continue to become a popular and popular form of education as a school choice.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you talk to a man about a mole, what he says will go directly to his head."
When you talk to him about his mother, what you say comes from the heart."
This is a strong reminder that we will never rely on English and that if we want to build a relationship with the trust and trust of foreign partners.
From the results of this year's test, we can see that the amino acids are the most active in the private schools.
A total of 68 students who have graduated from a high school graduate of A.
The figures, compiled in 70 schools that are members of the SCIS, show that 77 percent of students received Higher A Class A in Mandarin, while 67<0x25> of the rest are German-American, 69<0x25> of the nineteenth-century students.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as important skills for children, young people who will no doubt need them in the future.
Currently as a subject you can choose, it is considered similar to the priorities (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent schools in the field of education and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers were unable to close 17 percent of their capacity to use language skills.
Therefore, language skills are especially important in preparing young people for employment opportunities.
With so many projects I need, these skills are important in the world.
No matter where a person takes the stage, if they read the second grade, they put themselves in a better position for their future to have the same skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad puts a person who is able to speak a lot of museums ahead of those who compete with them.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, seventeen (75) percent were unable to speak well of foreign language and good communication, and French is the only one that was raised by more than ten percent of the population, making up about 15 percent of the numbers.
This is why educational education is important for today's children.
Having a lot of education you know, especially those of developing countries, will help raise children with better chances of getting a better job.
In Scotland, schools and schools vary from country to country.
Most of these schools focus primarily on teaching older and current emigrants, while some teach emigrants that are considered the most important in the UK when viewed in this year 2020, such as Mandarin and Japan.
Regardless of what your child likes, there are many types of campuses where you can choose from in private schools, and you can recommend them here.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a educational environment that will prepare children and explain to the children the skills needed to succeed, in this future that is governed by them.
In recent times, businesses around the world will continue to play an important role in the future of the country, so the melody is reflected in education.
In fact, modern films have to be included in "the global communication skills."
Individual schools will continue to provide for this occasion, the differences, and the intimacy of the younger Scotlands.
You have to do well.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
Lebron will play his first game in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
It's nearly over to the fans waiting to see Lebron James playing his first Los Angeles Lakers game.
Training coach Luke Walkon has announced that James will play on a weekly basis for the opening of the season's games, and will play with Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, for how many minutes they'll be playing.
"There will be more than one to be less than twenty-eight," said Walton on Lakers page.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell reported on Twitter that James is more likely to play for more than a minute.
After training this week, James has been asked about his program and Lakers for six games he has played before starting the season.
"I don't want to play games to start the season right now at my stage so I'm ready to start playing," he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time is featured on YouTube
President Donald Trump starts a wave of talks in the Wheeling program, West Virginia.
Trump's first 5th race has been scheduled for the next week, including standing in friendly spots numbered by Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote that will decide to close the Supreme Court's seat, Trump aims to build fans in this internal election as the Republicans suffer from losing control of the body on Monday.
When will the Trip's election in West Virginia begin?
The Trimp selection race in Wheeling, West Virginia will start at 7 p.m. at night, Saturday, 29 Dec. 2018.
You can watch the trump selection in West Virginia by entering YouTube to see what's happening right now.
Trump is likely to lead the hearing of the week's Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who is prosecuted by the Senate's prosecutor's prosecution.
However, the aim of the campaign is to help the Republicans find the motivation to face the election of Monday.
Thus, President Trump said in his campaign that the five-week drive aims to "give the interest of voters and supporters as Republicans strive to protect and increase the number of followers who are in the parliament," Reuters said.
"The management of the board is important in the multinational presidential plan that can visit him as he is responsible for the critical moments of the campaign," Trump's spokesman denied Reuters' statement to discredit his name.
It is scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the modern car races can bring followers from "Ohio and Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh's social media broadcast," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the country won more than 20 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican Senate.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president comes to try to welcome him with a choice," said Simon Haeder, a political advocate at the University of West Virgina, according to Reuters.
The Ryder 2018 team hopes to fight to keep the hopes of a single day game on Sunday.
After a three-part session, on Saturday afternoon, the Ryder Cup probably had to be repeated four times.
It's a great game, but players don't believe in it.
Where are they now going to say it?
"They're leading six points and now they're just four, so we're going to continue as if with little power I think," Jordan Spieth said as they're driving a little bit a day.
Europe has a chance, in fact, four points ahead of twenty-two.
The Americans, as Spieth says, have little fun and much to be encouraged by it, not in the style of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together every day and each scored three and four points each.
Spieth has always been dangerous and led by example.
Those who watched it were very happy when I was, playing with patience the golf is essential to match the game where he and Thomas are both equal.
His golf team won the game on 15th anniversary of the same joy, which suggests that he believes that the American team is not running.
"You're going to have to have to be full and worry about your game," Spieth said.
It's probably one of the current players.
There are 18 symbols.
The only player with more scores than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days is Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, not asked at the Ryder Cup.
Europe's uniqueness is unique, but it's very strong and well-established.
"Moliwood" is the only catalogue that could not start the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoid the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
This runs, as both have the warmth from the angry outdoors who conclude that they are the winners on Sunday, and there will be no more famous players who will be interested in winning Europe as the sun hits the Golf National rather than the Fleetwood or Molinari.
They are both different from each other.
The popularity of the European Union has not changed.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did little work for Sergio Garcia, the four-star champions in the morning, when he was interviewed by Alex Noren.
Bogey and two leading pairs left the long-term Spanish and Swedish flag that they could not afford.
On Sunday, no one can help you out.
Fourballs and foursomes enjoy watching around because of the cooperation between parents, the advice they give us, the advice they give us and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played well as a team and led it to the final but foursomes have shown that the U.S. Army still has the potential to continue, by selecting the Stateside, doubtless.
Europe took 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will be hosting many great conferences on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving fourballs and foursomes on Saturdays 10-6 lead to the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari won twice the Tiger Woods with four Golf points.
On the European side, Thomas Bjorn, determined to score a league that lost to Hazeltine two years ago, America's loss in the four-season lead, placing a series of 3-1.
The U.S. is hard-working even foursomes, winning two games, but it can't just fill the bee.
Jim Furyk, on the other hand, needs nine points in the 12th Sunday games to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first in Europe to win the matches after he and Molinari called him "Molliwood" after a good weekend and won four points in their four opening matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
In contrast to Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they subsequently surrendered to Bryson Dechambeau in 5<0x26>4.
Woods, who entered the two games of the Test, showed great determination but he has now lost 19 games in 29 fourballs and foursomes in a row.
Justin Rose, based in the morning's fourballs, returned to Henrik Stenson in the 2nd <0x26> 1st round to defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – the first and third round in the world.
And they are determined to return to strength in any way they can find it, just look at it, and get rid of it.
Jordan Spieth and Justin are three times attractive to the United States for three points on Saturday.
They won 2<0x26>1 by defeating Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in fourballs and later split Poulter and Rory McIlroy in 4<0x26>3 in foursomes while beating two open minas.
In the history of the Ryder Cup only two teams from four wins to one game, and Furyk on the other side needs only a balance to protect the cup.
After doing better for two days, or so, the attack on Sunday seems to break them off.
North Korea says it will “not be” without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that it continues to deepen the integrity of the United States and it is impossible for the country to free nuclear weapons under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's general assembly that North Korea has done "related" last year, such as prevention of toxins and nuclear tests, eliminating waste areas, and promising to disarm your weapons and technology.
He said, "We don't see the U.S."
"Without confidence in the U.S. there will be no hope for the country's security, and under this condition there is no way for us to self-sacrifice first."
While Ri did not agree with North Korea's refusal to "substantiate" Washington's withdrawal while North Korea could be confirmed by taking action, the statement is proof that we do not guarantee your complete completion as Pyongyang did before.
Ri refers to a statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump for the first time meeting between the U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim asked to work on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula when Trump promised North Korea's defence.
North Korea has been trying to successfully complete the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang would release nuclear weapons first.
Washington has always refused to release North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "the end of the first draft" and raises the levels of pressure of the law to achieve its objectives, and also rejects "a declaration to end the war"," says Ri.
"It's important to understand that law can affect the dreams of people who don't care about us.
But the problem is that progress has deepened our trust.
Ri did not specify plans for a reunion between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader has appeared in the United Nations from week to week.
At least three meetings were held between Kim and South Korea leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If a part of the matter of your termination is going to South Korea and not the U.S., the end of your Korean peninsula will not be enough to contribute to this."
Even so, the hearing of Ri's speech was completely different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly this year to look at the U.S. and North Korea's rockets that were held after "Mr. President Trump" called Kim "rocket on the move."
This year, the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "finish completely" North Korea, exalt Kim's courage to act independently, but there is still much more to be done and the law remains until North Korea breaks the ban.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for everything, saying "if it takes two, three, or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia disputed that the UN Security Council had suspended Pyongyang for action.
Nonetheless, U.S. State Secretary Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's mandate must proceed with force and not fail until the conclusion is complete."
The Security Council has agreed to support North Korea in violation of the law since 2006 in the establishment of taxpayers and the Ballistic missile system of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly and said that after all, they visited and Pyongyang next month prepared for the second time.
Pompeo has been visiting North Korea three times this year, but his last trip is not good.
He left Pyongyang in July that progress was made, North Korea only made it clear to him "only a criminal raid."
North Korea plans to hold a meeting with the Moon this month to end the missile area and a combination of gases if the United States takes "the same steps."
Kim said he told me "in the same steps" he wanted to strengthen security when Trump promised to Singapore and create a common relationship with Washington.
Harvard school students are able to get enough sleep.
A new course at Harvard University this year all those who do not sleep too much to overcome the habit of training using caffeine ‘all night.’
The education sectors have found many students in primary universities that they have nothing when it comes to basics that they can take care of.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a doctor in Brigham and Women's Hospital, established a ice cream, for the first time in the US.
He was encouraged to start the course after giving a talk about how to sleep while reading.
'At the end of it a girl came to me and said, 'Why is this told me now, in my middle age?'
She said that no one ever told her about sleep — something amazing to me," she told Telegram.
The course is first published this year, explaining to students the importance of sleep habits enough to help the catalyst and exercise, and improves the quality of daily life.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of university's health services, said the university decided to diecourse after finding that most students do not sleep at all during the week.
The length of the study involves a series of events.
The first part contains a picture of the school room, where students choose coffee commissions, panels, coaches and books that discuss the effects of caffeine and light exercises on how sleep is beneficial.
On the other hand, participants are told that long-term avoidance of sleep increases risks of heart disease, tuberculosis, expectancy, and cancer.
The map, with useful symbols, will thereby encourage those who have a part in encouraging them to think about their daily routine.
‘We know that he will not change the behavior of the disciples.’
We believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know about your health by choosing tobacco,' adds Professor Czeisler.
The practice of self-government 'in the community until' is done, which means that modern technological technologies and extreme pressures for students reduce the levels of sleep that are going to be dramatically diminished.
To ensure that you are sleeping enough, enough, there must be a student’s ‘secret weapon’ to overcome stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says – that means avoiding old age, as insomnia involves a sense of hunger, which causes them to flee.
Raymond Shuthi, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to create a study, which he studied in one of his classes last year while studying his first year in Harvard.
He said that the study opened his eyes and urged him to complete the study throughout the school.
The next step, hopefully, is to ask higher self-esteem students to learn the same way in this learning program before joining the top competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler suggests that the students should think about throwing the alarms while going to bed, as well as that they will wake up here, and understand the negative impact of the ‘green light’ that came out of electric screens and LED lights, which can get you out of the curve.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The Story of Manga's men Gerrard
Rangers were organized and went on to defeat Dolly Menga who attacked the side of Steven Gerrard's half-truth and lost 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox side intended to record their first record since their defeat on February 4-1 in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team involved the second Gerrard defeat in 18 games as manager left his debut with eight points for the Premiershirts.
It's a 7-minute attack in front of the Half-Time and Rangers have to endure without moving to the region.
While Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingston glides in third place and behind Hibernian separates in this article.
And there may be a problem with the Rangers after you discover Calum Spence, who was first assisted after the accident caused by something far-reaching.
Gerrard made eight changes to the previous Ayr side to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Live 11 that missed the point on Hearts last week and would be happy with the way your well-dressed clothes had cut off his fans' air around the corner.
Rangers are probably very close to football but Livingston has done a lot with the ball they got.
It would have been a couple of minutes before Menga's release would send Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's article but the abortion actress left a great chance for a ballgame.
Keaghan Jacobs' free kick has found Craig Halkettoyi-skipper but her husband-in-law, Alan Lithgow, has fallen off the back.
Rangers managed to control but were more confident than trusting in their game in the third round of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt as if he had to get a penalty on his own during a fight with Steve Lawless but the poet Steven Thomson cancelled the Colombian application.
Rangers were able to put two points in the first half directly in front of the panel but had an older Ibrox column Liam Kelly without worrying about the crack placed by Lassana Coulibaly's head and the narrow attack on Ovie Eria.
While Livi opens up to 34th innings may not have been in the game, no one would deny that they were fit for their performance.
Rangers have also failed to resist Jacobs football club.
Scott Arfield didn't do anything while Declan Gallagher, Scott Robinson, who had shot Menga for easy finishing.
Gerrardube also played the game after a vacation while changing Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change was almost imminent when the gambler sank to Morelos but Kelly shrugged a curve from his line to block it.
But Livingston went on to describe the viewers by playing their favourite game, and Lithgow and Halkett scored long-term balls.
Holt's side could open the lead in the final stages, but McGregor stopped stopping Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball with a head on the back.
Rangers, Glenn Middleton, found a long-standing tie while confronting Jacobs but also Thomson's side.
Almanac: Geiger Counter
And now our page of "The Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and BALA ... the day when the physicist of tomorrow John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of obtaining and rating radioactivity, which was established to lead to a device that was ultimately built by the Geiger Counter.
The science giant since then, the Geiger Counter became a pop-class cricketer, such as the 1950 films "Balls of Coronado," which featured scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man asked, "Is that it?"
Rogers: "Geiger Counter, used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
"When you're installing open phones, you can hear atoms extracted from radioactivity by minerals."
Evans: "It's out now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days later at the age of 63.
But this is what has been created to bear His name forever and ever.
A new goal of cancer can teach the protective system to ‘see’ the wrong cells
A new cancer goal can teach the protective system to ‘see’ the wrong cells and kill them
The goal is to teach the protective system to ‘see’ the wrong cells as a medical system
How it involves taking cells for the patient's defense system, it has been replaced by a diabetic
"He sees" the common protein in many cancers and is recovered.
The goal of the vaccine is to ensure that patients with cancer are affected.
A woman with a goal-oriented body, who teaches a protective system to see the incorrect cells, saw breast cancer disappear within 18 months.
This method involves taking protective cells from the patient, converted to laboratory to "see" a common protein in most HER2 cancers, and then re-evaluate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a promising goal."
HER2 "promotes the growth of cancer species," including breastfeeding, breastfeeding, fever, and other cancers, explains Prof Berzofsky.
Another way to take protective cells from patients is to teach them how you understand the cancer cells that are effective in treating certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West was in the sense of establishing Trump, wearing a MAGA uniform, after his appearance with a cellulose.
It's not going well
Kanye West is hit by the studio on Saturday Night Live after singing praises US President Donald Trump and says he will join the election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town where he wore a pianist written by the Great Americans, he was the first to be angry with Democrats and confirmed Trump's stance.
"I often talk to the president and say, 'How do you love Trump, you hate them?'"
"If I had been in the United States for a long time," he said.
The SNL began the program with a piece of Matt Damon where Hollywood's well-known Hollywood criticised the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Justice Committee for sexual misconduct by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it wasn't broadcast, the western anger section was posted on social media by the joker Chris Rock.
It's unclear that Rock tried to distract West from writing.
In addition, the West complained to the observers that they had taken him to the back of the stairway and put him on the head.
"They took me out of the room.
"You don't have any clothes," he said.
They're strong!
"I'm still in a state of emergency," said a researcher in Washington.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see a place in the desert?" he said "you can wear your superman cape, because it means you won't tell him what to do. Want the world to go on?
Try the love."
Not surprisingly, in the past two countries are viewers and members of the SNL team who are shy, Variety writes, and one tells the publishers: "The silence of the studio."
West was inducted with musician Ariana Grande's long-term suspension, her old bread, the rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago.
Western is a song I love, I love it, and I love it.
West was tweeted by the former TPUSA leader, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "It's a wonderful courage: we're going to be able to do it and we're going to do it."
But Karen Hunter, a spokesman for a tweet, wrote on Twitter that West "brings a man who is sitting down and just that's good."
"But I choose not to impress anyone (by buying his music or clothing or establishing his "art") which I believe they put and filled with a dangerous sense of community.
You are free.
"We are," he added.
In front of the show, the rapper has tweeted on Twitter to change his name, which is now called "the old name Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper's partner, Snoop Dogg, was once called Snoop Lion and also the late singer Prince, changed his name with a mark and was named Prince.
Killing in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a kidnapper was killed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.

The checks will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Kit Harington's best-selling actress
Kit Harington is well-known for his playground for the Jon Snow in a series of ancient violent HBO Game of Thrones.
But the actress, 31, criticizes the heroic tradition, saying such places on the screen that for young boys they need to be strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that something would go well and asked how it could be handled by the typical culture of <0x23>Nami as well.
Kit, a newly married sister in the Game of Thrones Leslie, also 31, has admitted that he too ‘defends himself’ in the face of the problem.
"I feel so alone, I'm so deeply troubled, nowadays - life is all around me?," he said.
"What do we learn from the experiences that we have now?"
Kit believes that television can have a slight impact on the negative behavior of a husband because of the advocates who are struggling with it.
He continued, "What's the nature of education?
What's happening on TV, and on the streets, makes young people sure that they're a man?
I think that's the biggest problem at this time – we're changing that?
For there is something wrong with the young men."
In the discussion, he also admitted that he will not make prequels or sequels at Game of Thrones while the game will go to the end of the summer, saying he has finished with the battlefields."
Starting in November Kit will play in Sam Shepard's West Truth, a story about filmmaker and his brother, who is stunning.
The actor has recently revealed that he thinks his wife, Rose, will be a real thing that ever came out of the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the game, so she gave me a family tomorrow, my life to look at now," she said.
Rose played Ygritte, Kit Character Jon Snow's love for the Emmy fantasy series.
The couple got married in December 2018 in Leslie's apartment in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China expects 14<0x25> to continue in new circumstances
China announces a 14<0x25> increase in the number of people living with AIDS and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, according to health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases have come.
Most of the new cases have been passed through sex, making changes in the past.
But the number of AIDS victims in this way has been reduced to zero, the Chinese health officials said at the Yunnan provincial assembly.
Every year, the number of people living with AIDS and AIDS has risen to 100,000.
The AIDS epidemic is not a small problem in LGBT community.
China's sexual assault on sexyp was cancelled in 1997, but it was banned from homosexuals.
As a result of life-threatening methods, studies have shown that 70-90<0x25> of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women.
Most of the infections result from the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases in this relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged land access to disasters as efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that another task is to disrupt the knowledge of the GOP senators, explodes the "until" lies and "critical cybercrime."
In the U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters has alleged that one of her employees has posted a three-second information in the Republican U.S. on the official page of Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrats have stated that these allegations are linked to "ultra-right Wing" and websites.
"Human lies, lies, and a lot of other lies are misleading," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Details of the explosion include home addresses and numbers of U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both in Utah.
The information comes from online on Thursday, placed on Capitol Hill while being heard by the Senate's panel on charges of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The incident occurred after Kavanaugh was asked three senators.
Older sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address indicates that the Waters office is connected to it and that it is the largest source of Waters' work information, reports Hill.
"These unreasonable accusations are false and are not true," the Waters continued.
"The correctness of my employees – ownership, personal information, and safety of the victims as a result of fraudulent and false accusations – has not been involved in the explosion of the information.
These fundamental truths are false and they are not true."
Waters' statement was almost a criticism on the Internet, including the senior White House secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's hard to get tired," writes Fleischer.
"This means that he doesn't have the courage to stand up.
If a person is accused of something they have not done, they should not be satisfied.
They should not be denied.
They don't have to defend the defendant's motives.
They need to be calm and peaceable."
Fleischer claims to compare Waters' response to the criticism of the Democrat Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being heavily involved during the trial on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican incumbent who will enter Waters' shoes in the mid-term election, breathe with his opinion on Twitter.
"It's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed "the right authorities and the law enforcement authorities on these allegations of fraud.
"We will ensure that the defendants are discredited," he continued, "and they will be charged with all their allegations of degradation and hazardous activity wherever or wherever my employees are."
View by Johnny English Strikes Again – ignoring the power of the spy poof of Rowan Atkinson
It is now customary to look at the importance of Brexit in any British film and does not look forward to the revival of the Johnny English drama – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and its return in 2011 to the Johnny English Reborn.
Is it possible to buy a new product, as mentioned in the article?
At any rate, an open eye, Johnny English's face with the authority to promote new things – the name is a great comedy designed for movie theaters for people who do not speak English.
He's actually an intellectual investigator who's even more incomprehensible than his unusual use will feature Clouseau, Mr Bean's retirement and his charities from the Charities of Fire Theatre at the London 2012 Open Olympics.
And from a traveler and a mysterious man who passes through advertisements that are now violent on Barclaycard TV, which has left a controversy in his wake.
There are two other occasions in the current tour of JE.
I love Johnny English, who runs the helicopter and covers the old military base and small arms that hang on his coat.
Atkinson's gift of humor is a show, but laughter seems to be less and more attractive, especially in the production of films "in depth" like 007 and Mission Impossible itself is now offering jokes as an asset.
Kids seem to have discovered children more than adults, and for me the journey of Johnny English is shy and fresh and focused on Atkinson's unheard film added to the sounds and personality of Bean.
The issue is now being resolved that the Great Britain is a big deal.
The cyber-hacker enters the secret network of British researchers, revealing the details of Britain's enterprises in the design, which concerns the enzyme set in the work – which is a small task for Kevin Eldon.
The last moment in the full-time Prime Minister's carrying and competing flexibility, facing failure in the political community: Emma Thompson tries to imitate Teresa-May, but there's nothing in the text he can do about it.
His investigators informed him that all the investigators had been arrested, and they had to follow the person in charge.
This means that Johnny English is itself, now as a schoolmaster in a cost-effective area, but offers unfamiliar lessons about how you look at an assessor: these classes, as the English academy provides theory of research at Rock-type academy.
English was promoted to Whitehall to be given rapid orders and merged with Bough's partner, played again Ben Miller.
Bough is still a married man, composed of submarine commander, a beautiful place played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin are really sleeping in the Queen's secret service back, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
There, the prime minister quickly stresses the development of billions who say he can solve computer problems: the singer Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough began the journey of the baboon: they shot like a dot, started a fire at a restaurant in France; they started a problem with the Volta-based ship; and English that removed the flag while learning to use the Virtual Reality Headset to bring home.
All efforts have been made to improve the last chapter or to be friendly and warm, there are children's TV about everything.
It's a complete set.
And like other Johnny English films I couldn't control myself: the British film industry couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a good place to show his talent?
Labour refuses to set up a plan for Britons to work for four days but is paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's team of Labour think of a fantastic plan to see Britons working for four victims – but paid five.
The group reported that it requires company managers to pass the profits made by Artificial Intelligence (AI) to employees by providing them a more day.
Workers seem to enjoy three real days of the week – but lead the same money.
According to sources, this view may fit the group's economic objective as well as the program to translate the nation to employees.
A four-day transition to the Union Congress as a way to take the opportunity to change the economy.
An elderly Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "Police testing is expected to take place before the end of the year.
"It's not going to happen at night but in four days at the church, but working four days is something that's not expected of the team's recruitment process to recover the workers and the whole idea of the industry."
The Labour Party will not be the first to promote the strategy, and the Green Party is bound for four working days during its 2017 general election campaign.
The goal is not yet established by the entire Labour Party, however.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day job is not an organization's police force and is not considered by the group.
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to express his view of the socialist revolution on economics.
Mnz McDonnell said he is willing to be proud and power again to ‘experts’ and ‘benefits’ to the fans.
The program also describes that shareholders in water companies may not have found the whole stadium as Labour government is doing the "incorrect" in the wrong directions.
He also ensured that employees in the company's boards and Inclusive Ownership Funds give 10 percent of the private-sector firms' equity to employees, who will compensate for an annual profit at <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, told "60 Minutes" that the FBI's research on Kavanaugh could change their minds.
A FBI investigation by Judge Brett Kavanaugh has undergone the election of the Supreme Court last week, and raised questions that founders could change how Republican senators are attracting fans.
In an interview titled on Sunday, "60 Minutes" with talks Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI if they can find something to change their minds.
Kennedy seems more comfortable than her friends in South Carolina.
"I'm sure," Kennedy said.
"I went to court, and I spoke to the judge Kavanaugh.
I called out to him after he had done this, and he said, 'What have you done?'
"He's a scary, unconscious and unconscious."
Graham's character, however, seems to have been selected.
"My opinion has decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it will take a solid criticism," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what's happening, but I know this: Brett fast," added Graham, describing Christine Blasey Ford.
"All readers are not sure of that.
It has been 36 years.
I can't see anything change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and what is it that is trying to reduce poverty?
On Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a year-round event with a list of competitive players who will play with the same objectives; to end the world's violence.
Now in the seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will have a massive peak in the Central Park to not only entertain Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but to spark a real desire to end the bridge by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is the global Poverty Project, a global group that strives to eradicate corruption by increasing the population.
In order to get a ticket for the event (except if you want to pay tickets for VIP tickets), dancers had to do something "do" such as voluntarily, sending an email to the world leader, calling or doing something deeper to help you crack down.
How successful was the Global Citizen in the last 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of benefiting people with a free concert is a proper way to try people to do something, or just another so-called "clicktivism" – people who feel like they make a difference by signing a list on a computer or posting it on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has ranked over 19 million "acts" of its followers, adding to the implementation of various objectives.
It says these actions have helped to disrupt the world's survivors in the fight against self-esteem and policies of more than <0x24>37 billion that will affect the lives of 2,25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the group began to cover 390 views and notices from their actions, about <0x24>10 billion stolen or tried to collect.
The group estimates that the amount obtained has a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Other dedications include The Power of Nutrition, U.S. investors and beginners dedicated to "saving children in a proper way," are promised to provide Rwanda <0x24>35 million to help end hunger in the country after receiving 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
"With the establishment of a UK government, donors, international governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can try to make a history of human malnutrition due to the lack of justice in society," the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman said in a concert in London 2018.
The group also said that for more than 5,000 years to call the U.K. to improve the nutritious diet of mothers and children, the government has announced the support of the project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children in good health.
In response to some of the FAQs on their website, they ask, "What do you think we can do to eliminate a lot of violence?"
Global citizen replied: "There will be a long and difficult way—sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as social rights and anti-parteiid protests in front of us, we will win, because we are very powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe will share in this year's event in New York, which was hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use antibiotics to "safe" prevent the transfer of Russian energy - Interior Secretary
Washington "if necessary" can use Antilope to block Russian markets of energy, including the Middle East, U.S. Internal Secretary Ryan Zinke found him, with the coverage of the Washington Examiner.
They have all said Russian and Syrian negotiations - clearly, when it operates with the coupling of the official government – is a way of trying other new markets of energy.
"I believe in the reason that the Middle East wants to get an energy like that in Eastern Europe, and in the middle of the european and Europe," he said.
And, according to the employee, there are ways to fix it.
"The United States is able, by our organization, to ensure that seaways are open, and, if necessary, closed, to ensure that their power is not in the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to those present at the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling himself "the voice of the user" in the United States.
He also compared Washington's efforts to cooperate with Russia and Iran, saying the results are the same.
"Opting to trade with Iran and Russia, at a certain point, is a means of gaining and obtaining oil," he said, when speaking of Russia as a "thinking horse" and has an economic reliability for oil purposes.
These statements come true as the Trump offices are trying to promote the export of their natural gases to Europe, to replace Russia, the fastest-run route for European consumers.
As a result, Trump's office officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to come out of the North Stream 2 "inappropriate" transcription project, according to Trump, made Berlin "under" Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Stream 2 <0x24>11 billion pipes, which are scheduled to double the number of existing pipes now up to 110 billion cubic meters, are actually an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's unrelenting opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of an unfair competition.
"I believe we have the same view that power cannot be a tool to put pressure on and that consumers should be able to choose who they are to buy," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S.'s stance has led to Germany's resignation, confirming its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has told the U.S. to withdraw from the EU's energy policy and the agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when the third world interferes with our shipping," said Lieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider" the presidential election in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider" the election to be president after a mid-term election.
During a meeting at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren has confirmed that he will consider the intervention.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and reorganize our corrupt government, including a woman who will be the leader," he said.
"After November 6, I'm going to consider entering the election as president."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during a city hall session, saying that he "speaks to people who distract him."
"I'm very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our people," he said.
Warren was speaking freely about Trump and the one who elected him to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement to Tweeter on Friday, Warren said that "it is true that we need a FBI investigation before voting."
A report published on Thursday, however, revealed that most of Warren's followers do not think they should enter elections in 2020.
50<0x25> of the "probably" populations of Massachusetts say the senator should not participate in the election, in accordance with the statistics obtained by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32 percent have been supportive of it.
statistics have shown further support for former Emperor Deval Patrick’s decision-making, 38 percent of whom say he is unfit, and 48 percent say he is not.
Some of the names discussed in the top profile Democrats that may have entered the 2020 election include former President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a legal decision in January, reporting the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin at Donald Trump's meeting.
Track Palin, 26, spent the whole year in Iraq after a war in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my son is facing, what he is going through, I see how other families feel about the PTSD's tragic consequences and other injuries that the soldiers do not return," he told the audience at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the elephant in the enclosure" and said of his son and other warriors, "they were once again a different people, re-established, and wondered whether there was any respect for what he was about to possess by the army and the air force, and all the rest of the soldiers, for their land."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence for raping a woman, he disrupted family violence report and the time of drinking, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports the work of a new security policy
The 18 states and District of Columbia support a new legal effort to have a new U.S. policy that prohibits the protection of people who escape gang violence or domestic violence.
representatives of 18 provinces and provinces sent the government a witness on Friday in Washington to support a person in need of protection against this policy, reports the NBC News.
The full name of the prosecutor to Grace v. Sessions that the American Civil Liberties Union has installed in August against the government's policy was not revealed.
He said his colleagues and "his sons are members of violent conduct," harassed him, but U.S. officials responded to his request for protection on July 20.
He has been living in Texas.
The government advocates of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, producing many people with U.S. security applications, such as nations facing serious problems with guns and domestic violence.
A new U.S. security policy has taken into account the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed unpaid immigrants to flee domestic violence to find security.
Attorney General of Columbia County, Karl Racine, said in his statement that a new policy "has not passed decades of state law, and the world."
"The law states that all applications for protection must be judged by the facts concerning each application, and making such a decision is to violate the law," the court said.
Prosecutors also pointed out that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the U.S. economy, saying they can be businesses and "make job opportunities."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions advised the jury to no longer protect people from domestic violence and racism in June.
"People can be protected if they leave their country due to racial, religious, ethnic, national, or political views," Sessions said in a statement on June 11 on the policy.
Protection was not intended to solve all of the problems - even with all the major problems - people who face them every day around the world.
Strong efforts have been made in Paul as the number of deaths is repeated in attempts to find survivors
For those who have survived, it's a state of emergency.
"It's really sad," said 35-year-old Risa Kuzuma, who comforts her son at a hospital for those who have survived the city of Palu.
"Every minute, the body brings the body.
We don't have clean water."
Citizens seem to return to their landlords, look for their goods in many waters, and try to find anything they can find.
Hundreds of people also do not have hospitals, which are subject to a 7.5-percent test, are full of secrets.
Some of the defendants, including Dwi Haris, who had broken a gun and a gun, were sitting outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were rushed out due to an ongoing trial.
She was filled with tears in her eyes when she recalled her efforts in a hotel room on the fifth floor she lived with her wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time for survival.
"I've been stressed about the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city of marriage.
"My wife cried out for help, and I was relieved.
I don't know what happened to her and her family.
I hope they are alive."
The U.S. prosecutor accuses China of "frightening" by "false advertisements"
A week later a Chinese official newspaper had a four-page advertisement showing U.S. commercial goods that benefit both the U.S. and China, a U.S. consulate in China accused Beijing of using a U.S. newspaper to propagate lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday about the paid Chinese daily in Des Moines Register - an Iowa newspaper that was purchased for errors - after he allegedly wanted to participate in the Nov. 6-China election.
Trump's claim that Beijing was trying to take part in the U.S. election has created what U.S. officials have said in Reuters is a new phase in the Washington campaign to press China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to trade, Beijing and Washington are now taking the lead in a growing trade war that creates a constant exchange of payments in exchange for goods.
The money required by China at the beginning of the trade war was intended to exploit delegates in places such as the Iowa supporting the Republican Party of Trump, according to Chinese and U.S. researchers.
Terry Branstad, a U.S. ambassador to China and a long-term Iowa ruler, who sends a lot of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
In China, Branstad wrote on the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "we doubled this abuse by making false advertisements in our free journal."
"In a press release, the Chinese government has made it available in the popular American culture of freedom of speech with a free newspaper by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," writes Branstad.
"On the contrary, in the street market in Beijing, there are not many different opinions that you will find and you will not see the real reaction of the various Chinese views that may have with regard to the serious consequences of China's economy," the reporter said.
He added that "one of China's leading newspapers fled the opportunity to publish" his story, though he did not say which one of the newspapers was.
Republicans Killed Women Who Voted Before the Interior Election and Due to the Failure of Kavanaugh, Warnings
Since many high Republicans are waiting and defending at the time of the Supreme Court's incumbent Brett Kavanaugh's incredulous accusations, critics warned that the storm will return with enthusiasm, especially those standing, during the internal and future elections.
The top panels in this regard, and many Republicans have already expressed their desire to continue with the election.
Those things will not be eradicated," Grant Reeer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's final attempts (R-Arizona) to have the FBI investigated would be enough to make the voters to drop the votes.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will never forget tomorrow and November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, an advisor to red and national spokesman for MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington newspaper, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesters shouted "He's coming for November!" as they were chasing the Senate hall as the Republicans ruled the judiciary Committee chose to move forward and choose Kavanaugh despite evidence sent by Dr. Christine Blasec.
"The interest of Democrats and lyrics will soon end," said St. Rothenberg, a politically neutral analyst, to the media.
"People say it's hot; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among women's voters in cities and youth voters, aged 18 to 29, that although they did not like the president, they are rarely voted."
Even before the evidence of Ford was clear about his allegations of counterfeiting at the time of the Supreme Court, critics said that the storm would not return if the Republicans continued to confirm it.
"This has been a GOP damage," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to the NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or last vote or that Kavanaugh has been placed in the cabinet, but also about how the Republicans have treated him," said Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA, a group that helps people choose the Democrats, the latest.
However, the Americans seem to differ between who believes in the evidence of Ford and Kavanaugh, and they tend to see the Kavanaugh.
New figures from YouGov show that 41 percent of the people are sure or at a certain point believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say it is, of course, or at some point, a belief in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was sure or at some point lying to his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating charges by Ford and at least one prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford spoke before the Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had been drinking at the age of 17.
Ramirez said the prosecutor of the Supreme Court showed him his private bodies during the mid-1980s period of his study in Yale.
World Wide Web developer plans to launch a new internet connection with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web, launches a program that will deal with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new technological project, Inrupt, is a company built on the open source of the Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and information that people are not allowed to access.
In a unique interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made a joke that the aim of the Inrupt "is to lead the world."
"We have to do it now," he said.
"It's history."
This app uses Solid technology to allow people to make themselves a "personal online database" or POD.
There may be a list of people's numbers, which you should do, calendar, music pump, and other professional and personal tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
It's important to note that the POD store depends on the user who you can get the type of information.
The company calls it "the data that makes you strong."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company's CEO of John Bruce, is that the company has the licenses, prosesis and proper skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently has Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM security platform purchased by IBM, an IBM-based co-founder of contractors working on the project, as well as many voluntary co-founders.
Since this week, technicians around the world may have developed their apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team of speakers and "Facebook and Google that should or should not be taken into account a complete change in which their entire business will completely change.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on a Medium posted on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "desperately seeks to provide commercial energy and operating systems that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new website built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has led the debate on neutrality.
Even with the release of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm looking forward to the start of this future web site," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Welcome to the Victoria Cross of WW1
Only the Church of England's clergy had Victoria Cross during World War I has been deported to their home city after 100 years.
Lt Col Bishop Bernard Vann received a prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellengsese and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later and did not find that he had won the largest award in Britain.
A memorial stone has been opened to his two grandchildren during a mass in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandparents, Michael Vann, said it was a "good sign" that the stone was opened in the first century since his grandfather received the award.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his army to cross the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a group that sparked the ground with guns and guns."
He then rushed to the shooting area and with "mighty courage" he took the lead before running with a gun and killed three soldiers.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German bomber on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his grandfather's actions are "something that I don't know I could do but something that would make me respect him."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, placed flowers after the massacre, created by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "the nation has the great privilege of being part of the militia" and that "the military's strength is demonstrated by the support of the masses."
The MMA fans stay all night to watch the Bellator 206, but they get Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you're staying all night to watch the Bellator 206 and are banned from watching the event.
The San Jose event consisted of 13 games, including six in the main card and was featured overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00am, as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to fight, UK viewers were left surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were thrilled after waiting all night until the morning, especially waiting for the tournament.
One Twitter fan explains this to convert children to poppies as "unexpected gambling."
"It is the government's law that on 6 a.m. the competition is inappropriate so it has had to be changed in the children's system," said Dave Schwartz, president of Bellator's marketing and communications campaign, when asked about the change of the program.
"Pick the piggy," he said.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would look at their assessments in order to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about playing it again, I think we can try to play it," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday and we can't fix this until Sunday, Monday at its time.
But above it.
I tell you that at the time of the change there was a lot of messages sent to it and it was all unpleasant.
When we tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case with the government.
I promise it will never happen again.
We're going to keep five races out of six - as often as we do - and we're trying to please our followers and we're too busy.
It's an unsatisfactory situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'simplified' for her sexuality
The Olympic champion Tom Daley says he grew up being sexually abused by his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old spokesman said he didn't even notice until he went to high school saying "Not everyone loves me."
Speaking of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs first published by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke of homosexual rights to give others "hope."
He also said that if his parents were to win the Olympics, he would not be able to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular nurse in the program, has been inactive for months because of illness.
As a left-handed person in Laverne's first program, Daley said she feels "annoyed" for everyone when she grew up because "it was unacceptable to love boys and girls."
"To this day, those feelings are nothing, they are different, and the real feelings that have given me the strength and the strength to succeed," he said.
He wanted to show that he too is a "human," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when he finally found out that he was gay.
The winner who won the Olympic medal twice has become a high-profile man who promoted LGBT and used his status in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge other countries not to view you as homosexual.
He said he has spoken because he feels lucky to be able to live a life without having problems and wants to give others "hope."
The hero who won three times in the World Cup said he had sex with a man - a U.S. filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013.
Daley got married and was awarded an Oscar award, who left him 20 years ago but said the divorce has never been a problem.
"When you face so much of your life" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone like him who had experienced similar situations.
The two found a child in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "his vision" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was about 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are things that are more important than the Olympic gold medals.
"My gold medal is Robbie."
Her son has the same name as Robert’s father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept his death and one of the last things he had asked if they had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be.
"I couldn't say, 'I can't play that game'," he said.
"I took him by the hand when he breathed the last time and until he breathed the last and died when I saw that he was also a man like us," he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just realized that this is something I've always wanted for the rest of my life - jumping in front of our people at the Olympic Games, nothing is more than that," he said.
It also made him choose his favorite song - The Heather Small Proud - who has always been in the mind during the time of preparation for the Olympics and starring in the lead.
Desert Island Discs is at BC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson's unfortunate playoffs are held in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson of America will record history on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to upload sacks so that it won't be a disappointing history.
Mickelson, who will play in the event once for 12 years, is set to be held in the batting by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four leagues on Saturday.
Instead of being the lead, as he often led when he played in the United States, the winner of the fifth division twice became a champion and worked in his game hoping to find out what was behind him.
Since he is not a good player to understand the ball even if he is already in the game, the 48-year-old is not suitable for the Wafa Death of the Le Golf National, where the main playground is usually a problem if he hits the ball away.
And if the place to be played is not so bad, Mickelson, who will be playing the ninth game on Sunday, will face Francesco Molinari, a British Open player, who can play with Tommy Fleetwood on their four-wheel wins.
If these Americans, losing four points in the 12 games of one player, start a good game, Mickelson's game can be a cross-country.
Furyk expressed his hope for his brothers, but nothing else is said.
"You're fully aware of the role he plays today, you're wearing me on the shoulder and you're going to be ready for tomorrow," said Ferryk.
"You are very confident.
He is a well-known player and has done a lot in the past, even this week.
I didn't think of him playing two games.
They want to do more, but that's what happened and that's what we think we should do.
"You want to play like everyone else."
Mickelson will re-record the history of Nick Faldo in the most played game in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It's probably his last game in the Ryder Cup that he has never achieved as a player.
Mickelson is still winning 18 times, 20 times he played on the same level, although Furyk says his presence has improved the team.
"It's fun to be with him, he likes to smiling, laughing, he likes to make fun of people, and he's a nice person to be with him in the group room," he explained.
"I think young players have enjoyed being with him, and, in this week, it was good to see you.
There's a lot more to do than just play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leading a lot of things does not mean a lot of things.
Thomas Bjorn, the European Captain, knows that lead with many points if it is taken on the last day of the match at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough game.
Dane played for the first time in the 1997 game in Valderrama, when a team with the Seve Ballesteros led five points over the United States but eventually advanced in one point, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You always remind yourself that they led us in many points in Valderrama; we led many points in Brookline, where we were eaten, and in Valderrama, where we won, but in a few points," said Bjorn, who is in the picture, after watching the 2018 Graduate and the National Graduate win for Lenum on the 5th of July.
So the story will show me and everyone in the group that it is not over.
Do your best in the morning.
Be ashamed and do everything in the right way.
It's not until you get the points.
We have a goal, and you are trying to take this table, and that's what we focus on.
I've already said this, focusing on 12 players in our team, but we know very well what's more about this team - the world's biggest players."
Enjoyed the way his players played at the hardest place to play, Bjorn added: "I've never reached the end of this.
The game of tomorrow is different.
Tomorrow we'll decide how each player will play, and that's a different one.
It's good to go out and play with someone where things go well, but if you play alone, that's where you're completely tested as a golf player.
This is the message you need to send to the players, to do everything you can tonight.
Now, leave the player behind or behind him and he must go and do what he can."
Unlike Bjorn, competitor Jim Furyk will be looking forward to seeing his players play better on their own than they were recorded, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three goals in four.
Furyk himself was able to both eat and win on the last day of the last minute, as he became part of a team that won in Brookline before being eaten when Europe "gagged the wonders in Medina."
"I remember very well," he said when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, urged his players to play on the final day.
"We have 12 important games in the morning, but it would be good to start with a high-speed guitar as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
As the joke and enthusiasm continue to persist, it adds a lot of pressure to those games in the middle of the game.
We've organized our players in accordance with that and we've put our players in a way we think it's going to make us magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been given a job of trying to lead the fight and return to the game and face Rory McIlroy in the lead, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter.
"I'm going to go with this team this way because I think it'll be ready for the whole game," Bjorn said.
The German warship was rebuilt.
A new type of German navy called the Frigate had to start operations in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be available until the next year due to the systems and costs of snowball, reports local journalists.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz commission," the leader of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class franchise, is now being unveiled in the first half of 2019, says Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship had to join Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the money broke down the project's determination future.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that are the only Navy since 2007 will replace Bremen-class ships.
It is understandable that the ships will have a powerful torpedo, the kind of bombs that explode airplanes and vessels and hidden technologies, such as infrared spaces, infrared missiles and anger.
Other important components included include long-term care periods - it is impossible to use new ships until the last two years are in place of shipping from it.
Continuing draft, however, means that the important development of the warships - it will give Germany the power overseas - it will be temporarily lost when it starts to work, says Die Zeit.
The future F125 ship appeared on paper last year, when Germany Navy refused to use the ship and restored it to the Blohmnase-Voss submarine in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy was rebuilt when the ship was made.
There is little known about the reasons for the return of the ship, but German media said there was a lot of trouble with the "Software and Hardware" that makes the warship useless when sent to war.
Software problems are particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be used by a group of 120 pilots - which is part of the old Bremen class crew.
It has also emerged that the ship has a very heavy weight over what is necessary to reduce its performance and reduce the chances that Navy is able to install future improvements.
A ton of 7,000 "Rheinland-Pfalz" believes that it had a double weight of the same ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware problems, the entire project's funding - including the training team of the aristocrats - also became a problem.
It is said to have reached an estimated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 million (<0x24>3.6bn) - from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 million.
The problems of new ships are as important as the recent warnings that the German naval power has decreased.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German chairman of the parliamentary committee, admitted to Navy that he was well "cared for the exit and entrance of unused ships."
The mayor said that the problems had reached 100 over time, since the older ships were no longer functioning but were no longer functioning in place.
He is proud that there are no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that have been able to join Navy.
The National Trust is committed to a life-threatening
A new study in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how insects use the environment where food is toxic.
It is believed that what will be found will help us to understand the way these unusual animals are alive and help us to guide the harvest work in the future.
Scientific research at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common pyestrells and Daubenton pigs with long black ears at the Invereweed Gardens in West Ross.
Special records will be posted in certain areas to check the roles of animals throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will make small surveys using hand-held monitors.
A reasonable analysis of all the recordings will show the flexibility of the cry of the animals and the reaction of certain animals.
The map of the places where they live and the report will be deleted to create a detailed picture of the location of their life.
Rob Dewar, NTS veterinarian advisor, hopes that the results will reveal what areas are most important to the animals and how these animals are used.
This information will help to see the benefits of local management work such as meadow Creation and the best way to preserve livestock and other animal-related areas.
Scotland and the rest of the UK are rare throughout the last century.
They are threatened by the construction and establishment of materials that affect their habitat and the loss of it.
Electricity and lighting machinery can be dangerous, and it can be the same with papers that kill refugees and medications for buildings, as well as attacks on pet cats.
Animals don't really see them.
However, as they hunt at night, their legs are much more effective than their eyes when they catch animals.
They use some complicated skills to learn where the sound comes from to find animals and objects in the area where I live.
The NTS, which has over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the world, considers them important for animals.
It has ten trained technicians, who regularly conduct researches, analyze their habitat and how to protect them.
The organization even organized the Scottish island for the first time and its only pet pets in Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where it resides in eight of Scotland's ten species.
David Thompson says it's a good place to live.
"This is a very good place for animals," he said.
"We have a lot of old buildings, big trees and other beautiful places.
But there's a lot more about the animals we don't know, so the work we do here and other buildings will help us understand more about what we need to survive."
He emphasizes the importance of analyzing the importance of pre-built insects because it is possible to decrease their one-bedroom settlement could kill some 400 females, almost all of them living in that area.
Animals are also protected and the law does not allow them to kill, torture, or disrupt them or undermine their habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish chief of Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to come and help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our pets and most of our species don't know what keeps them alive."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of prosecution as advocates are attempting to pay the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has spoken of the allegations that he has accused him of "false news," saying that people "desperately want to improve themselves" by using his name.
His representatives plan to pay the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The Portuguese actress Juventus is accused of kidnapping a woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is reported that he has paid him <0x24>375,000 to close his mouth on the incident, reports Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram Live and his 142 million followers after hours of reports were reported, Ronaldo, a 33-year-old, said it was "false news."
"No, no, no, no.
What they're saying today is a false news," said a five-minute balloon d'Or camera.
"They're trying to make a name for me.
It is common.
They want to be my name, but it's part of my work.
"I'm very happy and everything's going to be good for me," he added, with a smile.
Ronaldo's representatives are ready to pay Der Spiegel for these charges, calling them "an unacceptable report of cases affecting personal life," said Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would want to pay back "the penalty of his shadow to the extent that he is mostly charged, probably the most serious violation of human rights that has occurred recently."
The incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's room, where it is said to have brought him there, in accordance with the papers placed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was "an ideal person" with "99 percent" errors.
Ronaldo agreed to have sex with each other, but they agreed.
Mayorga also admitted that she went to the police and took pictures of those who were arrested in the hospital, but later she admitted that the case was taken out of court because she felt "feelings of retaliation" and worried about "degradation in the community."
The 34-year-old now wants to make a contract as he continues to be outraged by what is said to be happening.
Ronaldo was still joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the reports, and this year he changed to a large Italian team Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK "will always be sorry" for the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "will always regret" if it loses its position as a leading global leader in the creation of automobiles after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He has also added that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will stop the product for a while in its industry in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a contract," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese designer said the effect of delays on the sidelines when it happens to fail a contract with Brexit could create a loss of jobs.
Burnaston's industry - which makes Auris and Avensis of Toyota - has produced about 150,000 cars last year and 90<0x25> have been exported to other countries in the European Union.
"I think that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March the product will stop in our industry," said Marvin Cooke, a leading Toyota manager in Burnaston.
Some UK automakers have threatened to leave the EU without an agreement on how to trade with other countries to operate, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Min in Oxford after a month of Brexit.
A major concern is what car manufacturers call risks if they are not satisfied with the Brexit agreements.
Toyota's product is operated "according to the needs of the time", auto parts arrive daily after 37 minutes from both UK and EU manufacturers according to audited vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be some disruptions on the sides of the industry that can lead to the break and end of the automotive construction sector.
It's impossible for Toyota to catch more cars that are built on a daily basis in their industry in Derbyshire, says the company, so the product may need to be installed.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plans for future relations with the EU are "prepared to avoid the investigation on the sidelines."
"We need to get a contract. We want to get the best deal that will allow us as not only to succeed now that we will be happy but to take this opportunity," he told Today's BC Radio 4.
"The evidence from not only Toyota but also in other industries is that we need to be fully aware of what is already well-developed by the service providers."
Toyota could not say how long the product will be suspended, but over time, it warns that the demand for expenses will reduce the industry's success and will eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and who is a coordinator of this Unite, says his members are concerned: "That's what I've seen when all these activities are gone.
"We have established a clear and reliable framework for our future relationship with the EU," he said.
The meeting of Trump and Rosenstein may also be delayed, says the White House.
Donald Trump's red-hot meeting with the general presidential candidate Rod Rosenstein may be "opened in one week" as the high court's battle with Brett Kavanaugh's installation continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein leads the work of a special coalition, Robert Mueller, who investigates the interference of Russia's elections, the interaction between Trump and Russia and potential jurisdictions of justice from the president.
Despite Trump’s dismissal of the general representative, in doing so posed a threat to Mueller’s freedom, it has provided Washington with news that could not be discussed for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing a plaque to summarize conversations with Trump and the chance to dismiss the president in a 25-point.
Rosenstein is rare.
But last Monday he went to the White House, although there are reports that he will leave the job.
Instead, meeting Trump, at the time of the United Nations in New York, it was announced that it would be Thursday.
Trump said he was "supported" not to attack Rosenstein but the summit was delayed to be avoided to object to the case of the Senate's judicial committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of rape, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump has announced a one-week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh, which is even more frustrating the Senate's full vote.
Trump's journalist, Sarah Sanders, has appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The day of what has not been postponed, may this week, I think that this will be scheduled for another week as there are other proceedings with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and love to keep the media aware of what's going on."
Some journalists may disagree with this: Sanders has never had a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace has asked why.
According to Sanders, the reduction of these meetings is not due to the media's "love to speak," although he said, "I don't deny the fact that they speak."
He added that the relationship between Trump and the media would be equal.
"The president makes more questions and answers than any other president before him," he said, adding without giving any proof: "We've looked at those numbers."
There will be meetings, says Sanders, but "if the media have the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, that's better than talking to me."
We're trying to do that many times and we've seen it do a lot in the past few weeks and will take the position of the press conference if you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump usually listens to questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or media conferences with respected guests.
It's not unusual to ask questions when you're alone.
New York in this week's president has probably shown why, indifferently, and occasionally speaking in the face of the media.
Health Secretary-General writes to EU employees in NHS in Scotland about what Brexit is afraid of.
The Secretary of Health has written to EU employees working in the NHS of Scotland to express appreciation and national wishes for their stay in the post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MP sent a letter that lasted six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Government of Scotland is already committed to paying the necessary expenses of EU citizens' applications for public assistance.
In his book, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, talks between the UK and the EU have continued, focusing on the decisions expected in the summer.
But the UK government has also been preparing its plans for a non-profit agreement.
I know this may not be the best time for all of you.
That is why I want to emphasize now how much I appreciate the work done by all employees, no matter where they are from.
Our brothers from the EU, as well as in other parts of the world, have brought a valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the healthcare work, benefiting the patients and the communities we work for.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here."
Chrissy Abercrombie is diagnosed with headaches.
Tennessee State Tigers player Chrissy Abercrombie has been treated promptly after a head injury on Saturday when he was deposed on 31-27 by Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State Trainer Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"When you came to the bathroom, you fell to the ground," Reed said.
The coaches and staff of the doctors gave Abercrombie a healthy air in the bathroom before placing it on the stretcher took him back to check it out.
Tennessee State official Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, told reporters that Abercrombie had finished operations at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris is full of "no details about the type/large of damage" and the Tennessee State government is trying to find out when the damage is going on.
Abercrombie, a red student, in his first season with the Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He also scored five times on Saturday before leaving the game, which made a total of 18 times.
Customers in other countries will be paid more than the sum of the unit when purchasing a house in the UK
Customers in other countries will be charged with an extra unit when buying a house in the UK so that this money is used to help those who do not have a residence area under the new Tory programs.
This will make Corbyn's success difficult to find young people to vote.
Increase in the number of taxpayers in the UK
Economists expect about <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Customers in other countries will be charged with a higher-paying unit fund if they buy a house in the UK - this money will be used to help homeless people, Theresa May will announce today.
This will be viewed as an attempt to make it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to succeed in the attempt to attract young people to vote for more affordable housing and to be looked at by people leading a lot of money.
The transfer of funds will apply to individuals and businesses that can not pay taxes in the UK, and this funding will help in the efforts of the Government to end the homeless.
This amount is added - which adds to the current budget of the group, including the highest levels placed in the last two years and sold - about three percent.
The investors expect this to give them about <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of London's rebuilt houses are purchased by non-UK citizens, which increase rates and make it difficult for beginners to find homes.
Many of the rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "towns crying for a drought" because of the high number of foreign customers who spend most of their time out of the country.
A new trend came a few weeks later, Boris Johnson spoke of a reduction in the group's fee to help more youths find first-class homes.
He accused businesses of maintaining high-speed housing prices by taking up the construction site and not using it, and urged Mrs. May to close the quotations in affordable housing to repair the "silence" of Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of proposed changes to the houses, including the management of the rental funds and the termination of the "incorrect" exit.
He also wants to provide more power to build new homes.
Mr. May said: "I've been committed to restoring Britain's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
This means repairing the sales of homes.
Britain will always be ready to welcome people who want to live, work, and build life here.
However, it would be unlikely that non-British people, as well as foreign companies, buy homes than British hardworking citizens.
For so many people the dream of having a home is unrealistic, and the lack of sleep on the street is not over."
Jack Ross: "My greatest desire is to be a Scottish coach"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says he has a "great desire" to be a Scottish coach one day.
Ross, 42, wants a challenge to help the North-East team, now the third in League One, is left in three points by the senior team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after helping St Mirren return to the Scottish Premiership in the previous season.
"I wanted to play the game as a player.
"I got a B cap and that's all right," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden many times when my father was a child, and it has always been something I think about.
I can only get that opportunity, though, if I succeed as a coach of a small team."
The pre-Ross coaches in Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul Di Canio.
Ross, former coach of Alloa Athletic, says he was not afraid to enter the main team, since he rejected applications from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I'm going to say, 'Can I get back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the nature and features of this group, there is no doubt that it should be entered into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to repeat it, but I'll probably consider it as a success where I can get back to this group."
Ross is still only three years as a coach, shortly after being an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
Then she came up with Alloa's escape, and changed St Mirren's almost award to the Champions League in the next season.
Ross says he feels more confident now than when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"The situation has already changed completely," he recalls, training Alloa.
"I was absolutely convinced that the training work was worth me, more than the player.
It sounds unreasonable because I was playing well, healthy, and there are things that I enjoyed.
But playing is not easy.
There are a lot of things you need to do every week.
I still do those things when it comes to work stress and stress, but I love training.
I've been wanting to train for a long time and now I'm doing it, feeling that I'm doing something that I've always wanted to do for the rest of my life as an adult."

In the summer, the British park was heavy, but it was hard for the restaurants.
Groups of pubs and bars have been targeted for 2.7 percent in July - but restaurants have dropped by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of the Bosnian Consultancy CGA, who has achieved these statistics, says: "The continuous success with England's long-term participation in the World Cup means that July follows the same path as the previous month of June, when the pandemic increased by 2 percent.
A 1.8<0x25> drop in sales in restaurants in June has been worse in July.
Bathrooms and restaurants are much more expensive than restaurants.
The pancakes also brought heavy food to the sun, although it wasn't as bad as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want to get rid of it.
"The sale of alcoholic beverages has increased by 6.6 percent this month, and the diet has declined by three percent."
Paul Newman, a reviewer of the joy and hospitality of the RSM, said: "The results continue to go forward since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major events or sports will always be a strong factor when it comes to market sales.
It is not surprising that restaurants continue to push harder, although sales by 4.8 percent each year will be painful despite the ongoing cost problems.
"The hot summer is going to be very bad in food stores and in the long run, the low temperatures we have in August will give us what we need."
An increase in sales figures in restaurants and restaurants, including recent openings, was 2.7 percent in July, showing a decline in cryptocurrency rates.

One in five children has a secret account of their parents' privacy.
One child of five - some 11-year-olds - has a secret account of social networks that hid their parents and teachers, reveals a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in "false" pages in Insta
It's a matter of worrying about pornography.
About 20 percent of people say that they have a "real" account for children.
One in five children - some 11 years old - open social media accounts that hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid growth in "false accounts in Insta" - which refers to the Instagram posting site.
The news creates fears of pornography.
About 20 percent of those who claim to use a clean account are "the best" that they show parents, while they have other privacy.
One mother who somehow saw the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a young man asking others to "slave her."
The study, the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters" and the Headmistress Conference (HMC) in private schools, found 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 with two profiles, and half of them admit that we have nonfiction accounts.
HMC manager Mike Buchanan said: "It's frustrating that so many young people are tempted to build online accounts where parents and teachers would not have found them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "the voice of the players" in the Scottish Athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle is elected by the Scottish Athletics Board as the director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is a Scottish popular player and chairman Ian Beattie describes this act as a good opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his overall experience in games involving other countries over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the UK and all the players in the world and we are confident that sports in Scotland will benefit greatly by bringing him to the board," Beattie said.
"I am determined to be the voice of the players and I hope to contribute a lot and help in guiding the sports in Scotland," says Doyle.
The American player, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games between his four Olympic weights and is now a regular BC professional, found himself unable to walk after the death of the side (TIA).
He wrote on Twitter: "I've been on my side last month.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that I will be able to determine whether or not I will be able to recover.
If it were a gift but I was fully recovered, I learned to walk and today I exercised!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
An advertisement of breast-feeding that compares mothers to cows creates a breakdown on the internet
A breast-feeding company creates a breakdown on the Internet with an advertisement that compares mothers to cows.
In order to mark the installation of what is said to be "the first-haired breast pump in the world," Elvie's client company released a video of a music video that scrape to showcase the freedom of a new pump that provides supportive mothers.
Four mothers sing a song on a cowboy boat with the words, "Yes, I do, but you don't see the tail" and say, "If you haven't seen it, my breasts are not."
He said, "I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill you."
However, this announcement, published on the Facebook page of the company, created an online debate.
The video has been viewed by hundreds of committees, finding different views from viewers, where many say it looks down on the "stress" of the milk industry.
"It's the worst decision to use cows to sell this product.
"It's like they need to get pregnant and have to give birth to milk, unless their children are taken after a few months of birth," he said.
Elvie's breast pump enters into the lungs bar (Elvie/Mom)
"It's a difficult situation for both mother and child," he said.
"Why don't you use a mother's breast milk to protect her children?"
Another said, "This announcement is inappropriate."
Some defended the announcement, and one woman admitted that she found a song "smile."
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have bought it if I hadn't done it.
I felt like a cow and a cow.
I've heard the announcement, but I understand what it means.
This product will be very useful," he wrote.
One has commented: "This announcement is funny and refers to the mothers who make it (usually at work or in private homes) and feel like a cow."
"This is not an advertisement that honors or condemns the milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group that stood still showed that they were dancing with hidden pumps under their bars.
The objective of the campaign is to conclude that many women who use breasts feel like cows.
But Elvie Pump, not angry, has no strings or tubes and wears them under the bra, gives women the freedom to move, carry their children, and take them out of the pump.
Ana Balarin, a partner with the Mother's ECD, has commented: "Elvie Pump is a product that will be very helpful so you deserve a way to advertise it in a clearer way.
By comparing the women with the cows we wanted to put her breasts and all her problems in public, while we express in a way that is pleasant and understandable the feeling of a new pump to manage.
This is not the first time that Elvis's punch has been asked.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children came from the designer's catwalk Martha Jakobowski using this product.
Hundreds of Indigenous children quietly moved to a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of children taken by immigrants has increased even if it has not changed the number of monthly passes by the border, partly because the heavy police station in the Trump office made it difficult to provide supportive children.
Usually, many supporters become unpaid immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their living in this area by identifying themselves as a parent.
This was another accident in June, when authorities announced that no supporters and other adult members in the home will need to send fingerprints, and that data will be provided to the authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the chief executive of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted in front of Congress that the insurgency keeps many people registered to support children with no parents.
The court later admitted that 70 percent of the inmates had no criminal charges.
"About 80 percent of non-profit or family members are illegally here, and the majority of them are criminals.
So we continue to look for those people," said Mr. Albence.
They want to prosecute the children quickly, the authorities set up new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of arrest, not after 60 days, the former law, in accordance with the Shelter workers.
Many will appear on the video conference phone, they will not go literally, in order to appeal to the legal rights of the peers.
Those who are considered incorrect will soon be eliminated.
If the children have been arrested for a long time, there are many opportunities for them to be anxious or depressed, which can lead to an accident or to try to escape, in accordance with the shelter workers and the reports issued from the systems over the past months.
Prosecutors say this concern is growing at a larger institution like Tornillo, where symptoms of a child’s severe drowsiness may not be considered, due to the size of the area.
They also add that transportation of children to the city of the tabernacle without giving them time to prepare for themselves emotionally or to communicate with friends can lead to many disruptions that have already occurred.
Syrians, French, and Turkish forces say they're "invading" quickly.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moullem spoke to Syrian refugees to return home, even if the war in their country is now in its eighth year.
Moullem, who also became the prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally in Syria, saying they would end terrorism, and "they will be treated fairly."
"You have to go fast," he told the audience.
Mouallem has declared that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight this holy war and cleanse the entire region of Syria" from terrorist groups and "everyone from another country."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, focusing on training and managing forces in Kurdish and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in a war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moullem said conditions allow them to return, and blamed "some western countries" for "scaring" that allowed refugees to return.
He said: "We have talked to the international community and the welfare of the people to ensure that the refugees return."
"They're going to be politically motivated only by the people of the world."
The United States and the European Union have warned that it will not help Syria recover until a political treaty between Assad and those who oppose the end of the war.
U.N. officials say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to build a border to build a stronghold of its last major Idlib bridges is an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian and Turkish Agreement prevents a large Syrian military attack by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moulammel insisted that the agreement was "constituted for a clear time" and hoped that soldiers would attack the jihadists and the Nustra Front fighters who were linked with Al-Qaeda, "they will be disbanded."
U.N. Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon organise the first meeting of a new committee that includes government and opposition members to enact the constitution after the Syrian war and organize the election process.
Moualem set limits for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be kept by "looking at the theme of the new constitution," and warned against protests.
Why do you think Trump would have a second chance?
In this sense, Mr Trump can win a second election in 2020 unless, as many non-profit observers may wish to be, untrustworthy and do what is wrong, instead of being president.
It's no doubt that "it's going to be the most historical event in the history of the president!"
Until now, there is no evidence that the viewers are tired of the matter.
Since 2014, CNN's viewers have increased to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's viewers have tripled about 1.6 million.
Fox News typically has 2.4 million viewers, ranging from 1.7 million viewers over the past four years, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC "Rachel Maddow Show" is the leading target for over 3.5 million viewers in hot nightclubs.
"People are curious because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama programme called "Designed Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who is president after the attack on Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a red-covered "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another view.
He recalled a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why did he ask me?
"Because you're laughing at me," said Mrs. Scovell.
It's fun to listen and watch these events.
Of course, unlike any other TV, the news from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, regardless of whether family members are reunited and have a global economy.
Very few people are not aware of these issues.

When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was hot at 80 degrees out of his home in the north of Kauai, but he was inside the house watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
It did not allow him to leave before it, as Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court is uncertain.
"I remember from ancient times we do all these crazy programs and people say, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was funny, but it seemed right."

Financial funds are selected in the middle of the home competition
It is no surprise that 17th to 17th to the 17th to the financial year, due to the re-establishment of the two congress districts from which two managers were intertwined with the same seat.
The Pittsburg region's latest graphics featured in the Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another region in a special election in spring last year.
Lamb is currently competing with another volume, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the 12th old Pennsylvania region, which runs through a total of 17th-century youth.
The maps were re-created after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old provinces violated the constitution by having voted for the Republicans.
The competition in this new 17-year-old has eliminated the financial campaign competition between members of a large group, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb was popular in Pennsylvania after winning a special election in March which was observed by many of the Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
For more than a decade, President Donald Trump won the stadium with 20 polls.

The U.S. decided to punish El Salvador with China's support, and then resigned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have long recognized Beijing, with a small request from Washington.
President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and became a hotel in Panama until they removed the Trump Administration's leadership team.
The authorities of the State Department have decided to again call the U.S. diplomatic missions of El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about "the latest decision to not cooperate with Taiwan," Heather Nauert, spokesman at the door.
But El Salvador was only paid for <0x24>140 million by helping the United States in 2017, as well as controlling narcotics, development and economic support.
The payment proposed, which includes financial aid cuts and distributed restrictions on visas, which could have caused the pain of Central America due to the increase in job losses and killings.
As their meetings progressed, officials in North America and Central America sparked a high summit focused on protecting and developing the economy in order to follow the same summit last year that was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior management officials made it clear that they wanted a congress, effectively ending any view of El Salvador’s penalties.
President Mike Pence's goal is now to prepare for talks and conferences, now scheduled to be in mid-October, as a signal to the authorities at the meeting, officials said.
Three U.S. representatives return peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new powerful messages or penalties from Washington.
The White House spokesman of Mr. Bolton rarely refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two angels, who agreed to discuss internal intentions about privacy.
Their accounts are verified by an external analyst close to the administrators and spoke about the privacy situation.
A Lesson in History
The following event may be a report of Robert Mueller's special counselor in opposition to Mr. Trump's justice, and now there is strong evidence of the public record.
Mr. Mueller is said to be investigating whether Mr. Trump has joined Russia in its efforts to attack our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will find himself facing trial on this stage, as he prepares for the standing before voters, and possibly at the end of the court.
This has a lot of issues, and I don't say that Mr. Trump's fall will certainly happen - or his relatives in Europe.
There are decisions we all need to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the conflict.
In 1938, German authorities were ready to set up a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West was against him and supported the Czechoslovakian in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of blood transfusion.
History revolves around these events, and the unlimited efforts to fight the will of the people are either strong or inefficient.
The United States is facing many of these situations.
What will we do if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, a man who manages the investigation by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the paper reported that, last year, he proposed to record the president privately and spoke of his failure to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story of The Times is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or incorrect - or if he is put in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual abuse and false witnessing?
And above all, will we vote in the middle of Congress to accuse Mr. Trump?
If we fail to do so, the will of the people will not last long.
I don't think I'll fail because of what I've learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz the same Nazi empire that once ruled my place.
He survived, moved to the United States, and, after 60 years, he sent me to light the candles on a swastika table.
I have that as an inheritance, how can I have no hope for the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is looking forward to the game with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers play at home with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning the Austrians, after playing equally in Spain and Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to pass the Europa League.
The injury on the shoulder prevents abdominal player Graham Dorrans from playing for the first time in the pain until they played equally 2-2 with Villarreal but believe that Rangers can use those results to focus on big things.
"It's a good idea to get this game because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We're going to the game and hopefully we get something back.
We may have found a golf course at the end but, rather, playing equally well as well.
They were better than us in the first place, and the second time we played better.
On Tuesday, we played another European game.
We hope that we will get three points but it will be a tough game because they played well in the previous game but, because our followers will be encouraging us, I'm sure we will play and get good results.
Last year, all the things that have happened to my injury and change in the team itself, but it seems that things are going well now.
The team is good and the players are happy; it's fun when training.
We hope that we will be able to do it now, and we will be successful in the past."
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of the money.
Although researchers had a clear view of their needs, few people spoke to their families about it.
Nearly half of the population in the National Research say they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they talk to their children about it.
"People want to take care of a family member, but they don't take steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, president of the National Insurance Insurance Agency.
Let's get started.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You can't prepare your family for care if you don't tell your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss how and where you will get care, since those decisions can have a major impact on the cost.
Tell your financial adviser: Your counselor can also help you with how to pay those expenses.
Your long-term financial decisions may include a long-term care insurance policy, a lifesaving insurance policy that provides you with money if you apply so that you can pay for these costs or be your health insurance - as long as you have money.
Remove your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Find a health care practitioner so that you can take care of your medical needs and make sure that your doctors are consistent with your wishes if you can't speak.
Also, consider the power of an attorney in your money.
You will choose someone you trust to make decisions about your money and make sure that your expenses are paid if you can't do anything.
Don't forget the small details: Think about your elderly parent who is suffering from an emergency medical condition and is transported to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about drugs and alcohol?
Write down the details in order to prepare for the situation.
"It's not just the money to be considered, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.

Palu and Donggala have been attacked by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Disaster Mitigation Agency of Indonesia.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and laid down hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Tsunami also attacked West Donggala in 1996, killing 9 people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some areas that have been affected by a massive earthquake and tsunami in recent years:

Government prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for the victim of a terrorist attack in NYC
Prosecutors in New York sought the death sentence of Sayfullo Saipov, a New York City terrorist prosecutor who killed eight people - a rare case that has never been released from the crime area since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old, is said to have used a rented Home Depot truck to attack the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and bicycles on that road by Oct.
In order to be able to report the murder, the protesters will have to show that Saipov killed eight people with "muggled" and "muggled" severe physical injuries, in accordance with the announcement of an attempt to obtain a death sentence, published by the Southern District of New York.
Both cases have the weight of the death sentence, in accordance with the court's jurisdiction.
A few weeks later, the trial court filed 22 cases of Saipov including eight murders, often used by government agents on the sides of the crime scene, and the crime and trafficking.
The attack had to be "prepared and thought-provoked," said the protesters, explaining how Saipov made it "bad, cruel and frustrating."
"Sayfullo Habillulaevic Saipov killed, killed the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferrunzo, and Hernan Menundo"
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
Ten years have passed since the Southern District of New York ended up holding a death sentence.
The prosecutor, Khalid Barnes, was charged with murdering two drug workers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the execution of a death sentence near New York was in 1953 in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, married couples who were killed after being found guilty of stealing information during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in a power seat on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has demonstrated that he has no heart in the days and months following the attack, according to court authorities.
He told the investigators that he was well aware of what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that something had caused him to attack in this way to watch videos on ISIS on his phone, in accordance with what he said next.
He also called for an ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital ward, police said.
He said he was not in the 22nd position.
David Patton, a social defender who defends Saipov, says they are "slow as expected" by court decision.
"We think that the decision to seek a death sentence rather than accept the application of a prison sentence without the time of release will only be easier to scare these incidents for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team called on the prosecutors not to seek a death sentence.
The Minister of Tory says that NIGEL FARAGE should direct talks with Brexit.
Nigel Farage has vowed to "classify a human army" today during a raid on Tory.
The former Ukip leader said that politicians had to be "understood" by the Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's ministers said he should be the EU's leader.
President Peter Bone said the UK's "should have left" if Mr Farage was Brexit's Secretary-General.
But Mrs. May's challenge is to gather members of his various teams was marked by older members of Tory joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is unable to maintain his Chequers' retreat system despite the Brexit, Remainers and EU attacks.
Other members insisted that he will continue to strive to make a treaty with Brussels despite the dispute there - and to end the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his 'authority' package.
Mr Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to "end with Chequers."
Mr. Farage said he had to be made of sand and given work to negotiate with Brussels.
"If you were the boss, we would have been out now," he said.
The Minister of Wellingborough added: "I'll stand for Brexit but we'll have to finish with Chequers."
He said: "We have not fought the wars of the world in order to be slaves.
We want to make our own rules in our country."
Mr Bone has issued a statement that the public view has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to remain untrue."
Andrea Jenkyns of Tory's supporter Brexit was also in the scene, telling the boxers: 'What I'm saying is, Chief Minister, listen to people.
"People who don't want Chequers, the opposition party won't vote, our group doesn't want our people to see them on the streets and make us vote from the very beginning.
Please don't forget to listen to Chelsea."
In the courtroom, Mrs. May said, "The Prime Minister continues to do their work if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told politicians in a statement that they should be "pressed" if they forget the decisions they made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of loyalty between us - people - and our political party," he said.
"They're trying to be dishonest in Brexit and we're here today to tell them, 'We won't let you do that.' "
In a powerful garden, he told the crowd: "I want to make political parties, now in danger of Brexit, they feel pressured.
"We use the people of this world who have won the Brexit and will never lose power and become a independent, self-governmental, a proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Remainers raided Birmingham before a two-hour call in the city.
The main archbishops held the Tories Against Brexit after the group's suspension this week.
Labour member Lord Adonis made fun of Consservatives on the security issues they had with the group's app at the opening of the conference.
"These people tell us that they can place systems on IT and all the Canadian technologies and so on, a problem-free border, free trade without borders with Ireland," he added.
"It is completely destroyed.
"There's nothing like Brexit," he added.
Warren's plans to "consider" the presidential election
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she "will consider entering the presidential election" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about its future at a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is constantly criticizing President Donald Trump, joins a re-election in November against the GOP Rep. Geoff Diehl, the country's assistant to Trump in the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been on his way to win the Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke became his 36th meeting using a city hall since Trump became president.
The person who decides to make a decision.
Warren responded that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that includes a woman who will be president."
The rapper killed the LSU actress Sims.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., have announced on Saturday that he has been detained and killed an LSU basketball player, Wayde Sims, on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department has announced that the arrest of Dryteon Simpson, aged 20, was held at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
We released a video showing this disruption on Friday, asking for help to explain the man who appeared in the interview.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, 247 sports.

Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton arrives to win the World Cup after following the leadership of the team that led him to defeat Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas successfully passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's guidelines would play a major role in the competition.
From the start, Bottas started well and probably competed with Hamilton as he defended his place in the first two seasons and invited Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first entered the pits and left Hamilton to be hanged on the team's neck, which was to be the decision.
Mercedes entered the pit after the round and became behind Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead after a wrestling made Ferrari's driver to be forced to leave the inside without danger after two years of defense in the third quarter.
Max Verstappen started on the back of the grill and became the seventh at the end of the first round on his 21th birthday.
He then led a large part of the competition as he continued his sleeves in order to catch the finish quickly and pass Kimi Raikkonen to fourth.
He finally reached the pits in the 44th round but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen was on Thursday.
It's been a very difficult day for Valtteri to do a good job on weekends and be kind to me.
"The team has done a complimentary job with 1-2," Hamilton said.
His body's movement is rich
President Donald Trump laughed at Senator Dianne Feinstein in a Saturday's plea as he insisted that he did not show a letter from Christine Blasey Ford to the High Court prosecutor Brett Kavanaugh on charges of sexual harassment.
Speaking at the West Virginia MP, the president did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate's judiciary committee, instead he noted that what happened to the Senate showed that people were "inconscient and untrustworthy."
"One thing that could happen with a good thing going on a few days ago in the Senate, if you see anger, when you see people who are angry and unkind and unconscious," he said.
"When he looked at the news, he said, 'Oh, I didn't.
I hadn't done it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, tell you?
You remember the answer... someone sent you to the department - "Oh, ooh, what?
Oh, no.
He didn't send me."
Wait for a minute.
"We didn't send a message to anyone," he said, referring to the senator.
Feinstein was sent to a document about Kavanaugh's allegation by Ford back in July, and it appeared in early September - but Feinstein denies that the government leaves his office.
"I didn't hide the claims of Dr. Ford, I didn't send anyone," Feinstein told the committee, reports The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I've kept it secret just as I asked him to do."
But his rejection did not sound well to the president, who commented during a Saturday night's meeting: "Here's what I say, his body movement is rich.
He probably didn't do it, but his body movement was rich."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court, accused of three women for fraud, the president said Democrats used accusations in their favors.
"He is determined to do whatever he can.
"He sees the lack of kindness, carelessness, who doesn't care about who is hurting, who should go through to control and control," the media said in a statement from the president.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in the Giants game with Dundee.
The Dundee Stars return after being played on Friday in the Elite League with the Belfast Giants by winning the next game on 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two goals at the start of the game with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie beat the team's ratings at home before Dwyer raped the Third Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored a Dundee rating before Lucas Lundvald Nielsen scored two winners.
This was the third time Adam Keefe's team was played in the Elite League in the season, as they were once again winning Friday night and beat Dundee at 2-1 in Belfast.
The teams had met for the fourth time in the season, and the Giants won the last three games.
Dwyer's first goal scored in the fourth minute at 3:35 when the ball was set from Kendall McFaull, which was played by David Rutherford while Beauvillier scored the second goal four minutes later.
In a multi-year game at the beginning, Sullivan gave hope to the team he played at home at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt sent a ball to Cownie when he beat you in 15:16.
Dwyer has estimated that Giants are moving forward when they are caught in a café when he hits his second goal that day at the end of the first round.
The team that played at home was back in power, and Bouchard also beat the best score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran have come together to help Nielsen beat Dundee's lead guitar for the first time in the game at the end of the second season and estimate that they will win the game by winning the fifth match if you finish the game.

Airline, which directs the Pacific lagoon airline in Micronesia, now says that there is one missing person, after all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from an airplane.
Air Niugini has said that since Saturday afternoon, he will not be able to report on a man's passenger.

Analyst reveals the night of a woman's life
The prosecutor charged on Saturday with a firearm woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for many hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used telephone records to find places where a 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and a 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, died on the night of his death.
Rowlett said he found information about the location of several phones that showed that Tellis had Chambers on his death afternoon, in opposition to what he said earlier, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When details indicate that his phone was on-screen Chambers during the time he had a friend he was; he, Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stood before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the protesters asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he "shocked because his truck was in Nashville."
There is also a saying that Tillis knew Chambers two weeks before he died.
Telephone records indicate that they were dating for one week.
Rowlett says some time before Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chamber's emails, phone calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He took her out of her life," said Hale.
The prosecutor is scheduled to start talking on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to appear in the courtroom of the jury that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious hip hop?
This hip hop group seeks to challenge the negative views of this genre of music by filling its songs with encouraging words.
High Breed, from Bristol, says hip hop is not the only thing that was originally the result of having political messages and talking about social problems.
They want to get back to the hip hop and then make a renowned hip hop.
Musicians such as The Fuges and Commons have seen later increases in the UK in rankings such as Akala and Lowkey.

A child's guard in NY accuses parents of dismissing him with a message that shows "discrimination"
A New York child's guard accuses a man and his wife of dismissing him with prejudice after receiving a message from the mother of a child who is mistakenly "is another black man."
The parents denied that they were prejudiced, saying the allegations were made "for the purpose of earning money."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who has two children, has expressed concern when she discovers that she will take care of her youngest child, Giselle Maurice, a black man when she arrives on the first day of her career in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MANY PEOPLE," writes Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After seeing his boss, the "free" Plasco-Flaxman interviewed Mrs. Maurice, who said that the caretaker of his children who loved to travel, an African-American, did an unpleasant job and that he was expecting a Filipino man, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then sent home by Uber.
Currently, Maurice accuses parents of unjustly dismissing her, and she seeks a <0x24>350-month summary, and a live-in gig that she has not been recognized, without a contract.
"I wanted to show them that, look, they weren't done that," he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know you're discrimination."
The parents responded that they were prejudiced, saying that dismissing Maurice was a good thing they had done, fearing that they would not trust him after he treated her badly.
"My wife told me something that wasn't right.
He does not discriminate.
"We don't see the people who hate you," said Joe Plasco, who told the post.
"But can you leave your children with someone who is green with you, even if it's wrong?
What's your new baby?
Of course."
Comparing this charge with "the benefit of earning money," Plasco says his wife had been having a baby for two months and was "in very difficult situations."
"You're going to attack such a person?
"It's not a good thing," the investment bank added.
As the case goes on, the public opinion court is quick to blame the parents on social networking sites, not encouraging what they did.
Paddington publishers were afraid that the readers would not like this report, revealing the newspaper.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born after the book was loved, said in a book: "It's hard to put the shoes of the person you read for the first time before it was published.
It's good to know what we know about Paddington's success."
He said his father, who worked in the BC as a photographer before he was moved to write a book about a small toy bag, which he would not have planned if his job was unpopular, added a 60th anniversary of the printing of his books was "hard and fun" after he said it.
Regarding Paddington, he described him as "the most important member of our family," adding that his father did not recommend his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not proud," he said.
"But because Paddington was real to me, it was like if you had a child who did something: you're proud of it even if it doesn't work for you.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success in that way.
Even if it was founded by him and it was thought by him, he had experienced the praise of Paddington."
My daughter died and I had to call her by phone.
When her daughter was rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, the doctors worked hard to save her life.
"Nad always called and said it was too bad, saying he didn't expect to survive," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"I've got a phone call from Nad that he's going to die two minutes from now and I've had to tell him.
And I proclaimed it.
I said, "I love Tahiti, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The clothes that the doctors gave her to keep her heart battling slowly, and she was bleeding from the body.
He died some time earlier, and this had stopped working.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing that all of this had happened.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really needed to keep it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now weeping for her dead daughter, flying with other passengers - apparently because of the sad situation she faced.
"Nobody knows," he told them.
"I looked at the ground, and my tears were always gone.
It's hard to explain, but it's time to fly when I'm saddened by Nad.
He needed my love and understanding of me.
I know how much she loved him."
A woman scrapes cards to prevent suicide in the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide work together to prevent suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were doing this on the Welsh bridge with encouraging words and phone numbers that people could use to get help.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the same way I feel every day," Mrs. Davis said.
Mrs. Davis, a 45-year-old living in Lydney, says his son was a promising future cook and when everyone had a smile.
"Everybody knew about her smile.
"They always told me that it's all good."
However, he quit his job before he died, as he was "very depressed."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, became the first person to find him after his suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I'm always worried about something that's going to happen.
Mrs. Davis began making cards, "to inform people that there are people who can talk to them, even if they are friends.
"Don't hold your breath - you have to talk."
Mrs Humphreys, a friend of Mrs. Davies for many years, lost his 15-year-old brother Mark, just after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt low or depressed or said something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a different way of doing things.
He said that on Christmas Day he was down in another way - when children open their gifts, he did not look at them or do anything."
He said that his death was very oppressive, but they had to deal with it: "It opened a big hole in the family.
It causes a lot of pain.
We all have to keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is not guaranteed as the FBI starts the investigation.
"I thought, if we really could find something like what they wanted - a quick, inexplicable investigation - we could bring a devastating union," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee would "subscribe" as many of the supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The problem is due to time.
The internal election and time will arrive in five churches, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans fail, then they will be weakened in their efforts to find someone who wants to be elected to the highest court in this case.
George W. Bush has been calling on the Senators, who encouraged him to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and there he met his wife, Ashley, who was the secretary-general of Mr. Bush.
What happens when the FBI cancels its report?
There will be a Senate election, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh would get 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the president's candidate, to separate the equality and put him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's "decreases" under Kim
The number of cases in North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un began ruling seven years ago, a South Korean law expert said.
Park Byeong-seug, quoted the Southern Communications Department's report, said 1,127 cases last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park says border laws are established between North Korea and China and the high costs required by workers who are in charge of low-income workers have a significant impact.
Pyongyang has not commented on the public.
A large number of North Koreans have the right to be citizens of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled to China, with a long border linking North Korea and it is easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) with protection between two Koreans.
China considers these as illegal immigrants, not refugees and retaliation to their countries in general.
The relationship between the North and the South - still in a sense - has been significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the establishment of nuclear weapons talks.
This was after a historic June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on several ways to end nuclear weapons in Korea.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho has accused U.S. authorities of not taking action since.
"Unless the United States is confident, there will be no hope for the safety of our country and under those circumstances, we will never close our own weapons first," Mr Ri said in a statement at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "regulated emotions," which he says is unsuitable for working in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Little House Party Nancy Pelosi called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh for "regulating feelings" and said his feelings did not allow him to work in the Supreme Court.
In an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, Texans.
"I just thought that if a woman did the same thing, it would be called 'under control of emotions,'" Persia said in response to Kavanaugh's statements before the Senate judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied being influenced by feelings that he has falsely accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford of childhood.
During his first words, Kavanaugh spoke expressing feelings, in some cases discouraging and frustrated when discussing his family and his high school years.
He also quoted Democrats from the committee, calling the allegations of "the execution of personal information in an orderly manner to be executed" which is organized by the suspects that Hillary Clinton was defeated in the 2016 election.
Perosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's evidence suggests that he will fail to work in the Supreme Court, as it indicates that he is against the Democrats.
"I think you're inappropriate about those words and how he spoke about the Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
When asked whether he would try to accuse Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and that Democrats find many seats at the House of Representatives.
"This is what I'm going to say - if I don't speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, it means that he is not only qualified to the Supreme Court, but also to his court at the moment," said Persian.
Kavanaugh is currently a jury at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi has added that as a Democrat he is concerned that Kavanaugh may judge against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is thought to be a reasonable judge.
When asked, Kavanaugh did not answer questions as to whether he could answer certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for an emotionally controlling person to go to court and is expected to say, 'That's fine,'" Persian said.
Women also need to use their powers.
Suitable comments, months and years of burning anger, and there is no other way to get rid of them without crying.
"We're crying when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me that 45 years later.
"I don't think that's normal, what do you say?"
She adds: "I heard a woman who was driving the train, who said she was crying when she was upset, but she got the idea that when she got up and cried, she said to a person who spoke to her, "You might think I was hurt because I was crying.
I'm angry."
Then he continued.
And I thought it was good."
Tears come out as a means of removing anger because they need a lot of people.
One of my memories of my first job, a man-made office, when I found myself crying out because of an angry reaction I couldn't explain, I was pulled into the back of the neck - an uninjured manager who was always afraid of me - he threw me down the stairs.
"They don't see you crying," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're hurt and they'll be happy because they've found you."
Patricia Schroeder, who became a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during the election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was arrested on a ship called the Monkey Business and was elected, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, saw that he would not fulfill his desire to enter the presidential election.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said 30 years later.
"There have been more than seven others in the competition, and it's a joy to wait for the other one again.
One is called "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because he had ended the campaign, he had no money to play, so he vowed that he would not enter the competition and earn <0x24>2 million.
It was a war I could not win.
He found that some of his supporters who gave him <0x24>1,000 million to men could give him <0x24>250.
"Do they think I'm going to get rid of it?" he asked.
During his speech, he declared that he would not make a planned campaign, he was emotioned - an appreciation of the people he had supported, the frustration of the system made it harder for the merger of money and seeking voters to vote than for members, and the anger of women's discrimination - he put them there.
"You might think I'm still in it," recalled Mrs. Schroeder and how the media responded to him.
"You may think that Kleenex will be a puppy.
What do I think they'll put in my grave?
"Did you sleep?"
How the trade war between the U.S. and China can be beneficial in Beijing
The samples that open the trade war between the U.S. and China shut the ears, and as the war is far from the end, the interaction between these countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the future, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. President, issued the first warning earlier this year by filing supplies sent to China, including electrical, metal, and aluminum.
The largest incident in this week's event was with new topics affecting <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), by filing half of all imported goods from the United States from China.
Beijing has repeated each time in the same way, recently placed between 5 and 10 percent of American goods worth <0x24>60 billion.
China has asked it to be equivalent to the United States of America, and the second largest economy in the world has little chance of being soon.
To make Washington a good vibe means to close the bank with its own needs, but public transportation in the U.S. can be very embarrassing to <0x58>i Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, researchers say that if Beijing could act wisely, the pressure to trade with the U.S. might reap China for a long time by reducing the cooperation of both devices.
"The fact that the rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that can cause economic problems in both countries are far more dangerous than those that observers have seen in the past," said Abigail Grace, a focus researcher in the Asian Center for New America.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to return voluntaryly to the refugees and seek help to rebuild the world of war that lasted seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulam said the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation is calm and safe because of the progress made against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to reorganize the pesticides in order to restore normal life.
All circumstances now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to a land where they had to flee because of the terrorism and economic laws that have threatened their daily lives and lifestyle.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the outbreak of the war in 2011.
Some 6 million people still live in this area needing life’s help.
Al-Moullem said the Syrian government could enjoy the help of rebuilding the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept help or help from countries that supported the revolt.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the U.S. League with 16.5 points - 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.

It was a difficult year.
Thank you for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so glad I found it again.
"We work for the team., and I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after winning Europe.
He transitions to his own character John Ram who defeated the U.S. golf club Tiger Woods in 2<0x26>1 on Sunday.
"I'm really proud of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has been eliminated from all four of his games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record of the Ryder Cup.
The rare figures of one of the most famous players in history, who won 14 major leagues, are only second in Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team takes heavyweight on weekends to win the fairways except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a high-level game during the competition.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk has said after his team's bad game, "I'm proud of our players, they're working.
It was early in the morning when we were in Europe.
We failed.
He worked with Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 players played well.
We'll fix it, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll continue to do so.
I love the 12 players and I am proud to be a captain.
You have to advise your boss.
We have been defeated."
Red Tide: Numbers decreased in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a decline in the Red Tide figures in parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, different product differences are reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier areas - which may indicate a decrease in numbers.
Red Tide production grows about 130 miles [130 km] on the coast from the north of Pinellas to the south of the Lee areas.
Differences are found about 10 miles from Hillsborough County, but in a few locations last week.
Red Tide has also been found in Pasco County.
Statistics that have not entered the area or from the coast of Pinellas County have been posted last week, low to high figures from the shore of Hillsborough County, and later to the highest numbers in the county of Mangate County, and later to the lower levels of the county and county of the county.
respiratory disorders continue to be reported in Pinelas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier's.
The respiratory disorder was not reported in Northwest Florida last week.
