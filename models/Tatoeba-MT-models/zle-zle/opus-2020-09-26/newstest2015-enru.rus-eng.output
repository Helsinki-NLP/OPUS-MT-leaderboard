FANO Russia will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will hold with RAN the third Expert Session “Assessment of the Efficiency of Scientific Organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in the press release issued by Lenta.Ru.
The third meeting is scheduled to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for a year and to establish the outcome list of indicators for assessing the impact of scientific organizations.
Participants are planning to discuss rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of scientific teams and criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in the list of events to create a unified approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the impact of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have been able to do so, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
Following the nearest session, we must complete the development of science- and expert analysis processes, agree on stages and dates of evaluation”, said the Chief of the FANO Research and Analysis Office of the Russian Federation, Helena Axenov.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
It is expected that the resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. by Moscow Time on 16 September 2014, at Moscow City, Solank Street, House 14.
Scientists Found a Way to Find Related Stars
Astrophysics at the University of California in Santa Cruz learned the turbulence and its impact on chemical uniformity in star strips.
The discovery of professionals is expected to allow the search for relative stars, that is, the ones that emerge from one cluster.
The authors published their studies in the Nature magazine and are briefly available on the university website.
The same chemical composition of the nearest stars is caused by turbulent mixing in the gas clouds that precede the formation of the stars.
Even if the star is then left by the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine its birth place and the fertile star region.
Earlier, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The modelling results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputers modelled two inter-start gas flows that formed clouds together.
This object has been converted into a cluster for several million years under its own gravity, where protostars begin to form.
Scientists added paint marks to the initial gas flows and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud has reached a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysics believe that their research proves that chemical-producing stars can be found and that possible regions of the establishment of such facilities can be identified.
Carrata police arrested 20 years after the high-speed motorcycle was over.
The motorcycle was confiscated after travelling at a speed of 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed zone and through the Bushland to escape from the Pilbar police.
The Carrata transport police patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that it was about 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgait Road.
The police reported that the motorcycler had not stopped and continued the movement on Berjes Rood, then turned him down to Bushland, leaving the police out of sight.
The motorcycle and the driver's description were observed near the house at Walcott Way in Bulgar.
The Carrata Police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He must be brought before the Carrata World Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not "burse the door" for new sanctions and will not get out of WTO
Russia will not "burst the door" in connection with new sanctions.
This has been said today by Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of IGMO.
With regard to our responses to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasize, because everything should be specifically calculated, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like to do for this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be linked to the striking of doors, some insults, falsely understood,' emphasized the Minister.
We will, first of all, be distracted from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, the social sphere, our citizens, our business, and we will draw conclusions from the actions of the partners to ensure their adequacy, capacity and reliability.
On what steps are being taken in the area of sanctions, it is very good to see what partners are doing, - continued by the head of the MID RF.
If the whole voice says that "these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we're forced to go to punish Russia," it's probably not very adequate."
With regard to the WTO's withdrawal of the RF in response to possible new sanctions, there is no.
On the contrary, we would like to learn more about the WTO instruments, including when trade disputes are in question, said Lavrov.
We have already used this instrument to overcome, we believe, the discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of demping and is also using anti-dumping measures against sectors of the economy of the RF.
“We are prepared to use WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying EU third energy package rules retrospectively”, said Lavrov.
How do you use the cheese properly in the garden design?
Irina Okunev answers:
Since cheese loses its predominant attraction, it is desirable to plant together with other shrubs.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
The plants that are decorative and flourishing at the same time can and must be planted alongside the cheese.
Another plus raw is that it gives a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it as a strained tree of different heights, a better bush, a bush with wide ground, and even a likeness of a garden bonsai, a tree with a fascinating trunk.
Just select the form that's more consistent with your garden design.
In Karelia, the resident of the Leningrad region is convicted of the sale of false money.
As reported in the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonetsk and Segez districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already inherited the Volojetic region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years in the spring of this year.
Later, the man was brought before the Olonsky District Court.
In order to complete the investigation into crimes committed in our Republic, it was phased into Segeju.
In the course of the investigation, the blame was proved for a number of fraudulent sales related to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, criminal proceedings with indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment with four years in the general regime.
The verdict did not enter into legal force.
Remember, in the past week, two more counterfeiters were convicted of paying their money in Petrozawovask stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also arrived in Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four years.
Every person has a fine of 500,000 roubles.
The verdict has also not yet entered into force.
In Arhanguelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy Deerves.
The meeting held at the district centre was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Derves delivered military assistance to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Archangelsk, a monument of the northern convoys, located on the coastal name of Cedova, in Solubal, took place at the stork of the future stone.
The event was attended by representatives of the veteran organizations of Arhanguelsk, children from the cadet class.
For the first time, we gathered twenty-three years ago when we laid a cotton stone.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned the sea," said the president of the Council of the North Sea Veterans of Boris Carpov.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and cadet veterans were given flowers and sailed with Russian flags and a sign of victory.
The meeting ended with the placing of flowers on the cotton stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formed boots, tin, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and armaments were also on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Kharrickane fighters in dismantling state.
At the same time, the convoy was escorted to 16 British IMF ships, including two airborne carriers.
The vessels were not discovered by an opponent and were safely reached the destination of Arhanhelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravans, 126 ships and about 50 military vessels were killed.

The following year, participants are planning to be represented at the Russian level, reports a press service to the Urban Administration.
Reminding the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
The Congressmen Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill on which the organization of trade unions is protected as a civil right.
"Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, co-chairing the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Act on Employee Empowerment along with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement by John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities in the context of discrimination against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents
The amendment of the Labour Regulatory Act to allow workers facing discrimination for participation in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis, and the sponsors of the bill is to recall a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have been attacked in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that still remembered millions of Americans when that country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that the Hideki Todze paramilitary autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize and to negotiations and collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by strong democracy.
Acknowledging that workers would need to be organized and heard in a new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to infringe this right would not have legal effect; measures aimed at that purpose would be considered illegal.
When the former Lady Eleonor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, the World Declaration on Human Rights, to be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the constituent included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests”.
The U.S. generations have adopted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the force of the nation but has increased them.
By raising the standard of living of millions, trade unions miraculously created the market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the promotion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - are long overdue.
Kit Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically expanded America and made democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the Law of Louisiana, about which his supporters say he would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Jinadal in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who are making abortions would have been obliged to have the authority to receive patients at the hospital in a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that, to date, doctors can continue to make legal abortions by continuing to seek such authority.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to obtain authority”, wrote in his decision Judge John de Grewells.
The hearing will be appointed during the month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion gladly met this decision, the last in the list of decisions against similar measures, saying that it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
“The present decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortape, the President and the head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a claim for the stay of the law from the person of three of the five state clinics.
It was not clear immediately whether the decision applied to the doctors of the two clinics who had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana belongs to 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and the Mission.
The key parts of the Texas Law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the Federal Judge on Friday.
Bordies for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on the powers of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medicine.
Abuse opponents object to such measures to protect women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who makes abortions in Louisiana has the authority to receive hospitals reported to the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop the procedure, the doctor, fearing his safety, would have stopped the procedure, reported to the group.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors while their applications for decision-making were pending.
Towards the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the trade networks should be Russian production, considers Oleg Neil's deputy of the Gosduth from the “Russia Justice” faction.
The Parliamentarians have drafted a bill aimed at introducing protection measures against domestic producers, reports the newspaper “Envestment”.
The document will be further elaborated to avoid a possible discomfort for buyers.
This relates to goods that are not produced in Russia, and for the rest of the products produced in Russia, the Rheiler will have to provide at least half of its shelves to the domestic producers,” reported Neil.
In addition to the amendments to the article “On the basis of public regulation of trade activities in the RF”, the bill provides for a change in the Tax Code, which establishes a 10 per cent low rate of VAT in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the trunks.
However, the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, the experts said.
According to the lawyer of the Talovik, an independent expert centre of the Public Mind, Sergei Litwinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will lead to growth.
They'll also be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means they're going to grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, since they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase their activities and sales, resulting in higher taxes than before.
This will increase the revenues of the budget, create new jobs, some industries will start expanding, somewhat faster learning, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, but not at once," the expert observes.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to use local shops because of high competition by foreign analogies.
Now, after the embargo, this niche has been released and can be sighed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, after all necessary harmonization and sanitary checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be delivered.
In other words, it's "the moment of silence," when the former players are gone and the new ones are not yet here.
Almost a month later, there was an increased demand for domestic raw materials and an increase in the prices of finished products,” said Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian Public Organization, the Russian Club of Finance Directors, by Tamara Cassianova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would strengthen the sector with local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are cheaper from subsidies from another State.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will be developed between companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kassianova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of fellow countrymen in a way that is far from all the articles.
In this situation, trade networks will have to “take” the proportion of Russian goods to half of the assortimant.
As a result, there is an increasing fear that poor goods will be delivered to the stalls.
It is possible that foreign products with overlapping labels will be supplied under the type of products produced in Russia," adds the expert.
Large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers, are negatively affected by the introduction of quotas.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer from such a pattern, as demand for their products will decline.
Lithuanianenko does not preclude that the domestic product quotas law may affect consumers.
The point is that some Russian production products can proceed with import analogies, while shops can accuse prices for the second, as for the deficit.
The idea of importation was reconsidered by economists in February this year as a result of the continuous devaluation of the rouble in the early 2000s.
With regard to the difficult relationship with the West, the issue of refusal of imports is now becoming even more urgent.
The Act obliges Rytelers to be counted with domestic producers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to importation, and the production planning system for the required products will be established within a shorter time,” says Oleg Neil.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the breast industry, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover all the chopsticks of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can also receive a powerful impulse.
It is known that the largest share of imports is retained by beef, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65 to 70 per cent are actually Russian products," reasoning Cassianov.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of domestic product quotas will facilitate importation and can accelerate the process.
However, importation would not in itself lead to this initiative, as it required a set of measures, as Litvinenko was sure.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad and thus no full importation will take place, but significant steps will be taken in that regard.
In addition, quotas were not set, domestic products needed to be made available in the country to meet these quotas.
The quotas are the ones that will provide these guarantees,” the expert notes.
Short-term diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Andrzeline Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother's memory, which died of egg cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers have analysed the maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with “the race of eggs” in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent lived five years after the diagnosis had been diagnosed.
The lead researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Research QIMR Berghofer reported that the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas in the state than those living in urban areas.
NEVERAL MEASURES: New drugs can reduce lung cancer and egg cancer
Researchers have traced women ' s health in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the cancer of eggs, current diseases and socio-economic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote parts of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of egg cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological oncology, and mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services in order to reduce the impact of distances, she suggested that an increase in the number of services on departures that would enable professionals to treat women closer to their homes and programmes of support for people living far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, irrespective of geographic location, the study found that life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective strategies for treatment and prevention.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer will be published today in Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Nev, was told that she had an aggressive form of egg cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open the door in the Kuженer area
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibelak began in April this year and was conducted by a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Office of Public Communications and Information of the Head of Mary El, funding for the construction of the site was financed by the Republic budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility built is nearly 230 square metres.
There will be medical assistance for the population of eight settlements: villages of Toktaibelak and villages of Dementievo, Püncherümal, Tuña, Fomici, Toraybelak, Shinoru and Chashkaal.
The new Feldscher-Acouscher post will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and his premises are not in conformity with the hygienic requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in an improper state will be brought before a court
The Chuvashii woman will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksars, the investigation of the criminal case against the 31-year-old resident of Novochebossarsk accused of causing death on grounds of unwaryness has been completed.
The investigation found that the accused and her four-month son had arrived on 26 July to celebrate the birth of their child in Cheboksara.
After a long reservoir, the Newswoman decided to stay in the guests and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up and wept at night, the negligent woman put him next to her bed to feed his breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son, causing him to die.
The criminal case, reported by the SSC press service on Chuwashiya, has been sent to the court.
Inflation's out of leave.
Do Russians Feel Abrupt Price Growth
As a result of cross-sanctions by the RF and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and fail to be predicted by the authorities, the WTB Capital analysts are convinced.
In the view of the experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes the RBC Daily.
According to the latest projection of the Ministry of Economy, in 2014 inflation would be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, and in the next year it would be less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the Commersant’s newspaper, this week the MER should make a “little but principled” macroeconomic projection until 2017.
According to the publication, the department can reduce the estimates of inflation for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected population income growth.
It was projected that the food sanctions of the RF were in force for the year until August 2015.
How could such inflation be assumed in such a situation?
The current situation is one-time shock, but the downward inflation trend will not change," said the Munfin newspaper source.
Economists from the VTB Capital do not share the Government ' s financial and economic demands on inflation and project price increases of 8 per cent in 2014.
Experts are convinced of the main effects of the product bans, together with the possible introduction of a sales tax in the RF regions (GSP) in 2015.
The inflation peak of 9% will have to be on February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, the experts believe.
By the way, last week Rostat subtracted the first inflationary results after the RF introduced “accourageous sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and identified their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of the FC AForex:
Price increases are already taking place in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when the socially important products were valued, the Government had to launch a systemic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and rhetors are already accountable on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities can know exactly who, when and for what reason initiate price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital flows, the excessive refinance of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, the internal conversion due to the foreign exchange flight, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the value of the minimum package would not have jumped by 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food has led to a shock of supply in the domestic market and has led to a perfectly logical increase in final value.
Since we are not able to fully implement the importation mechanism at this stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to risk inflationary growth.
If there are also fiscal reasons for lack of confidence in national currencies, as well as deteriorating prospects for economic growth, inflation can be more than 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Roswaev, director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached between 20 and 30 per cent per month and was also higher than the current level, another case, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the end of the year is going to be 8 to 8.5 per cent.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of the UK Foundation of Maguta
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successful, but if there is a further increase in pressure, especially on the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population that are traditionally shown in cash purchases to safeguard their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the CBC and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth reduction of the rouble, both by market and by public regulation.
But price increases are traditionally beginning after a year's shadow, and perhaps this autumn will become more tangible.
The consumption inflation target in Russia is likely to be 7.5 per cent, as the FM still has financial accumulations.
Agricultural centres are applauded by the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, due to an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, could lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “priority age of gardening”, according to the study HTA reported in Financial Times.
According to this report, housing renters spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that household owners spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of parking yards and the reduction of garden size as other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated at $5 billion per year.
In the Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest in Britain is the cost of household gardeners.
HTA and Royal Gardening Society reported that rental of housing and the absence of garden space did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden adviser in RHS, said: “Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with themselves when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the golden age of retail trade for gardening as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will be improved this year by a better weather after the adverse conditions of March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted mass cleansing at the Landeder Foundation

Turkey calls for a United States diplomat in connection with the report on the spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British spy in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister of Bulent reported that the American case-believed and Turkish officials discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine "Der Spiegel" and the Internet Journal "The Intercept" reported that the documents provided by the former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowen showed that Turkey was a priority exploration site for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Rejep Tayip Erdogan of Turkey has diminished the importance of the communication by saying that all leading countries are spies.
Previously reported that the German main intelligence agency had also made Ankaru the object of exploration, a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
Largest Chinese companies joined against Alibaba
China ' s companies, among them the largest commercial property devil in China, Dalian Wanda Group and the Tencent Holdings Internet Guigants (Soccents, Messenger et al.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engineer), create a company that will compete on the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet that left behind even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will be difficult.
Union of the Greatest
The company is planning to invest 5 billion Yuan (814 million), 70 per cent Wanda and 15 per cent of each Internet company, as reported in Wanda Group.
The firm is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine the Baidu search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social society in China, whose number is about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial property sites throughout China and 40 commercial centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and a thematic park of entertainment in Cindao, East China, on the shore of the Yellow Sea.
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors each year and yield $960 million in profits.
Wanda also owns the American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to provide all its trade centres, hotels and places of entertainment with e-commerce services, the development of which will take place as an Alibaba competition.
According to Dune Tze, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by the next year.
The new site should be the largest online to-offline platform in the world, notes Dan Tze.
The point of the online to-offline (O2O) of commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet to come to normal offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is the sale of coupons such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," said Wanda Van Jianlein, leader of Bloomberg.
“Now there is no O2O site in China, and in this situation the chances of everyone are approximately equal,” he considers.
The Chinese Internet trade market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co estimates that it will increase more than three times by 2015 than in 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, and Bloomberg provides official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And it is projected that by 2015, that number could rise to 850 million.
The Richest Union
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten had before recently been the richest person of China, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, founder Alibaba Jack Ma had already attacked him by $5.5 billion.
The state of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is accounted for in Alibaba.
Baidu Robin Li's leader is now the third one among the richest people in China, while Van Jianlein of Wanda is the fourth rating line.
"In this battle, it's very interesting to see that three of the richest people are united in their efforts to challenge even more rich," said Bloomberg, the director of the Chinese E-Commerce Research Centre in Hanzhou Zao Lay.
But he believes that the new company will not be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after the creation, "Rim cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba doesn't just compete not only with new companies, but also with well-deserved world Internet trade leaders is evidenced by the previous financial report of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as a medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors together.
The net profits of Alibaba for the period are almost twice as high as the same amount of competitors - it has grown almost three times annually and amounted to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has an enormous potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile applications”, commented on the Bloomberg report by an analyst at the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba site of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile service users of the company in July was 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter had to be on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to identify the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company could be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Alibaba debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may be held on 16 September.
The roadshow companies that are preceding this event will start on September 3.
Alibaba's exit to the IPO is expected to be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the record of US exchanges was the Visa payroll system, which in 2008 made its shares first available, earning $17.9 billion on this account.
At least half of the foodstuffs in trade networks should be Russian production, considered by the Deputies of the Lord.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
It is about amending article 8 of the FZ “On the basis of public trade regulation in the FM” and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures for Russian food producers.
An important clarification under the Bill is that at least 50 per cent of domestic production products in shops should be for each product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will have a “food” to avoid a possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the RF, which sets a 10 per cent low rate of VAT for all food products whose country of origin is Russia, reports the newspaper “Investigation”.
On 27 August, a draft law amending the Retail Markets Act was introduced to the lower House of Parliament, which proposes to reintroduce in Russia farm markets where small producers can implement their products.
The Chief of Police of Magalut is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by police officers and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the State prosecutor of Malorki on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Kuorth Island of Malorka was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in a scandalously known centre of undisturbed drunkenness of Magaluf.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of the charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street on which the majority of the bars and nightclubs of Magaloff are located.
According to the daily Mallorca Diario online publication, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by the police and municipal officials of Calvia into the office of the Malorki Procurator for Combating Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guards of the Spanish National Guard for charges of corruption and would be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the dissatisfaction of nightclub owners said protectionism by the authorities was seriously affecting their business status.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
We cannot endanger our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magalut was placed in the titles of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube showing an 18-year-old British rester who was mined to 24 men during the raid on bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the bullying in an improper state among the resting Magaluth, minimizing the number of scandalized alcohol leaks on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Carnage bar sponsors were combined with €55000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular among young British resters, was also a place of many accidents in alcohol-related cases related to the crazy fun known as “Balkoning” when people jump from one balcony to another or from balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
SESNA prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing rainfall and strong winds that affected airports to Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., followed 6.6 mm during the Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a burst wind, including a thunderstorm that started shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave the early spring part last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to the maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The feasible conditions are expected to serve as one of the reasons for the delay in landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land right after 7:30 p.m. but got into the wind shift zone -- a sudden change in speed or direction of wind at a short distance -- and had to take a height.
Wind breaks reached 50 km/h in the Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight showed that the aircraft had to climb altitude during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed about 8:40 a.m.
The delay in this flight delayed several other flights, including Emirates' flight from Dubai and Qantas from Sydney.
Maximum 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with one or two rains.
Calculation of construction facilities in the FM will be done in a new manner
Pricing, construction management and connectivity issues are monitored by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The FAS has established an expert council on the development of competition in the construction field.
At its meeting, the Head of the FAC Control, Construction and Natural Resources Management of the FAS Vadim Slovev stated that “the current calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is totally incomprehensible”.
The normative framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable price of construction, is considered in the FAS.
The cost of building public facilities at the design stage is proposed to determine, based on market prices, constructive solutions instead of the current estimated standards and the single cost of technology operations.
These proposals have been incorporated into the “road map” and are under consideration in the minestro.
“The replacement of traditional projected documentation in construction for the calculation of the design elements shall result in less corruption in the industry,” explained Wadim Slovov.
Because it's now counting every bolt and gay, and it's not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, non-voluntary construction companies can bury whole tractors.
In the minestro with the FAS, we agree.
“The first invention on cost-setting for constructive elements is already in place: the methods for calculating the prices of constructive solutions, the estimates for these indicators have been developed,” explained the WGB Chief of the Urban Department and the architecture of the minestre of Helena Jukova.
The pilot area of road construction is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the WGB told the head of the Profi Invest of Anatoly Demiyanko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
“As regards proposed design calculations, it is difficult in practice to do so, as buildings are often used with very different technologies,” he believes.
It's no secret that the building develops in a large way because of the State order.
According to the President of the NP, the “Expert Community of Professionals of State Order” of Catherine Lezina, today the State is the most able to pay.
The Manufacturer for Engineering of the Industrial Capital Centre of Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov pointed out that the market today is in a conditional division to companies with access to the portfolio of contracts and to companies that own monopolies and do not allow competitors to do so.
He believed that the creation of a transparent market was possible only if access to contracts was to be guaranteed to the maximum extent possible by someone's control.
The Expert Board was invited to establish a State order system in such a way that the same executing member was not entitled to obtain more than one RU 1 billion or more contracts with a value of more than 1 billion roubles.
The Minstros believe that this approach needs to be evaluated in terms of the impact on business as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As explained by Elena Jukova, it would be necessary to provide the contractor with the functions of the gene contractor, which would lead to an increase in the staffing of the contractor and the budget costs for the contractor's maintenance.
In doing so, customers will have knowledge to assess the quality of and security of the work done by contracting organizations.
In many cases, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of high-quality public procurement participants owing to the lack of interest in obtaining a State order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
Alexander Eustaschenkov, the expert consulting centre of the Procurement Institute, believes that the State procedure has now become a business game for the contractor's attention.
The example was: "a participant in filling the application must specify "concrete indicators" without the words "or equivalence", "out", "more", "more", "anlogy", "analog", "or", "type", "not below", "not lower", "higher", "might", "may" "may have", "may be" "not before", "not before", "not above", "not allowed" etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application by contracting organizations.
Another 44-FZ problem, according to Eustaschenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the participant ' s paper proposal during the application stage.
In considering the application of the participant, only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
It was also suggested that the expert board should transfer the marginal income from the upper to the lower level so that intermediate contractors could disappear.
The President of the Expert Council, the status secretary, the FAS leader, Andrey Krarikovsky, believes that this is not worth it because the gene contractor has to be responsible for the commission.
And otherwise, as in the famous arcade reprize of Arkina "Atelle," "Is there a claim to the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories close to the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after they had spent the summer in shelters when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed when the Territory recovered after hostilities.
The beginning of school sessions brought joy and excitement to the settlements affected by the missiles of southern Israel, but the patterns of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashosh child garden staff who had hit the rocket removed the marks of shells from the walls and children's mountains before the pupils arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're happy to see the future," said Ronith Bart, a Kibuzz Saad resident and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a sizeable life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shaney Bart, said that suddenly she started going back to school "a little weird."
"It was a hard time and we didn't get out of our homes at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibuzz, located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not walk outside or left their homes, driving to safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape the missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border, where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families still had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city at the border from Gaza, which had been a major force for the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to learn carefully and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas requirement for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
The new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and argues that at least half of the people killed were militants; however, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai employee.
During the hostilities of Hamas and other Gazan militia, 4,551 missiles and mines were fired in Israeli cities, mainly in the southern part of the country.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in the Gaza Strip were damaged and destroyed, and it is estimated that 250,000 persons have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amar, a 13-year-old boy who is now living in a Gaza school.
According to the popular real estate price criterion, the largest winter growth in seven years has been shown.
The housing cost RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic index for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RI data on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed to the country.
The Director of RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-level market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney the housing prices have increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne, by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged from 5 to 6 per cent.
The other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost reductions were received, with prices rising only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loules said that when the spring began, there would be an increase in the number of real estate items placed on sale over a few months later, which would be a "real test" for the market.
“Bearing in mind the current high auction rate of sales, the overall high speed of sales and the current conditions at low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will increase in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Ufa
In the former house of Evdokima and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the Oct. Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The 16th - century house has remained virtually unchanged since the construction season, except as old as it is.
Foreign people go to the tour, and residents are more suffering than happy, their privilege to live in the oldest Uphim home, whose walls are remembered by the general of Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction is not accurate, historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open doors, squeaking stairs.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls crack, and the streets are seen in the lights of the plastic plastic.
I think everything's holding up honestly.
And the local people say, "You don't think it is."
Living in the 18th - century wooden house is very difficult, ” says Tatiana Lukianova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the public guard, but it's not spent tens of years on it, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities have just forgotten about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still artificially holding, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet and sing every week in the public bathroom.
How can we be content in such a situation?
The road goes right under the windows, even the pedestrian zone is gone.
Tatian's putting off the curtain.
It is now clear that it has only been heard — a traffic flow under windows.
You see, the glass is always wooden, the windows cannot be opened, and the noise is used.
But man is accustomed to what is good and bad.
Our apartment is even more exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
Still, we have two rooms, three with our son.
And other families have a much worse environment, on the second floor, the ceiling is a little over one and a half meters high.
To contrast, Tatiana proposes to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 of Ludmila Oldestina.
A pleasant hospitality woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a room room, 14.5 m2 per four, and we live with my husband and daughter with the granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another place, and Ludmila's eyes are surrounded by a room: antresoli, two couchs with a letter "g", and one of them has a laptop granddaughter.
Very closely and very little different from the normal domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But it regularly flows from the ceiling: the water pipeline does not go anywhere.
Sophia speaks of her apartment in common and intriguingly at the same time as an Italian woman whose house is on Roman ruins.
So it's going to be one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was spent some 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we had a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from the former chat room.
We live just where Demids and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, is it why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Centre, privatization doesn't matter.
Still, we'll get just one room apartment, we can't claim for more.
Four months ago, we were promised to be settled, but the promises did not go on.
I'm not used to complaining or I'm not.
This apartment (room!) has lived a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, me and my husband and my granddaughter with the granddaughter.
Anything has happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the fligel walls, they're a foot thickness!
They say the solution was confused on the eggs, so it's been a long time.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
I guess that's why no one's been killed by the ceiling or his own.
Only the construction still dies slowly in our eyes: the boards and the logs of the house rotate, the floors fall through repeatedly, we poured cement, but all the useless solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it's under our secret loaf room and walking to the Bela River, which was specifically done by some old-fashioned old-timeers here, so that we could get away from the danger, in case.
They were persecuted.
Sophia Oldestine tells us how some historian came to them, begging him to let him start the excavation in the apartment.
And then I persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for one of them on the October projection.
Sophia denied the historian:
Where are we four to one?
There's a small hope here that will make housing more spacious.
We're not going to win anything, will we?
In fact, the Ancient's family won nothing.
Soomila's greatest dream was to be settled and her 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
So two families have a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
A sympathetic, miniature girl, Olesi Karsakova, from apartment Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two close rooms, a total of 23 m2, called apartments, a large family live there.
We're seven people, two children.
You see what the conditions are.
Slices like window frames, walls in the kitchen and rooms are broken by sparkling holes.
It's only cold in the tap year.
As we walk through the oldest house of Ufa, we can be sure that Lavrentiev’s spouses were most fortunate from Housing No. 4.
They're holding the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
75 squares, three persons.
We live just in those rooms where Suvorov, by legend, stopped while he was in Uf, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitrievie Lavrentev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
It's one bad thing, all around the shirt, falls, moves.
The neighbors must have told!
The most torment we have with the floors: the wooden boards were rotten, the ground was literally out of the foot.
I've put in a clay, nothing in the hall, and in the other room we're walking like we're rolling on the ducks, so much awkward.
Alexander Dmitrijević can best tell the guide about the house of the merchant Eudokim Demidov.
The gold industry is regarded as a family, speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the owner of the Kaginski factories and Uzian plants built houses, poured out guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The merchants are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I lived here as a child in the '40s of the 20th century, says Alexander Dmitrievich.
At that time, wooden rooms for carets, benches, and caravan benches were surrounded, which were then demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something prevented...
History was repeated in 2014, once again using new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, waived the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments was moving to 2015 or 2016.
Something we don't believe in all of this...
Two years ago, Laurentev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
The residents did not accept.
They sent a paper from one table to another, and then, like a ridicule, they issued a paper without a signature and a press, "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the inhabitants."
I have even felt that our home has been out of town for a long time, since first it was number 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like he's been demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet addressed the lead sector of land management information and analysis, Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
An October Revolutionary House 57/1 is included in an old housing resettlement programme.
I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only I know that there was a plan at the time to demolish all old houses, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, has been successfully implemented.
The inhabitants are soon to be settled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, Italian specialists who participated in the rebuilding of the buildings in Venice will be able to rebuild the House of Demidov.
An architectural biennale is now under way in Italy, and the Old Uf project is presented there among the others.
I hope that by the year 2016, all the old Kazana Street will be reinstated, says the official.
Houses will be acquired with an appropriate view that was the same as before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all.
In addition, the Government has decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
It's not going to happen, unfortunately, too much intrusive roads in town.
Russell people from the future museum, Vladimir Barabash, promises in 2015.
On the other hand, they are unlikely to be satisfied that their new apartments will be the same as the current.
Only from another age.
There's a forest fire in the Premiere because of the storm.
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the area of Forestry in the Pozar district of Primara.
There is an increase in the grouping of forces and funds at the fireplace.
According to the “Primar Airbase” management, the conditions created in the fireplace require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Airbase:
The fire that appeared in an unaccompanied area found an observer pilot on board an Ang-2 patrol aircraft at an area of 3 hectares.
The wood remnants on the old burner are burned.
The high denseness of the Territory and the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of fire-fighting deposition sites poses considerable difficulties in carving.
We need a MI-8.
The delivery of the force of the Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft at the disposal of the aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, 4 firefighters were quickly planted.
The main task of the professionals is firefighting and the preparation of the site for the delivery of additional firefighting forces and equipment.
In the area of lunch, three fire fire wards were delivered to the village area by helicopter.
Once the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, specialists will be thrown to the site of the site, reported on the website of the administration of the Primor province.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugs me.
Never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born from Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearss a comedy, Rudy's Red plates, which is partly based on the imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from the radio 4 series.
Soundtrek is a mixture of reggie and rap, and the melodies are lively.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, he had a “many ” treatment, and Henry was often thinking about his father's relationship.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, but you've heard his voice.
Stay away from my sister.
Move!
I want to watch a cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, went to his pub and talked about things like a beer glass, the beauty of a screaming blow.
I never talked to him that way.
He was such an uncomfortable guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a Lieutenant workshop in Dadley, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been like.
Now it's a little better, but it's dark, smoked, labyrinth labyrinths with flames and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father got into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself, because he wanted to wash himself off the lithe workshop.
When I came there, I realized that he was doing this for years and years to earn our food, and I appreciated it more.
Nevertheless, Henry left his child with no parental love.
My father never hugs, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he lacked in childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I make friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Frank, where he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I have a friend with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very well adjusted and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious exercise of phytens, and I also had to sit on a rigorous diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career trajectory is probably reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he got criticized for his Othello, he's been completely in the theater.
She followed the "Little Comic" and then Ogasta Wilson Fights.
This work is different from the slices and comedies, which were an integral attribute of its saturated professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 years old and worked in a factory.
Digey noticed how he roamed on the stage and wrote about it in "New faces."
His TV career began in the mid-seventh: "I've been the only black parodist/commicio on TV for a long time."
He went to work.
Not only did I have to grow in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective tapping machine for jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in “New Persons” in 1975
Since his manager had the right to "Black and White minstrells," a light entertainment program where people have "injected their face," Henry found out he's been in it for five years.
My family didn't like that much.
I kind of want this to never happen to me, but I'm not sorry I did it.
Although it was a weird, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the prize of the easy entertainment classic in British television for years and years" was also a grotesque parody for black people.
In introducing the characters who mocked and sang the black culture in Britain, Henry worked in an alternative comic project in the eighty.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineteenth season it was known as, among other things, Chief Gareth Blacklock of the "Shef!" comedy series.
Advertising videos, documentary movies, television series and movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, Lenny Henry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling out time or shrinking away?"
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy on Shakespeare.
You can't say that I was being taught this in school, and I thought it was a lot of the prerogative of middle-class whites with colgots and hoodlums downstairs.
So I was really afraid of him.
Everybody we interviewed for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't bother it until you know what you're talking about.
Speak out some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Othello monology for documentary transmission, and he was trapped.
I have a feeling I can do that.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"That's what it is, this is a serious matter, take it seriously, teach your text, conduct a little study.
So the rehearsal process was rigid, and I read this play months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a disaster, and she didn't happen.
Soon we started the "Load Commemoration."
Suddenly, I was in the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical breakdown, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"The silent voice inside of me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they do the computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the submission would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene and said something in me, "Oh, thank God."
That's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else figure this out.
"You play in a play, stay in the role."
Henry's in the Grounds at Dachess theatre.
It was difficult to study the text for the Camps.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the musculature.
She was also well accepted, so it was like a sign from above showing, "That's what you need to do."
He says that, of course, in a loud voice.
So I'm holding this.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry's still having a comic thinking -- all the way our conversation is interrupting the outbreaks of his humor when he starts, he ends paroding.
I just decided not to work in the standup because this thing with instant remuneration from the full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you're always trying to do that, it can lead to a stalemate.
I sometimes work at the Apollo Prama, when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much fun as I used to.
I'm wondering if he'll give you a tour of the bandade ever.
It's a pleasure to sit in a room with a director who's helping to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give up on it.
So that's his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya began the biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payment statement.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after the resignation of the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in government structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (700000) per month was missing from “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that wages continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, report BBC Vanjama Chebusiri, from the capital, Nairobi.
All public officials should appear within the next two weeks at the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, is reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without consideration will be excluded from the payment statement, is reported therein.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the streamlining of the public service by determining the actual number of government officials, and will also be used to clear the payroll statement at both levels of the Government, thus putting an end to the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Wyguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structure of Government.
Tens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with a “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reported by local information agencies.
The police did not comment immediately.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daley News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the telephone.
President Rejep Taip Erdogan of Turkey (who was then Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic Cleric of Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine opened their doors again on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been a major event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniya Yacenuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told the expected journalists that not all schools had been reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
All Ukraine, the huge single Ukrainian people's front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexan Pastukhov, the school director in Slaviansk, whose daughter Jaceniuk went to talk Russianly.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will benefit them in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, she may have found such a powerful leader as she needs.
It is followed by a fame grain from the banking, media and the interior of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leading positions.
Her career began at the Bain and Co Global Administration Consulting Company and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearson media world.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a high post in the head company of Pearson's took up a lower-level colleague.
It is said that her earnings are approaching $1 million.
Its political rating is also valid.
She was recommended by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring professionals from the private sector to Whitehol: she became a adviser to the Cabinet of Ministers.
Her husband's former counselor Tori.
Previously in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned cup.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the very heart of public life, but its structure has an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: inside both the top level of the management hierarchy of BBC itself, but outwardly the voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
It is an almost incomprehensible duel, which requires complete radical reform.
But what a new chairman would risk coming, stirring up and destroying the institution as difficult as the Chinese dynasty if he had lost his own job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be pleased to see BBC decline in size, after revising its authority, finance and status.
As competitors narrow down the circle and new technologies challenge the comfortable old habits, the inevitable cost-of-licensing negotiations pose a special threat to BBC.
For a modest amount of $145.50 a year, British are likely to become the largest media enterprise in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it states that its work covers 96 per cent of households and stands for each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, the popularity of Beeb is obviously increasing: 53 per cent support it today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
The BBC view and use models have changed: I now get news headers on the mobile phone and I'm looking for the missing iPlayer programs.
But it remains a very popular and inspiring institution.
He needs an inspiring chairman -- I hope he found him.
Perry of Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
Tweet from the confirmed Texas Governor ' s record, Rick Perry, on Sunday night contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the democrats, who was at the centre of the prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later removed and followed by another account of Perry, where the record was undone.
I just published a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I took it away," reports a later record.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the communications requesting a comment.
Although the records were downloaded from the confirmed Perry account, it was not clear who actually was engaged in publishing on the tape.
An earlier tweet contained an undue cartoon at the Travis Rosmarie Lemberg District Procurator, who was found guilty of driving in a state of drunkenness in April 2013.
Perri banned the financing of her department when she resigned, which led to a large jury in Austina this month against Perry, a potential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The signature in the Tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a condition of drunkenness, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood... but when I do that, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg statement did not investigate with the participation of a large jury against Perry.
They were trained by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republical judge.
Perry did not admit his guilt and called the charges a political stigma.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge leading the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor, who had performed his duties longer than everyone in the history of Texas, was vague, which was contrary to the Constitution.
Perri has stopped the funding of $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, based in the Travis County, to pursue corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg resigned.
The veto made a formal complaint by the left-handed public control team.
The post of the confirmed account Perry is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party's convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, he responded to rumours that he could come out of the game by posting a tweet of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "the normal state"
One of the most famous London builders warned that the real estate market in south-eastern England “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of revitalized demand and rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pigley, founder and chairman of Berkeley's elite construction company, said on Monday, “From the beginning of this financial year the market has returned to the normal level of transactions from the peak of 2013”, adding that it has provided a “steady working environment”.
The London real estate market was successful during the downturn, as foreign buyers had moved to the capital.
City prices have risen by 18.5 per cent in the last year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly overtaking the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the Pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around the potential “non-person” for general elections in the next May.
Foxtons, London Real Estate Agency last week, warned that the April reform of the mortgage market, which introduced more stringent terms of loan, would also reduce market growth both by real estate sales transactions and by prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from Bank of England showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages in June, presuming further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its projection for the increase in London real estate prices for 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions dropped by a quarter compared with the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley by raising sales amounts above $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijley added, "The demand for the right goods with good design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting it, the sales have been retained for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost one third more than the 2007 docrisis peak.
Annual revenues to taxes rose by 40 per cent, compared with the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to $1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual assembly of the company, Mr. Pigley reported that the expected Berkeley revenues for this year would meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profits are expected over a year before taxes are paid in £450 million.
Berkeley's shares were held on £23.96 in the afternoon of the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual prize of the American cinema.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Prize, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a "directory" of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Hungry Games Star confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real and condemned the hacker for “the gulf of intrusion into personal space”.
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted and will be persecuted by anyone who publishs the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photos originally posted on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly received due to the lack of online storage system Apple iCloud, and the alleged “directory” of victims of hacking includes the names of dozens of women names, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photographs are true, although the Star Scott Pilgrim versus all, Winsted in Twitter also condemned theft.
"He who's looking at the pictures that we've done with my husband a few years ago by being alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winsted in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victoria-Conquererer" refuted that she, in her photographs, wrote in Twitter, "These so-called photos of the naked FALSHIBKI, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a representative of the pop star of Ariana Grande refuted that the photos where she was supposed to be true.
Exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and the letter "J" that praised critics.
They were dissolved, the best thing to say is that they gradually collapsed like a cardboard box left under the rain.
Only at times did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy in association, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw a bitterness in himself.
He was a thorn like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this thorn was a little novel from which he waited for more than usual to get rid of lonely and boring life and perhaps even some kind of satisfaction.
Aileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beautiful woman with blasphemous hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and severe than Port Royben.
She came to the south with her oldest friend Kevern thought she was an aunt, and she inherited a home in a raw but beautiful valley called the Rain Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The hubs flowed, sitting spiders in the baths motionless, and the slippers left their marks on all the windows assured that the house belonged to them; the garden sprouted with weeds similar to the giant cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a child book, while frightening and fascinating, with full secrets of a garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel is included in the Bucker Prize in 2014.
Short letter will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eylinn were sitting behind their hands in broken sheds among the high grass, enjoying a sudden warm spring day; both of them were dispersed to the cheap convoy that provided the country with a dying music and soothing news when, looking at its chilly brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long-forgotten black performer whom his father loved to listen to his father's curtains in the house.
You have too big feet.
Because of their aggressiveness, they didn't play that kind of console song anymore.
They were not forbidden - nothing was forbidden - just didn't lose them anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "arhaic."
The public taste was doing things that could never have been achieved by orders and regulations, and just as among books people chose rich memoirs, growing in poverty, culinary books, and love novels, they chose ballads from all the music.
Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing Aileen’s large legs.
Aileen didn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fats Waller," he said to her by caring for two fingers.
That's what his father always did to stop "J" before she flies off his lips.
It started with the game they played when they were little.
His father played it with his father as he told him.
Start the word "J," forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was waiting for it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Aileen's never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, although he wasn't banned.
The Improvement has gone out of fashion.
There's only one place left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same with fuss.
His unpredictability was on the nerve.
And jazz was an appetite expressed by music.
Although he was 10 years old and had never heard of Sammy Davis Mladsham, Kevern knew of a jazz from a father's semi-secret cocktail.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she was unlikely to remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressures.
The community was obedient, and that meant that each segment agreed with gratitude -- thanks to those who had been preserved -- with the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin, according to thermal and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The exiters from Instant, as if naturally talented in everything about electronics, took up the need for no family to stay without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was sanctioned; what was left of the Greek was the beating of the plates.
Gulf originates and Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country when TWO, WHAT WAS FROM, had occurred, feared that they were accused of incitement to flames, in fear that flames would swallow them, opened restaurants with the lab and the calianes, were not pushed out and pushed away from the idle.
Everybody by ability.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Aileen was hard to understand how insulting words that Kevern just said to her could have been placed on music at all.
Music is a expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Unless, maybe, for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he admired this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could pass through the sound insulation of giant leaves similar to cabbages.
Aileen still didn't understand.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to pinch the lips again.
She thought he was weird already.
"Him it seemed funny," he said instead.
She blew her head incredibly, shutting down Kevernae's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except a dump of her blackish hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, staying in her opinion.
But it doesn't explain why you're eating it to me anyway.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles may be a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just a stupid song.
He could've said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you've got fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such an aversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be ridiculous.
Attempts to make jokes often made him embarrassed, for like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the atrocities that had blew in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to.
Notwithstanding good eyes.
Aileen Solomons painted and stood up from herslon, twisting the console and the shelves of the wine they drank.
The wine of the basin, so the drunkenness could not justify it.
In her excitement, she seemed to trembling like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"And I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
Though you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she had given him a resentment.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in a cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main traits she looked like an outside archipelago.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and disgusting after TWO, THAT THAT TRUST, WHICH THERE'S ALL OVER than their ancestors, smugglers and destructors, roared in rage from the pub to the pubs ready to raise their hand on any woman who dared to refuse or jeopardize them.
A stupid head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
First of all, kissing is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote from the fresh balloons that the console gave is to kiss her first and then hit her.
Kevern’s view was too clear because the kiss was a bully in itself.
Aileen Solomons showed him that he had to leave.
He got out of the chase like an old man.
She felt lead weight herself, but his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and out of the top window, she watched him leave, her friend was a man who had himself been struggling.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought she.
She felt inclined to be compassionate to him and men at all, even though some of them had raised their hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a screwed back, strangled, beaten, all the ability to fight left him -- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember a single case until she saw it?
Again, Aileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or around the events described above, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in the Ophnau, informal public mood, prepared a small report on the persistence of the low and medium level of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease if it did not stop altogether, given the means and forces allocated to its eradication.
“Many things have been done, and much is done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these intertwined branches and narrow veins of the area, where, despite the fading of the fences of the churches, the gentle breath of human kindness was rarely felt throughout history.
However, some qualities are not eliminated.
The higher the spilt seems to be the lower the passions that it produces.
The population shed tears over the sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcome obstacles and declares its fervent faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness maintains its strong strife both in rural and urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and malignant storing in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have a worn-up habit of writing too much," said her academic leader, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less novels.
Esse Nussbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," said Esse Nusbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinoviz, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypervisibility, absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy in themselves, may sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you are biased against the church, or what you call "wicked" and "grim", others would interpret as a expression of natural love and energeticity.
Continue to miss TOM, which has been done, unless it has been done, as if it had occurred, if at all, yesterday, it would deprive the country of the necessary life.
Esse Nusbaum looked around while Rabinovits spoke.
On his head, pink, like flamingo, light diamond letters repeated the advice Ophnau gave the country the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile your neighbor, price your spouse, listen to the ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, accept, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, a word of song is better than written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," answered Esse Nusbaum quietly when she found out that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't cured ourselves as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to that, which has been accomplished, unless it has been done.
Only this time will we throw away our anger and mistrust against others.
Luther Rabinovits put the ends of his fingers together in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "by calling "fronts" of actions that our grandparents did or did not.
You go too far, and when you say they've thrown their "growls" and "distrust" on "others."
In your place, no man should need to remind us that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "no."
There was no "us" and there was no "others."
It was a riot time, that's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," dared to insert Esma, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what was done is done.
It was then.
You don't have to say anything, we're here to agree.
And how no one should be blamed, there's no need to be justified if it's appropriate or if there's something that could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn?
It's a past thing to let us forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther's pyramid rabbinowick's collapsed.
"I'll consider your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was beaten by a motorcycleist who went out on the sidewalk, as the passersby described, "in an awful rage."
Coincidence occurs.
Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho's army challenged the coup d ' état to overthrow the Government, stating that they had acted against the police suspected of attempting to armed political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
Premier took his family to neighbouring South Africa, stating that he had been threatened by an attempt on his life.
The representative of the Army, Major Ntlelele Ntoi, said that there was actually no coup, but that the army had reacted to a threat from the “political fanatics” that the police had tried to arm.
“What happened this morning is that Lesotho's command of the Armed Forces has taken action, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties that were ready to build chaos,” he informed the American Voice.
The representative of the Government of South Africa, Clayson Moniela, said that the actions of the army looked like a coup.
“While no one has filed a claim for the seizure of power by force, it is all known that the activities of the Lesotho Armed Forces have at present the main signs of the coup,” he said.
Lesotho's army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that it was calm in the capital.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Mattsing runs the Government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked as a result of an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in its combined Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government despite charges of retrospect.
Marco van Ginkel will spend the forthcoming season on lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
In the past season, he was only three times on the field of the London Club.
Remember, Milan used to rent from Liverpool the attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest 13 months
The growth in Eurozone has slowed down to the lowest 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Business Activity Index (PMI) of the Eurozone Production Sector on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, declining from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and enterprises were affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The values came to the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets will wait for a clear plan of how to deal with the stopping of the eurozone, as well as with the risk of deflation in inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that head of ECB Mario Dragi later this week may give additional signals that he is considering the quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"While any growth is better than any growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, the economist Markit.
The PMI of the German production sector, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of marking 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the block, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of concern, as is Italy ' s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Mr. Dobson said that the notion that the momentum of growth is deprived of much of the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, too, does not add confidence.
Industry deceleration is likely to continue to overflow oil into the fire to analysts awaiting additional coinary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI had risen to 57.3 and its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing we can say about the August Business Indicator of the Eurozone Productive Sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: “Eurozone producers appear to find life very difficult at this time, as the current growing geopolitical tensions, especially related to Russia/Ukraine, add uncertainties to the complexities of many countries.
This increased tension evidently struck by business - especially on the basis of consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders are delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said, "It's more like," that the ECB will, of course, have to do some quantitative mitigation varieties, "though we suspect it will be limited."
Mariopol’s residents are going to stand up a live chain against the militia
In Marioupola, until the last week, it was all quiet — no one had teared himself down to organize the Marival People’s Republic, the city on the Azov Sea was living and working.
The people are now horrible to expect the "militia" to come.
According to politicians, separatists break through Mariopol to get to the Azov Sea - a city of Novoazovsk recently, which had not been part of self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariusolians decided that the Ukrainian army would, though, protect them, but it had a little force against the well-armed DNR-LNR representatives, and had gathered to help the military.
They roam trenches, build blockposts and reinforcements.
On the evening of Saturday, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city and got into a live chain, splashing the hymn of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in the event of coming.
The volunteers collect and collect equipment and food, collect medicines, publish the newspaper.
In the city shops are gradually closed, banking and banking shut down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the gruesome hijacking of school like the children in her still suffering
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen fighters at Beslan school in southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test that struck the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during the atrocities at school.
Ten years later, after the horrible seizure of a non-lane school, 334 people were killed, including 186 children, who had been heroically affected by the catastrophe to warn of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be a kind of extremely possible evil.
The tragedy has united the east and the west in the abhorrence, which has then strikingly escalated into action and hope for the future in the face of the worst woe.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who lied to death during the atrocities of school.
We have discovered amazing young people who have been confronted by the disaster, even though the memory of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now harasses Ukraine, where children like them die, will now cease.
A girl who's trying to get back to the shooting room in a photography.
She's sealed in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Beljakov, when in one laundry tried to get back to the fired sports hall after the mine exploded.
In disappointment, Aid desperately sought out her mother, Larisa, now 40.
They were feared that both of them had died, but they had actually survived.
"Women told me to run, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My legs were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After surgery, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more operations.
A few slices are left in my knee.
Her goal is now to be a dentist, to help people just as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she said with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
I always go to this sports room once a year to remember everyone who's staying there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, was murdered in there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about my family later.
She says the seizure stays with her, although the memories slightly dizzy every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our hardships, and we are so grateful for the assistance we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet, where I go into the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make it stop.
The boy who ran through the bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians begin school at seven years of age) and survived three days of seizure by hugging their mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was a blast and hold her by the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Fetch."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw on the road a weeping baby, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran through the hail bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in a hospital with wounds on her feet, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and huged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now non-existent News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protection from Barnardo's Prime Tony Blair's Foundation and his wife, Sheri.
"This horror returns to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that he's in my memory shaking.
I remember how soon after that I threw out all my toy weapons.
But now I can play games with gunshot, and that's not my problem.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports room, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the courtyard that never came out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the sports room.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store, where I was allowed to pick everything I wanted, and a ride in a car with the open top.
But now he is afraid of places such as Ukraine, where wars lead to the scourge that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry for all those who are suffering from these horrors," said Damire, who worked in a women's monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday, and hopefully I'll be put in the school academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, aged 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the dreadful silence immediately after the capture, just there were no children who would yell and run around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized when people on the other side of the earth could understand our feelings, they could provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I'd like to call Sherie and just tell her herself that 10 years has passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Dami and me.
I remember when Damire wanted to eat a fight, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waitresses in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think this world hasn't been better than this 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel like, the horror of this.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not cycling on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports room from time to time, and they light candles there.
When he was young, he was suffering from this -- I remember he was lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
Don't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he dumped all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I'll never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around myself when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely confident that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
Thus life continues for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Illin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the seizure has become a determinant of the tragedy in Beslan
Sleep: Survivor Beslen George Illin with his mother Fatima after the seizure in 2004 and on the right of George today
His bloody face was a sign of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, was 54, the principal doctor, who took him to school on the first day of school before he took his older son, Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia has survived.
The closer that date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
No one day we don't remember that tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes these days are all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Fountains: Georgia's photograph (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanted to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of Georgia crying in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like looking at this picture, and she's hidden in the bookstore in our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this picture makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "I'm sure this never happened again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
They're now investigating the Bowing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is coming to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, since it's happening?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
We need to go through tens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years, I had nightmares because of my capture, but now it's getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this sports room before September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to go into the sports room, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladicavcas.
I'm going to learn to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military one, but my health didn't allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the killer's legs
It's unlikely that George Farniev was at the hands of the killer terrorist during the capture, but he was able to survive.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a sports room sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
Indeed, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to study at an intelligence officer at the FSB, but couldn't do it because of the damage caused by his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to handle bad things, I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, next year, I was the first and last time I went into this sports room again.
I've lost my mind.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survival: Georgi Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital opened on the laptop after the seizure.
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or discussing it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm going fine.
But still my health didn't allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical findings, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second attraction was the animals, so I went to a veterinary institution.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all the animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
That's not what children should know, and of course not what they have to survive.
His mother, Marina, aged 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremony to be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He stays with us.
Georgie is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept, when something is so badly unfair, it's happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it from his knee.
He's got a few operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say that he's 50% overcoming this nightmare, but it's impossible to get through it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and this only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and I loved.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could have made for me, but my heart is hurt for those who have been killed.
I know the families where new children were born, but I know the widows who have never been married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what is happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I hardly believe it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did it turn out we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them out, as far as you can.
Alena Tkaev, 10 years old
The baby who was touched by the Skarnaza fighter's safe place
Saved: Alena Tskaevu is carrying Russian Skarnaza (to the left) fighter in a safe place.
She's now ten, and she doesn't remember the monstrous crime.
The world had stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was handed over by a Russian policeman from a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally abandoned her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christine and the brother of Mahara at the school sports hall.
Mahar, who was three years old, was rescued, but Alenin's mother and sister died in a fatal slaughter.
Her father, Russen, has since married again, and they and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter he called Christina in memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alena, who is now ten years old, doesn't remember the seizures, and she's braced into a smart and lively girl, they're talking to her neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Sinji Kagawa, a defensor from Manchester U.N., to the Dortmund Borousia, said he looked forward to his returning to the field in the form of a German club.
He said that this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play "Borussy" again.
I feel very good.
Positive emotion, and I look forward to going to the field again in the form of "Borussy."
Remember, Kagava moved to MU from Borusia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to fit into the English club, having only 38 matches in the English championship in two seasons, killing six balls and giving eight effective gears.
A man is accused of going to a girl on a pedestrian crossing at Faif
A 78-year-old man will be brought before a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Faif.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl on the transition to Pittenwin in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart had led his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and had beaten the girl, resulting in trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt in the Sheriff Court of Dundee.
Sheriff Charles McNeir, a royal lawyer, appointed a date of trial for January.
Obama, Mercel and Ollland will not be dissented in Vladivostok
The duty-free trade magistrate of the Duty Free Airport of Vladivostok put out a plate prohibiting purchases at this store by a number of world political leaders.
Don't turn away from them with spirits, vodka, and horses.
The store administration decided that President Barak Obama of the United States, FRG Chancellor Angela Mercel, President François Olland, Vitaly Clicco, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan, and several other well-known comrades would not be able to quarrel with vodka, horses and spirits in their store.
And she put the appropriate plate on the door.
Obama had previously been banned in an even less affordable placement service, the Dietic Crown MHL, as reported by the commutation site.
Whether the U.S. President had ever had a dream of eating in a dietary dining room in Russia, we don't know, but the authors of the bans seem obviously frightening to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to Agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that the Russian agrarians should learn new technologies in the context of the embargo to ensure the production of raw materials for buyers.
The Board was given during the visit to South-Ptypter Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the Restorators to reorientate to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The master coach of the Russian assembly, Valentine Maslakov, is pleased with the outcome of the decaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparations for competition.
Our athletes have spoken at their own level, bringing "The Sport" to the Maslakova words.
The third place is the confirmation of our fairly high command level.
It's nice that the advantages of the French and even the Americans are minimal over us.
We have to take into account that we have not been preparing for these competitions.
The session has been completed, and we have not been obliging our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have been second in this tournament, but during this season, we have a renewed assembly.
On the contrary, the French exhibited a capable team of 13 European championships.
They did not conceal their intention to win this year, which has been publicly announced many times.
But even such hosts could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But in some species, the results were lower than in the same Brilliant League.
The session's over.
Naturally, the athletes are no longer so important, but more so in command-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And as a result, it came to absurd when 1500 m men were so admired by tactical tricks of running that they showed the result below the average... women's runs.
4 hints on how to improve the quality of submarine photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or films underwater, you have a number of options for the appliance.
The cheapest option is a watertight "mile", e.g. Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an extinct camera, for example GoPro Hero3+Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took these pictures at the family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at the price of about $350.
Regardless of which equipment you use, a number of rules must be respected in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery of the camera and other branches are closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you will take.
Some photos and video cameras have camera modes or type of object that optimize the exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping in the water, see how deep your equipment can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our buyer management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take off a couple of staff because many of them won't.
The "milk" has a CCD that helps you compose images, whereas the ex-camer usually doesn't have them.
Even if you have a CCD, it'll be hard to see underwater, and the componing of the frame will be a random process.
So do some personnel.
Also, if your camera has a serial filming regime that takes off a few staff with a little different exposure installations, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The number of lights is decreasing significantly than you diver below the water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off the basin, river, or ocean.
This will also allow you to transmit more colors in your photographs; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Get closer to the site.
It's a great advice for landing, but it's even more important underwater because of dark light conditions.
Particularly important if you take off on an Ex-Camer: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, broad-carbon license, which means you have to get closer to the site of the film if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Bronze Prizer of the Olympic Games in the Free Battle of the Billal Makhov can go into the Greek-Russian struggle.
This was reported by the chief Dagestan collector for the free fight of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude athletes from the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahov is at the gathering of classic teams, bringing the R-Sports to Sajid Sajidov's words.
Actually, Biljal spoke in both styles.
At the 2005 youth world, he became the winner of the voyage tournament and the third grain in the Greek-Rimian competitions and decided to concentrate on free fight.
It's been a long time when we talked about the new phase of our career that we're going to have our hardship in the Greek-Russian struggle.
I'll say more, Makhov can speak at the Tashkent World Championship if he wins the bait.
But the crucial word is always behind the coach headquarters headed by Gogy Coguashvili.
Andrew Louson was such a man whose personal strength could rouse everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to delivering the sick from both the suffering of the disease and the torment of the treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls that there was a MI-6 officer who had had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Louson realized that while doctors are involved in diagnosis and disease, those who receive treatment are mostly concerned about something quite different -- pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like usual," he wrote last May.
I found it hard to find strength.
Responding to symptoms similar to influenza, he discovered that he was provoking his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left business for a week, Loson found that he was uncommon and unclear about why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked his colleague to make a chest-cell X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was riding on skis in the French Alps.
X-rays come.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the lung, or shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to figure out the exact reason.
Although some smokers have contracted lung cancer, for example, not all people who have lung cancer have smoked.
But the mesothelic is different.
In almost every case, the reason is contact with asbestos, fibre construction material, which was once called a miracle, but now known to be a fatal danger.
For most of us, the mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when he was used, only individuals from specific industries worked closely with him, such as tube-isolers, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But this calmness is mistaken.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the mesothelium epidemic today.
Here more people die from mesothelome than in any other country on the planet.
In the annual death of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die of this disease than as a result of road accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelium since 1980 and projected deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have, ultimately, been prohibited by law in 1999), mesotheliums are usually for decades.
And the attack on mesothelomes is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestus was, and in many cases, remains, placed in houses where we live, offices where we work, schools where we go, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, the level of wealth, the profession or age.
The election bastions, from the fashionable London Univermagans to private schools, did not prove to be a rescue.
The Parliamentary Building is asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lowson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tube liner.
In fact, he had to think where he could contact asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It looks like there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Guya hospital, where I spent six years in the intern," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and trucks used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease.
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Out of the four doctors who have been in the hospital in Guya and who have subsequently developed a mesothelioma in the last five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I have survived”.
How many of us will have this disease?
Andrew Louson was diagnosed as “mesothelioma” when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It's been so unusual for a long time.
Fifty per cent of the mesotheliomy patients die eight months after the diagnosis has been diagnosed.
She's always deadly.
So now we can just repeat Louson's question, "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the British lead expert on mesothelome, Professor Juliano Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain has to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most now do not believe that they will die in this way.

A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesotheliomy attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen was misconsidered.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, heading the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main shop at Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before this happened," she says, "I've never heard of the mesothelome, I barely knew about the asbestos.
I couldn't have thought it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have been named from the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibre structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of those six, three were often used in construction.
Crisotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in the bed panels, incineration plate, thermoisolation of pipes, boiling stitches, even in the braking wells of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crocidit).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are sound, although indirect, grounds for believing that this is the main cause of the solely high number of patients with mesoteltomy [in Britain]”.

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as the typical victim of the mesothelome, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of the sick, which suggests that “an existing percentage of mesothelic, when there is no known impact on work or home, was likely caused by the environmental impact of asbestos”.
Most of that impact, he says, is due to “the usual use and weather impact” on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which dealt with the Westminster Palace, shows how people, even at the heart of the government itself, could have been exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees had been contaminated by an asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be driven as harmless as “violent air flows”.
Members of Parliament were often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in that case it seemed that the opposite was the case.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Services Directive insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “pure health certificate”, it now recognized that work should be done at £1 billion in Parliament ' s reconstruction, improved the electrical and asbestos, and that, after the general elections in 2015, members of Parliament might sit at the QE2 conference centre near the Westminster ' s green benches.
Goddard's report stated that "the situation with asbestos was not governed by various rules."
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement would cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to find out their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbot, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lousson, Abbott, age 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he was in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital, which was successfully filed with asbestos claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places where you worked and the dates.
That he remembers clearly, this is the day in early December 2009 when he was hit by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late tonight.
Suddenly, I began to fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the plumb, the shells around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect a mesothelic.
Eventually, he could not go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X - rays from the chest and put pleural catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it to the analysis.
Still, his condition remained without diagnosis.
His health gradually improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he had exercised sports and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbot's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelome."
Even then, however, Abbot didn't link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition had deteriorated again, and his medical adviser showed his findings to the CT and X-rays to the Team of Specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbot began to feel bad, the camera sensor was placed in a strip between his chest and his soft skin.
I'm a optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year, "I've been told that it's mesothelioma."
Gram Abbott: diagnosed mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbot began meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where rather often there was asbestos thermoisolation on trumpets," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma is now impressing younger people with non-typical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos trumpets in hospitals were in the basement, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the staff members who went through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (as Andrew Louson) or ate in the basement desks (as Graham Abbot often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
A few decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, life was saved for politicians, but a place that threatened life for doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolers put their bunken burners on asbestos.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and mayors because of their amazing isolational and flamestry characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely exposed to asbestos for the first time in the class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren placed their burns on asbestos.
There were websites focusing on the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as a tile or a roof of locusts tended to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison in a huge amount of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Louson in a case against Gay hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden barn in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful to sleep the garden barrels.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is horrible.
"In order to realize this, it takes a lot of time," says Graham Abbot.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and figure out what I was doing.
Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the shift from the doctor's position to the patient.
As an inaccurate number of patients before him, he remembers how he was confused with the amount of information he had to accept.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given for about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
The mesothelome is particularly dangerous, because it's the mechanic of how we support life -- the act of breath -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases are mesotholioms due to contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos are destroyed and fibers are breathed, they can be stuck in the puppet, the lung shell.
The asbestos fibers are annoying the leuvre and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises because of the inhaling fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Trejer, a cardiocratic surgeon who came to Gay hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lousson was suspected that he was exposed to asbestos, now, by irony destiny leading the mesothelome treatment centre.
Trejer knew Louson and treated some of the others who were likely affected by internship at the hospital.
When asbestos fall into the fabric of the lungs, says Trejier, "the breath pushes them out on the peripheries where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the outset.
The normal treatment of other forms of cancer is much less effective with mesotheliomy.
The efficiency of surgical intervention, for example, is a hot dispute.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Trejier doesn't agree.
"Can't cut the play," he says.
You can't go around with the knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is "not very good in chemotherapy" which "acts" but doesn't heal.
"Sometimes the sick live long," says Trejier.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than they expect.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbot continues to fight.
After he had been ill by a mesothelioma, Abbotta was introduced to Andrew Lousson, who, four years after diagnosis had been diagnosed, became a united support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Rakova Central," he said vividly when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbot.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbottu offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Louson, nonetheless, "smoothed to give everyone a little more positive color."
When Abbot met several professionals, he decided to continue the treatment with Professor Loik Lang Landawski, a professor of the Torracal Surgery at the Guya Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelics in order to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern about the future of families that they will leave.
They then apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lousson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could be at risk.
It was then that they spoke of the lack of integrity of companies.
Andrew Lousson and Guy hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a full-cost settlement, according to Morgan, because Loison couldn't clearly prove his mesothelioma was the result of contact with the Asbestos at Gay Hospital.
Following his investigation of his death, the representative of the Hospital of Gay confirmed, however, that “the situation in the basement facilities referred to was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Louson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, it was a major problem for the patients with the asbestos who needed compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed their owner or closed their business.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that there is no time on their side that the plaintiffs have.
In response this year, serious new legislation has been enacted, which facilitates the recovery of compensation to the patients with mesothelia, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
According to the Act, a fund of $350 million funded by the insurance industry was established for those who had been diagnosed since July 2012 and who could prove contact, but who could not be judged.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about $120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people who work with mesotheloid patients, believes that $350 million are "very good work" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, implying that the amount is one quarter of what the insurers would have to pay if they had not intervened in the interim period and the patients with the mesothelic were able to track the companies and file the lawsuit in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "unful"
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People suffer so severely and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Bill on mesothelium last December.
By then Graham Abbot was in the hands of Professor Loica Lang-Lasdungski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang Lazoundski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
This was followed by radio therapy and chemotherapy, a three-therapy in which Langes Laszungski can be praised by 40 per cent of those who survived in five years.
Abbot's feeling the tide of strength.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbot.
You see it with the patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbot fled for the operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans did not reveal the traces of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots in my chest.
I was just supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbot went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of tumor.
However, it is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finances, when I die, for example, or what I have to show my wife, how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you're disappointed.
We have to look forward.
As Elly's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It was hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told the girls that I had a disease that means that I would not live until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very friendly and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more self-contained.
She didn't say a lot.
Such conversations are something that you have to face with all the cancers.
But for those with mesothelics, such discussions are not balanced by the hope, even by the glimpse of the opportunity to survive.
This disease has been carried with it (also as it is ultimately for Stephen Jean Gould) a gloomy certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, "the mesothelioma is no threat to life.
The bodies of the pharaohs that are balanced are wrapped in asbestos.
The asbestos vodka is used to strengthen the vodka and increase the warmth.
The asbestos are described by the Asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented, which is not ignited.
I've seen the salfets made of him foaming in the stones on the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to manufacture paper (also a notenote) and tissues.
Large asbestos are opened in Canada and South Africa shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It's an ideal thermalizer for steam engines and the Industrial Revolution turbin.
The world production of asbestos increases to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prrudential statistics identify premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are thus denied life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook shows that the particles of asbestos in her lungs were undoubtedly the main cause of death.
It's the first case of that kind.
The employers Kershuu, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
No compensation is payable.
During the Second World War, shipping, one of the most deadly occupations in contact with asbestos, is developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
The world production of asbestos grows to over 4,213,000 tons a year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
The use of asbestos is forbidden in Britain.
The act on mesotheliomy was adopted in Britain.
The compensation scheme of $350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but asbestos are still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to vengeance
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a course is likely to commence long-declared protests in Hong Kong's business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing in the few hours after that statement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress in fact enables Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't deceive our expectations, but it's still raging," said Legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They deceived Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Defending China ' s decision, Lee Fay, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress, said that it would be too “haotous to allow the popular election of Hong Kong leader”.
Since 1997, when Britain handed over Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the inhabitants of the region to choose by vote the head of Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gave the Hong Kong the right to direct vote; but the decision also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands through the Beijing-controlled candidates' commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the largest protests that had been heard in Hong Kong over the years had taken place.
Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers threatened to overtake Hong Kong's financial region if Beijing did not guarantee the present universal electoral law, is part of the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the application, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement was moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the weeks to come.
However, they did not provide details, evidently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, which can only be taken if all the opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and no other choice.
We are very regrettable to report that to date all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
The government authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures were strengthened at the Government headquarters on Sunday with the involvement of the police and barricad.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstrations are at risk of Hong Kong’s business source of life.
“The protest they speak of can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said Legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be disturbed that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is detrimental to investment.
China ' s State media also provided reports in the last days in which the Hong Kong democratic movement activists were shown by the diversants directed by the western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
U.S. Graduation Cultural Across has come to university life: first trainers have been invited to arriving on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by starting the first "lux" service in Britain for current students.
In order to give a strong impression of the arrival of a university, the company also proposes such transport options as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The representative of the company said that since the service had just been launched, no orders had been received, but he added that “students would start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay $9,000 per year, she hoped to find a market for this service.
Nowadays students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago with regard to expectations and hopes: more important than ever to make a perfect first impression, and VIF is exactly what is needed to do.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as being excluded from reality.
Megan Dann, Vice-President of the National Higher Education Institute, said, “The project seems incredibly cut off from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university studies this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the fast-growing costs of basic needs before they can even start thinking about getting thousands of pounds out for something like a simple arrival in the community.
Feminists raise the issue of race and conduct of the police after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, scanding, "Rooks up, don't shoot," while they're waiting in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri about the murder of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoil Pérez noticed a shift in the internet talk among white feminists.
According to her experience, the white feminists left the commentaries placed a gender above the race when it was about promoting reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as the tensions in the Middle West increased and attracted national attention, Pérez saw the responses of white women, which focused 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the death of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as “Ferguson's thoughts on the face of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for the Peres they showed a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about white skin color and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic for the crisis we've faced and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so linked to race, they felt they needed to point out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio Corita, Mitchell Ferguson, he has revealed the problems that black Americans face every day but are not perceived as “women's problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I'll get 150 rabbits everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence deafense.
"Why are women safe to talk publicly about relations, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face difficult reality every day.
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in the Feminist mayor, Angela Hatteri, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“In the years 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were leaning, and the basis for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,” said Hatter.
A white woman was needed to confirm the story in order to justify the lynching.
From the point of view of Hathter, the gap between white and black women took place when white Sufrasists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and found that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or black people.
“They have decided to put all eggs in the basket of the voice for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later,” said Hatter.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear picture of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against the linguistics of the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynchations.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise of the white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation -- police behaviour, racial discrimination -- reflects the time when white feminists had to “treat” the problems faced by black women in several generations.
"Would it be great if the activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious as the right to raise a child as they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
The famous white Gloria Staine feminist activist, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans participate more in the protests on racism.
“I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and the viewpoints on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys - will be at the head of change”, wrote Stanem.
Although Stanem is given for more cross-feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, some are still surprised by her comments on the race in America.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, the author, "Who Stole Feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but the Stanim remarches about Ferguson are contrary to the criticism she had spoken earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small programme, “My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and spanish youths, many feminists, including Gloria Stanem, responded rage.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that advances the traditional feminism line.
After the U.S. border service arrested some 63,000 minors without escort on the southwestern border this year, immigration reform reappeared, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to pose this problem as important to women, she had only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are issued to [among immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house with pigs is sold.
A picture of a house placed for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was shown by a large pig resting in the living room.
Sales for $120,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on the private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was given by a picture of the living room, where a pig with its head resting on the couch was pictured.
The Connelles Real Estate Agency reported that the pig in the photograph is the household favorite of the owner of the house.
“The photograph has been posted by mistake and has already been removed,” reported the representative of the company.
In a detailed description of the house, Connelles described the former assembly house as “a unique, separate house with one bedroom”.
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it was still in advertising materials.
The sale of the house was of interest in social networks, where some asked whether pigs were sold with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharapova, in the fourth U.S. circle of Open, who has retreated by Carolyn Vozniakka, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year worthy and try to get to a new level, transmits from New York Vasili OSIPOV.
How do you generally measure your results on the "Big Helmet" tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won Rolan Harros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially in the ends of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn't reach a quarterfinal.
What are your tasks before the end of the season?
After a offended defeat, I have a huge motivation to move to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year worthwhile.
The Asian tournament series begins in a couple of weeks.
Member of the Committee of the State for Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former peace champion Nicolas Valuev proposed to give bonuses to the rules of the GTO when entering tuition.
He said that as a whole the norm would be the same as in Soviet times, people would give up the standards of prolongation, run and other exercises.
Remember, 12 Russian entities will begin implementing the GTO rules on their territory as of 1 September.
I also offered to the schoolchildren who had given up the GTO to give bonuses when they went to school, noted Valhuev.
For example, they may be able to add some points to EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional outputs to enterprises that have been tested for sports.
In Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire came up after a lottery winner.
The player in Harvey's lottery this month.
We're looking for a new millionaire southwest of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from a lottery play on Saturday night.
The Kyosque newspaper in Harvey brings gold in the main prize for the second time in five years, and the last win is $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to be declared.
Steve Forward, the owner of the bench, said that the winner caused a raffle in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city talks about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought it might be a secret winner.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the prize winning last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the player from Kenning Weyle became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million winner of the Belmont couple just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and has reported that the winner has given them the opportunity to travel around the world and to buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million.
Minor development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and will tell the Deputy Minister of the Department of Oleg Plujnikov on a round table held in Moscow Automobile Salone 2014.
The plan has been drafted on behalf of the Government, one of the main objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September and early October, says Plujnikov, proposed measures relating to electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gasomatic fuel vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy is available in the Statements) is calculated for 2014-2017.
The criteria for evaluating electrical and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The report to the Government, which will describe the tax and customs support measures for electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and concessional leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals for the reduction of the price of machines, the promotion of localization and service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, changes are expected to be made to regulations to facilitate the construction of charge infrastructures ( parking, logging and other).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for the regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of advantages in the movement and parking, for example; and for February 2016, and proposals for increased public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will provide a list of evaluation indicators for regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of support for clean transport production and the development of charge infrastructure.
The market for electricity in Russia is now only being formed - in 2013, about 100 electric cars have been sold throughout the country.
In early 2014, the import duties for electric cars were cancelled, so the sales would be about 500 pieces, and the Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov, predicted.
However, the five-fold growth does not make electric cars noticeable: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
Only Mitsubishi Motors imports to Russia.
Renault is preparing imports - the company is focusing primarily on corporate clients, says the Director for Strategic Planning and Renault Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
Most of the other electrical transport producers have taken an excellence against Russia.
The development of electric cars is also available by Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, " but the release is shallow.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to the ASM-Holding data, AutoWAS produced 30 electric cars.
The demand is not high due to the cost of electric cars, recognizes the director of AutoWaze for Engineering Sergei Amanas, without the predominant breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to the roadways of the cars (the electric vehicles sold in Russia are, on average, twice as expensive as the internal combustion engines) hampers the undeveloping of the charge infrastructure (funds - units), and sighs up the director of Autostat, Sergei Elicov.
Because of the expensive and low rates of low cost reduction of electric vehicles, the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts Mikhail Podrian's chief editor, and agrees with it.
On the contrary, autoproducers say that some models of electric cars are already close to the value of normal vehicles.
The Russian electricity market has good prospects, most importantly building confidence in consumers that “electromobility” is real; this will, inter alia, contribute to the emergence of all new charge stations, stresses the President of the BMW group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Infrastructure projects, such as the Rosseti State: several stations are built in Moscow, and some 80 more will soon be built.
Negotiations on the construction of the supply chain are ongoing with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofine, director of the Rossetai Department, the company believes in the electricity market and is ready to construct gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for electric charges of various brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so with regard to electrical charges is being developed.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the domineering of the Russian power-driven market to curb customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, the expansion of the concessional list is being considered.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environmental (the idea discussed and concerned with all cars) would also support the market, but not as tangible as the customs preferences, Pankov considered.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where the tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in the sales of electric cars - now accounted for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, there is also a need for incentives for owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as already made in Moscow), assured by Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on selected strips, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private aircraft crashed in Colorado
Piper PA-46, a single-motor aircraft, crashed in Colorado, the United States.
Three of the five people in it are dead, transmitting ITAR TASS.
The survivors are taken to the hospital.
An accident occurred several kilometres from the Denver airport offshore.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In the Donetsk region, the Donbass battalion is dealt with with prisoners.
The caravans were surrounded by Ilowaski.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of Forcesmen were killed under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in South-East of Ukraine really was, they would not have gone to war.
108 prisoners can be described as lucky.
The cartels from the Donbas battalion were alive after the mess that they got under Ilovaski.
In the context of the Donetska People ' s Republic, the fighters spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When reported from the headquarters that the ring could come out of the corridor, the convoy moved.
But literally in a few minutes, the shells and bullets are all over the world.
"After the information given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out, and the deputy commander of the battalion with the call "Lermont".
And when we descended between the Polywood and the Red Rural, a cross-fire from anti-tank controlled missiles, from the "Bitch" grenades of 30 millimeter, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
Four cars and three in the back, leaving only two cars.
The officer with the call "Lermont" says: almost immediately, at least 60 people died, dozens were wounded, many died afterwards.
The surviving militants are now providing medical assistance to those who have come to kill.
Now prisoners are astonished that so-called terrorists treat them well, give food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and condemned them to death.
We've been betrayed simply, they say.
The colon, the whole battalion to be destroyed.
At the Donbass battalion, like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered because the Ukrainian news was about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east of the Separatists.
Alexey already saw a different picture here.
His mother was murdered in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar shooting, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were on the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, and the report has already written about the care.
From Zurakov's collections, we were immediately taken to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in Kothle under Iloways.
Some survivors now admit that if time could be reversed, they would not enter the punitive battalion for anything.
All imprisoned militia were handed over to the DNR Forces.
Each person will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
A food price-limiting headquarters has been established in the region
In the Red Sea, a headquarters has been established, which will limit the growth of food prices in the region's market as necessary.
The establishment of this structure has already been signed.
Members of the Government of the province, the executive and supervisory offices were included in the headquarters.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the land.
Is the Economy going to reimburse the Kiev Rosnefti $140 million?
The Head of Rosnefti, Igor Secin, stated that the company was assessing the damage to the Lishican NHRI fire in Ukraine at $140 million.
He reported this in the Spiegel interview.
“We are assessing the damage of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation,” said Secin.
He said that the implementation of the newly renewed NHRIs was planned in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fights, there were no "cooped rebels", but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil was lost in the trumpets," he said.
Remember, on 18 July, in connection with the bombing of the Lisican NHRI, the oil reservoir was burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisican NHRI, the major refinery factory in Ukraine, was first introduced in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisican NHRI is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The factory is capable of producing Euro-4 fuel, as well as the disfuels of Euro-5.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisican NHRI was suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start repairing.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisican NHRI, together with other Ukrainian TNC-XB assets.
The DPRK launched a small distance shell towards the Japanese sea.
According to the South Korean media, this occurred about 10:30 a.m. by local time from Chagando Province, which is at the Nordic border of Korea and China.
According to Interfaxu at the Joint Committee of South Korean Chiefs of Staff, a missile was allegedly dropped into the Japanese sea after some 220 kilometres had flown.
Roll falls in the background of geopolitical pressure
In the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3 copies to 37.15 roubles, and the rouble fell to a basket in the background of geopolitical tension.
The dollar trades on ETC have been launched by transactions at the borders of 37.11 to 37.2 rubbish/$1, on average in two minutes the rate is 37.16 rubbish/$1, which is 4 copies above the previous closure level.

The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He went on cheap and rouble and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are already taking precedence over the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, this is more like an artificial hysterics that is spilled through the media, especially the western.
The options for the introduction of new sanctions against the FM are not so many.
TeleTrade " At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the basket basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determinant.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, and Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be tried with the Ideal tour.
The Orenburg Airlines filed an Ideal tour with a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
These two cases will be held in October.
There will be a variety of judges to consider the cases.
According to Interfax, the first complaint was filed on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million roubles.
The meeting on it was appointed to be held on 7 October.
The second statement was submitted on 18 August.
It's $4.24 billion roubles.
The meeting on it was appointed to be held on 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union, tourist judges have been appointed differently.

Victor Zükin, airman, tells us about 1.6 billion roubles.
The Aerophlot's Hector, Vitaly Saveliev, calls an even greater sum, two billion roubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting to new users
The Twitter microblogs tools have changed the process of user registration to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now the new Twitter users will be looking at a large number of read-outs recommended by the accountant to form their own reading circle immediately.
The recommendations shall be based on the interests specified in the registration.
Twitter automatically sets the subscription checkbox for all automatically selected accounts.
That's why the user will have to take off the checkers on his own so he won't read those who are not interested in him.
If the users of the microblogging service had seen only the avatars of recommended users before, then Twitter now takes out a sample of one of the popular blogger's tweets to help make the impression of a person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily linked to continuing attempts by the service to achieve emptiness.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in reader's activity.
At present, the company desperately needs more loyal consumer resources that will remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be graceful and rainy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, reports by meteorologists.
The air temperature in Moscow will be between 16 and 18 degrees and 13-18 degree submarines.
When the weather cloud is cleared, the rain will pass, the east quarter wind will be quite faint -- just 3-8 meters per second.
Automobile disposal programme resumed as of 1 September.
Since 1 September, the automobiles programme has been renewed in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF Denis Mantourov, money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF by redistribution from other support areas.
The programme concerns all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation will be from 40,000 per car to 350,000 roubles per freight.
Previously, a similar vehicle disposal programme has been in place in Russia.
The Minister explained the main difference in the current project in the fact that it is not only expected to dispose of cars to be discounted, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of over six years, to acquire a new one with a discount on the remission of an old one to the “triid-in” at the dealer, transmits Interfax.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent on the previous federal programme of disposal, which was in force from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
As a result, the level of car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent in relation to 2009).
Creator Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalists
Heymdiziner Nicky Case, famous Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalist.
He told me about his project in Kill Screen interview.
Case began to play a few weeks ago, but the fact was widely known only now.
The inspiration for the game was that of Ferguson, where protests started after the police killed an unarmed black adolescent.
In the focus of the project, which has no titles to date, there will be a way in which information about stories affects their impact.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will have to take pictures of events in areas where the police and the population are confronted.
The hero can take a picture of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protesters are gangsters, the police will start to treat it better and let it go where the ordinary person can't go.
If he's illuminated differently, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
Eyes in the game will need to be obtained using a tweeter of a hero, where new subscribers will appear if the photographs appear popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of exit and the platforms on which it appears is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photograph was made and processed.
Kill Screen Case explained that he had thought about the concept of such a game a long time ago, but originally wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip, not protests in the United States.
After he started collecting the game material, he realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to highlight the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media reporting events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on the basis of what happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
The most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about Case’s bisexual history, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to explain his relationship to homophobic parents.
Helete's pulling Ukraine into the bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” victims by the Ukrainian Minister of Defence, Valerie Helete, is prosecuting the people in the continuation of the bloodshed, as stated in the report of the MID RF.
“In Moscow, of course, they drew attention to the comments made by the head of the Ukrainian military department of Valerie Helethei, who declared “the completion of an operation to free the east of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the great domestic war, which would be “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the post on his page in Facebook, is a subject for a study of non-military professionals”, says a report by Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of the civilized State.
On his page in Facebook, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “In informal channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if they continue to resist, they are willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He stated, however, that “the liberation of the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Reese Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 stars of Hollywood have been horrified.
Hackers hacked the primitive passwords in the iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the Blogger Rese Hilton website.
It's not for long.
Recall that Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the star “Hungry Games”, had already reported theft of photographs from her cell phone, and had confirmed that all the images that “shone” in the Network were real.
Re-Hilton, the one-named tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, nobody made me do that.
Their agents didn't contact me.
And now I'm going to remove the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justis," wrote a blogger in Twitter.
However, all frank photographs of the stars have already flew around the network.

Tony Stewart is suffering the accident, returning to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart hit the wall the second time after its right front tyre broke down on 172 circles, putting an end to its presentation.
Stuart took his cracked car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
Chad Johnston, leader of his team, said that 14 team members are upset, but will now focus on the race for the next weekends in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully we'll do better.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race Sunday night after a clash with Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty great hope to come to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart was evacuated, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASSAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the groundway race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week, and he had to win either Atlanta, or the next race in Richmond to take part in the prosecution.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident, which resulted in the death of Kevin Ward Jr., who had left the road to express displeasure to Stuart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was taken whether Stuart would be charged.
The threefold champion was met with loud voices and applause when presented before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stuart walked at the beginning of the race at the beginning of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then 122 circles after the restart number Bush.
The car 18 went from the trajectory to the 2st turn and hit Stuart by pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but he's back to position 21.
Sweetzak and Wittorgan have breakfast with Gwanetsky in Odessa.
Xenia Sobcach and Maxim Vitorg are now in Odessa, which the television guide did not fail to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprised and embarrassed by the worshipers of the couple.
The picture is from Gwanetsky.
"In breakfast Mikhail Mikhalych Jwanetsky Maxim explains what instagrams are:) #odessa," signed the photo of Xenia Sobczak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no bucket, no oil, no other...
The couple’s worshippers decided that Kswash was also smoking, and they condemned her for it.
"And whose cigarettes?, "Curse kills!", "What a cigarette breakfast," "Although for breakfast, and only cigarettes on the table)) ", "Kenya, you're also smoking?", aroused your lover's subscribers to her blog.
Remember, Subczak had recently been chased by what a tasted dinner had prepared for her for the first time in her life by Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happiness is when you come to a date, and your husband has prepared dinner for your arrival, which is how good it is. Now at the end of the dinner, I say, "that's what every day it's like," and I'm fond of my husband, Xenia Sobcach.
The picture shows that Maxim's trying to cook something, and there's a salt and baked chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return the previous working conditions that had recently been changed.
Increased salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the Interim Acting Minister of Justice, Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested symbolically against the new schedule of work, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials had met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement had been reached, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations continue, reported to the GNL Head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of the Penalties of Rosen Jelmen.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ministry of the Interior staff are expected to join in protesting the union of prison officials.
The new Government of Thailand is under the control of the army
General Praut (right) appointed the Minister of Defence of the Government of Vongswan (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-Ocha, announced the composition of a new Cabinet of Ministers in which more than one third of the posts were held by generals or generals in resignation.
The military has received key positions: ministers of defence, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-Ocha was formally approved as Prime Minister following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of a head of the Interim Military Government to that post.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the unblood coup d ' état on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a meeting of Parliament.
Previously, the army appointed parliamentary deputies.
According to Prauta Chan-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by a six-month demonstration that required the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat.
The officially Praita Chan-Ocha will be a temporary premiere, as the military is planning to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there is concern that the military are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
In the background of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the major political parties were arrested temporarily.
Immediately after the entry into power of the military, they were temporarily arrested by the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglek Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also delayed.
The current political crisis is at the root of 2006 when the army relocated from the post of Prime Minister Brother Yinglek Chinavat Tacsin.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern parts of the country, which has made them successful in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elite have entered an anti-governmental movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said it would be better in the Midian salad, I didn't promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm braceser.
It has to be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and the stomach remain steady.
Because everyone knows long ago that we're saying "Belgium," we mean Midias, we say "midias" -- "Belgium."
Restorators like to say in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and location.
There are other places that are not good, not even great, but some kind of unhappy.
Shortly after arriving at the table of Palm, I remembered that once there was a "Hordock" cafe here, then Odessa Mama, and a "Bojole" restaurant and a beer "Broadbah."
Now there's a beer but nostalgic-sow, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg was placed on the ground: a bar stake and a pair of tables, all the rest of the space was deprived of even a hint of sunlight.
It's fun here, like in a child's room: red, yellow and green walls, colored chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where girls swim.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been in novelty, so there is a comparison with what.
There are eight species of spilled beer (260-300 roubles per 0.5 litres) and a countless number of bottles (170-1550 roubles).
The company-positive waitress has a fun presentation of the menu, telling us that "midies are rich seeds," and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected for content, but often very unexpectedly.
Well, for example, it's predictable that a carpachio carpalette with a wool rod (280 roubles) is actually so thin that the parchment paper would seem unimaginably fat than it is.
You can only feel some taste if you're warmed together by the pancakes.
The salads are even worse.
The classic ice (260) would be the right thing to admit as a crime against the Belgian people: some blasphemy iceberg, a long-standing potato that has oxidized the Kenyan beans, garbage chips from the bacon, and what a marinated bow for.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a ice salad!
The composition of Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If the inexperienced quarters of the tomatoes of the tomatoes or the overcrowded champion can still be closed, why the Midians look like a few times they have been freezing and retreating in their lives!
I already know that there's normal white-month mussels here!
They are placed in the sauce for your choice (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauce, that of white wine, seldery and carrots, was not frank.
The vegetables are eaten, and the fragrance is missing, and whether it was wine there, it's still a mystery.
Well, well, the Midian Frito's home mayo.
The chicken vaterse here is not a basket so thick that, depending on your mood, you can decide, the first or second dish is in front of you, but just a nice wet soup.
The rabbit was said to be cooked in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the Rosemary.
At the turn, the situation was diametrically opposite: the marine was numbing everything.
It seemed that this rabbit had been feeding solely with lodging bushes, and the meat had acquired such an unusual fragrance.
But at the same time, the rabbit's knife was adjacent to a beautiful -- no, no, just abnormal pearl in a caramelized short.
Waffley in Palm offers not only sweet but also salt with beef, chicken or bacon (220-280).
The clay sauce was overly watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager approaching the table was very informally interested in lunch impressions.
So you should come again.
The dollar was higher than 37 roubles on news of new West sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The “day” dollar, by 10:29, rose by 26.9 rods and was 37.02 roubles, and the euro was raised by 30 copies, to 48.73 rubles, as evidenced by the Moscow Exchange.
The basket grew by 28 coppers to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the criminal events, the dollar reached a maximum of 19 February 2009, at that time it cost 36.43 roubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was now 37.005 roubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that President Barak Obama and Chancellor of Germany, Angel Mercel, discussed the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
Reducing the ruble is long-term, coupled with the euro and coupled with the dollar.
A long-term projection foresaw this mark, says Anna Bodrova's senior analyst "Alpary."
Everything that's connected to Ukraine will be reflected in courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumours of military invasion are not confirmed on the one hand, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the conversations about his resistance to such news were overheard yesterday.
The expert's projected week will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the transit of gas across Ukraine, all of which are links of one chain.
Inflation is also projected, with 5 to 10 per cent added to current autumn prices.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will be completed and a vacuum will come as the networks reorientate to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the 37 roubles mark, passed it, and returned, there's no powerful hysterics," comments the head of the Market Analysis Division of the Broker Opening of Constant Bushuev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday as NATO meets.
He said that Rubl had been severely weakened since the end of the tax season, and then news had been sent to Ukraine, and the CB had stated last week that by the end of the year it was moving completely to a floating rate and refused any currency intervention.
If you look at day fluctuations, it was nothing different from the previous one during this month, everyone was frightened by 37 roubles, and the analyst continues.
Well, there's nothing powerful about the circulation.
An alarming time for the currency market was remembered when, at the end of January, an increased demand for currencies and the third March, when the CB had shipped the record amount of the currency.
In UFS IC, there is also a positive side of the deterioration of the rouble.
First of all, this is an increase in the export revenues budget, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers through imports, says the main analysis of UFS IC, Alexei Koszlov.
The travel of import goods and services may be considered negative.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, increase inflationary pressures and, as a result, cause the borrowing of money, which in turn hinders the development of the country's economy.
In terms of the share market, the depreciation of the rouble has slightly reduced the decline in the share prices expressed in the roubles.
For example, the IMB index declined by 1.67 per cent in Thursday and the RTS index lost 3.27 per cent.
The significant difference in the relative extent of the reduction of indices is due to the lowering of the rouble during the day by more than 1.5 per cent.
Reducing the rouble is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy currency.
As practice suggests, emotions are gradually declining, and rubble rolls are partially or completely restored.
"We believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency close to 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic infringement is often misdiagnosed
British reported that she had spent many years thinking she would die after the wrong diagnosis.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she was left to live just a few years after she had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had Sharco-Marie-Tuta (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders, which result in nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK charitable organization reported that the wrong diagnosis was a common problem among people with CMT because it was so little known.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are expected to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unscrupulous walk and clutched fingers.
The sufferers may feel overwhelmed or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that the symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the Fredreich attack, a state for which the prediction was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child I couldn't do what others did.
I was falling every day, and I had more time.
I've never been able to roll or skateboard with other kids, and I've had a lot of fun at school because I went and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to free achilles and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical map when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I had put my nose down, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and felt the worst panic I could ever do.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I get 25, and that I'll gradually lose all my abilities in this gap.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and hug me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you'd have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she found CMT.
"When he explained what the CMT is, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The British CMT charitable organization announced a month of information on CMT to try to attract attention to this disease.
The tax burden on the Washington Zone is increasing as the economy is restored
Recovering the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
The state and local tax accounts for companies throughout the country have increased moderately last year when economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the company in the Washington Zone is no exception.
The company in the district, Maryland and Virginia aggregately paid $27.6 billion in the State and locally in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the amount of 26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on business both the state and the local level increased last year by 4.3 per cent, to 671 billion dollars, compared with 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after the years that followed when the accounts decreased in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study by a professional service provider, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the tax policy team.
More than half of the district tax revenue, 56 per cent, accounted for business taxes, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenues were made by firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the lowest tax revenue, proportionately from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenue is due to the return to the still real estate value of companies, researchers say, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 per cent this year after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these income is accounted for in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is true in the Washington Zone.
The company in the district, Maryland and Virginia aggregately paid $10 billion for real estate taxes at the state and local level last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent than in the previous year.
However, the noticeable return to real estate does not have any similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
The Virginia and the Colombian County are paying about half of the state and local taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the Columbia County, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes to pay the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be entirely explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurial revenues also appear to be corrected according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, a $2.1 billion higher than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income from the income tax, most in the region.
While trends are in one direction, local entrepreneurs' tax burdens are not increasing at the same speed in all three locations.
The growth rate in Colombia was the same as in the country average, 4.3 per cent, while in Maryland growth was substantially faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were rising below the average of 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (equivalent to each corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A similar study of the United States Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and generally a more favourable climate for business taxes than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in the study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia has a competitive pressure from its neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed a legislative act reducing the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate falls to 5 per cent next year.
If the State continued to meet the tax goals next year, this law could lead to a rate of income tax for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, the small business in the Washington Zone seems to be feeling better and thus pays more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid as individual income taxes by small business owners - a transitional structure where most small firms - in the district of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia - have increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in revenues from business taxes throughout the country will likely continue this year, with taxes from the state and local governments that have risen by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging, as the reduction of federal expenditures affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
A world championship of judo brought two silver and seven bronze prizes to the assembly of Russia.
By this figure, the Russians retracted only from Japan’s main favorite competitions.
The tournament in Chalabinsk started on Monday, and the first day it brought a silver medal to the Russian team.
She was the owner of Beslan Wythan, who served as a category up to 60 kg.
However, in the same final fight against Baldbaatar, Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the opposition was only one comment received by the Russian man.
And then the second day of the tour was the most successful for the assembly of Russia -- on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In male competitions, up to 66 kg silver reached Mikhail Puleev and Bronza Kamalah Khan Magomedov.
In the final unit, the Russians compromised the 2011 and 2013 world championship to Masashi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who had lost his fellow countryman at the fourth stage, had won a comforting tournament and had become the holder of the bronze award.
In the female category tournament up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzutin also received a third degree of pedestal honor.
In semi-final she lost the current Kelmendi Peace Championship from Kosovo, which was the flag of the International Federation of Judo and successfully protected the title.
Ma Inanh of China won the Chinese bronze of Kuzutin, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
Again, Kelmendi was a barrier to the gold that had conquered Kuzutin earlier in the final part of the European championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, a bronze in a collection of Russians was placed by Musa Mouchkov, who fought in category up to 73 kg.
In fourth, his offender became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skovorzas, who is now in charge of the OAU team.
However, the Russians then won two fights and became the prize.
The mighty spoke at the home championship with the trauma of a hotel, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he'll take a pause in the competition.
As for the ex-moldovanine Squortsov, he and he got to the bronze medal on this tournament.
Interestingly, the other member of his country, who accepted the AEA sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko and Bronze had completed his statement in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of PM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which, in category up to 81 kg, had won Ivan Nifont.
In a heavy battle of the small finish, he won French Alan Schmitt by the rival's comment.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were played on the tournament, but Russians traditionally restricted one bronze in a male tournament to 90 kg.
Cyril of Questions became its owner, and this medal was guaranteed by Russia: his rival at the soothing final was the co-facilitator of Cyril Denisov.
However, there was no contravention: the rival of the Questionnaire was unable to go to my dads because of the injury.
The man's bronze was conquered by the owners and, on the sixth day of the competition, she was placed in a collection stamp by Renaut Saidov, a category of over 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he gained a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
This ended the individual part of the world’s primaryity.
On the last day of the tournament in Chalabinsk, Sunday, the world's champions were played in team competitions.
Both Russian gatherings - both male and female - were one of the main claims for the awards, but as in individual competitions, they were not fortunate for the representatives of the beautiful sex - they did not reach the medal.
Russian judolists have won the crew.
In a decisive fight against the 2-3 account, they retreated the main favourites of the Japanese team.
At the same time, the Russian assembly led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and the military, Denis Yartsov (up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier categories with its Japanese rivals, Murat Habatirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Asen Cambiev (100) were unable to cope.
The same scenario was followed by a bronze match in a women's tournament, where the Russian collection, leading 2-0, retreated to Japan - 2-3.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia attended the team competitions in Chelabinsk, who, after the tournament, congratulated the male silver assembly.
"The second place is a very honorable place, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be champions," said Putin, whose words leads RIA News.
It's not a big thing. It's not a big deal.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian Congregation at the World Home Championship was much better than a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
At the time, there were only three medals in the Russian team, one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament had missed the Olympic Champions of Arsen Galstian and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person enters the Olympic Cycle in eight of the strongest, he's a potential winner of Olympics.
The more sports like judo”, the Tournament Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutoko, quoted as the press service of the championship.
Japan’s gathering was expected to be better in Chelabinsk, gaining 11 medals of different dignity, five of which were golden.
The next world champion will be held in the summer of the next year in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers was unconscious of the arrival of a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that 81-year-old actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in the statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart stop at the East Island clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, reports sources.
The doctors deliberately hold her under the drug and under strict surveillance until she is satisfied with her condition, which remains “critical”.
The response was broad, including numerous support on the Internet from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everybody can get the kings.
In the sale of the Royal Blood Group album, the new hope of British rock douettes from the clubs to the stadiums.
The Duette Royal Blood is on the stage only a year, but already has an act of nomination on the BBC music prize, the Arctic Monkeys tour and the New York concert Grimme from Jimmy Payge himself.
Their debate single album was awarded 100,000 prejudgements a few months before the release, and the contract for its release is in the Warner Music portfolio.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, the situation from a number of outlets is not the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet voice to the “new R'n'B” representative, but the duet of British prostitutes playing with the volume and intensity that was last in the fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album rates for all the aforementioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been justified.
It's not for good to take the name that may have been intimidated before, except that it's already desperate, hairy metallists, and the blood of which the kings flows, they seem to have in their veins, is also understandable.
This is, of course, especially about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like a large quartet, the Royal Blood aims to stir up the stagnant blood of the British rock by bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise is still, perhaps, early, but something can be argued already.
Ten of the songs that were set in 30 minutes are not as much a demonstration of phenomenal compositorial gift as a credible and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say the "Out of the Black" is characterized by what is remembered, not by the melodic line, but by the drum party.
Musicians joke to say that this song is easier to knock than sing.
The "Little Monster" and the closing plate of "Better Strangers" with the Shakespeare quote in the title are also worth highlighting.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound beautifully at a party of heavy rock lovers, but when playing in a row, they blend into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that doesn't necessarily have to be bad, even the opposite.
The power of the Royal Blood is that they do not claim to be the lavas of the new Lennon and McCartney (who will soon see Motörhead's successors), but they have taken many rock doets out of the ghetto indi clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, has been created for stadiums, and it is evidently close in a room designed for fewer than a few thousand people.
The secret is partly the tricky use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the usual format created at the beginning of the zero White Stripes.
It's not only about tools, it's also about writing songs.
The guards of the nucleus were hard to choose beyond the post-modern paradigm, reluctantly reluctantly going to admit themselves not just to epigons, but to self-sustaining creative units.
The Royal Blood now sounds so powerful that it has succeeded in draping some secondaryity and firmness of musical material.
And finally, who said the rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON has just confirmed what the Information reported on Friday morning: Online and video producer and a hundred other things are buying a Twitch stream video service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Google's Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and it seemed natural.
Twitch, based only three years ago like Justin.tv, set the goal of being a common stream service - the version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where geymers broadcast their inner play moments; "YouTube for real-time games," says Business Insider.
Interfeice Twitch.
And the "let's play", a video genre where all-know-knowledge games are (mainly, old) processing games like the "The Theater" are already popular on YouTube.
The case is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube is getting a twitch was met without special interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reported that he was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have right now is a statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shire, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobbers like me who claim that they're better going to do sport than watch it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking into their hands the joysticks.
One thing is to watch a friend's shoulder at 3 p.m. when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and it's quite another to watch a stranger gets 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so to watch them, without controlling the angle of their own eyes, can be a prescription of the headache worth it right.
I agree that the early passages in which Rogers Bennisters of our e-century end the whole games in a record time are being amused.
But if it's not about game or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting at all.
But what do the skeptics know like me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would turn to Amazon Instant Video just as elegant as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would enjoy: crowds of young men about whom advertisers dream.
As Head Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said "boys believe in the future games," and this channel doesn't show signs of draining, even, oh, like a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, died as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages, almost all of them now, with the parents of the dead, with the watchman of the cemetery, the city of Angels, Ramon Caspolatov, the head of the Committee of Susana Dudiava, who took part in a special operation by a member of the MFS, relates to Elizabeth Antonov, a reporter of the Community, who worked on a special project.
Upon returning to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who was a president ' s adviser for the North Caucasus 10 years ago and had negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the FSB 'V ' , Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this subject is that it's like there weren't those ten years in Beslan.
This subject is extremely painful for all who have anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
A special project has been prepared by a study of chaling Rambler & Co, which has been working with a company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and Vladimir Putin's 15th anniversary to power.
DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small distance missile in the Japanese sea, reports Renghap.
The launch was made at about 10:30 a.m. by local time by Chagando Province, located at the border of North Korea and China.
The missile was likely to fall into the Japan Sea, flying about 220 kilometres, and declared at the Joint Committee of South Korea Chiefs of Staff.
Deputies proposed to expedite the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
If the initiative succeeds, data from Russians will not be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law has been introduced to the General Assembly, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law on personal data of the Russians, from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative framework of the lower chamber.
It was sponsored by the Deputies of the Lord Wadim Lagin, Jaroslav Nylov (LDPR), Eugenius Fedorov ("The Single Russia"), Vladimir Parajin (the Justice Russia) and Alexander Yuschenko (CRC).
This change, in the view of the authors of the initiative, will contribute to the speedier and more effective provision of the rights of citizens of the RF to the security of personal data and to the secrecy of correspondence in the communication networks.
The entry into force by parliamentarians requires that the personal data of Russians processed via the Internet be kept in the territory of the RF.
It also makes the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, refinement and extraction of personal data from citizens of the RF, in databases located in Russia, and the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskománazor the right by court decision to limit access to information processed in violation of RF legislation in the area of personal data.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called black lists of offenders - an automated information system entitled “Personal Information Register”.
This law was enacted by the Lord in summer.
The Bill was sponsored by Andrey Lugova and Vadim Lagyn of LDPR and Alexander Yuschenko of CRC.
Money and Yuschenko are also one of the sponsors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have a date center at the RF will have to pay for rental.
Commenting today on the draft draft law of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see the problem of the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that would not have their own personal data stores in Russian territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to lease them, such as the “Rostellekoma”, who repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and already provided their servers, Mail Group, to Western companies that now provide their servers.
“There are also several independent date-centres ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the RF, I do not see any problems, they will have technological opportunities for accommodation”, Levin substantiated.
Fraud bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services if the bill was adopted.
In particular, it is an online booking of air tickets and hotels.
In the view of the association, “the legal project deprives persons of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to manage their own data imperially to determine that their recording, systematization, etc., must be ensured only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a mechanism for informing the user of the location of the record, to systematicize its personal data.
In such a case, it will be possible to choose the territory where those actions would be carried out.
Such "localization" bills in other countries have led to the withdrawal of global services and significant economic losses.
A participant in the test of the icewater bear raised his jaw
Isabelle Roberts, in Britain, screamed so much when she was exposed to icewater that her face’s bones were damaged.
The test of the icewater breeze went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the test of the icewater bear that her jaw was lifted up.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so ruthlessly when her head was poured out with ice water, which damaged her face’s structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did it, my jaw began to stuck," she said to the Mirror.
It's 20 years old.
Isabel Roberts a second before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't shut up, he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
The same understanding came to my mother and sister and they began to horn, but I had to go to the emergency office urgently.
A 20-year-old woman from the United Kingdom was taken to hospital to exercise her jaw after having taken part in popular admiration on Tuesday.
Clip became an online sanction and published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militias handed over over 400 prisoners to Ukrainian military
In the Army of Novorossia, it is alleged that the Ukrainian Su-27 has been killed and that the enemy is accused of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10:00 on 1 September, the militia handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 deceased soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax, a representative of the Press Service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that “the air defences in the area of the Mereška area have destroyed the Su-27 aircraft that violated ceasefire agreements”.
According to an agency interlocutor, the Ukrainian side in the shelling of the Yuhan Airport applied cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press noted that two Ukrainian military helicopters had been damaged by the militia in the night at one of the field airfields, as well as the destruction of two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
“The loss of the enemy's life - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered to 13 people,” the representative of the headquarters summarized.
Interfax does not have evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “national republics” Donbassa announced that 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine were transferred to the Ukrainian side under the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, the DNR army, according to the “Army of Novorossia”, “restrained the Nazis in violation of the earlier arrangements to withdraw heavy equipment from the area of the environment”.
The militias then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in the short run, the seizure of six tanks and the disarming of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, the total loss of an enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansky, Mariulski) during the night was five tanks, eight armoured armoured vehicles, more than 120 killed and wounded
At the end of the past week, a major Ukrainian troop group was surrounded by militia in the Ilovaisk region in Donetsk.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia asked the leadership of the “national republics” to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
The DNR agreed to do so, subject to the surrender of weapons and munitions by an enemy.
The first dozens of soldiers began leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, Donbas Simenchenko, another 14 people left the battalion on the Sunday night of the Kotla.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity of 137 police 32 RF and 9 RF Tank Brigades”, where they are treated well.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Minorities of Russia refuted reports from Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will respond to new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to respond to its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the MID RF.
The Russian Foreign Diplomatic Office reported that the European Council ' s “conclusions” of 30 August had demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their invisible support to the Kyiv authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in the east of Ukraine, based on “absolutely unproved allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country”, says the agency's website.
The MID RF regrets that the European Union, contrary to the interests of its member States, is susceptible to the influence of countries that are interested in increasing confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, as well as the conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing parties”, emphasizes the department.
The agency also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbassa, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has been launched and the number of casualties among the civilian population is increasing.
Recall that specific proposals for sanctions against the FM are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives cooperate closely with American officials.
They are expected to correlate the measures introduced for the period of operation and the degree of stringency.
The new EU sanctions can affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in the sanctions against Russia in the areas of defence, finance and oil-gas industry.
Clean ways to save university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than 1,000 per year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to a second course, has come up with a tricky way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to take books to the top of the class, offering them nominal compensation to postpone their sales.
"My mathematical analysis textbook, usually worth $180, I received a semester for $10 and a chick-fil-A cookie, says Sröder, 19 years old, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature on the last semester would cost $430, says he.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and training supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly picking online stores and creative ideas like the Schroeder system.
The rolling of books is becoming more popular by allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often costs much cheaper than their purchases.
Nibo Incorporated, owned by more than 250 university bookstore, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Studies in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in university book stores during the last spring semester have been taken over, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are acquired at university bookstore, according to a professional association of the National Association of University Commerce.
Here's an introductory course on the best way to make a profitable deal.
Internet shopping
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you'll see in the university book store.
The nineth edition of the Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is worth about $290 for the pre-scourt, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the used
If you don't mind any other person's marks or damages, the textbooks used are a good option.
The mathematical analysis is sold for $93.49 as used on Chegg.com.
Matt Casseday, 25 years old, a fourth course student from the University of Brigham Young, said he paid 42 cents at Amazon.com for a copy of the textbook entitled “Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business”.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Braicey, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to clarify to their professors whether the previous publications could not be used.
Sometimes updates are notсуществable.
In such cases, old editions are often found at a very small share of the value of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc, is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Ripper
You should think about taking the textbooks if you're good enough to treat them, you're not gonna forget to get them back, and you don't want to leave them after the course's finished.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the mathematical analysis to a semester for about $20.
Illustrate the rules of the store where you take books, including any fines that you can make for markings, stresses, and damages.
If you take a book, remember that if you don't return the book, fines can even exceed the value of a new copy.
Electronic books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes, such books are actually taken over by obtaining an electronic license for a period of time from distributions such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The mathematical analysis on Chegg.com's six-month website will cost about $61.
Bracy says that students studying literature can often find the most profitable prices, because many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who is going to start the Pepperdin Law School, recommends that you use ISBN to find out the price of the book because it guarantees that you are looking for the text you need.
Before making an internet order, says Holt, you need to check if the book really is on the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price in the university bookstore.
Putin stated that the development fund for the Far East was ineffective
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, convened a meeting on the primacy of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was ineffective, reports Interfax.
"15 billion roubles are still on deposits," stressed the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State mandated that the list of Territories ahead of development in the Far East be expedited.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TRADE should be introduced to the Lord of the Autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted by the President, has not approved the list of territories ahead of development in the Far East and their criteria by 1 July.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated the main objectives for the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving regional transport accessibility, lifting infrastructure restrictions on both the domestic market and export development.
The President stressed, among other things, the need to create prerequisites to attract additional investment in the region, as well as to form the territories ahead of development, which should become competitive towards the key business centres of ATP.
Recall that it was previously reported that the territory of advance development could be replaced by EEA.
Why "Galax Tracing" couldn't save cash collections.
"Silvester Stalone's incomprehensible 3 earned less than $30 million of their $90 million budget in the United States, while the City of Sin: The woman for whom we should kill has returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The house video with Cameron Diaz only brought $14.6 million to the first weekend, while child films like "How to tie the dragon 2" are also disappointing by the benefit.
The Telegraph Critics, Robbie Collin, points out that when it comes to child films, it may be bad as films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the worst year in history for children's films, and he called "How to get dragon two hardly "functional" the continuation of fentesy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older age, the problem does not seem to be a matter of film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in summer by at least 2,000 copies between May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
Results that take into account the views of both movies and movie critics suggest that the crop of films this year is similar to the size of last year ' s whits.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing visual habits and the growing popularity of Internet stream services such as Netflix.
Registrar John Favro, who is currently working on a fast-starting dysneev film called the Jungle Book, said to Hollywood Reporter's website, "I think times change."
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall in Hollywood, the Netflix revenue from the flow service reached $1.2 billion, almost double the last figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spilberg criticized the studio for relying too much on the franchises of comic books, and predicted Hollywood's "burning."
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy predictions had a share of truth.
In the summer of 2015, several potential caste hetes, including “Mistries: Altron Eras”, “Mignonov” and “Jurish Park”, are expected to be released, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg, a producer of "Peace H" recently called the fall of cash collections "cyclical," said Hollywood Reporter, "The summer coming will be the most cash year in history, and no one will worry about it."
Productive sanctions do not frighten the owners of the establishments with the Caucasus and the Asian meal, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, the common drink has so far preferred to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There's a little salt cucumber than a bad mosquelle," the boss of the Italian Restaurant Barlotti Mariana Valerio is crushed on the quality of raw materials that providers offer him in return to Italians.
Mozarella and the cheese of the burrat ended in the restaurant first, with a short period of storage.
The ferry stores have to be enough for a few months.
What do you do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Doromyl market.
Mariana Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not leave him to date.
The meat was only 30 cm from the floor!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
Then I said, for our restaurant, we'll never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's all changed right now.
But the other day I was brought to a fish trial from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be dead!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man I brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised to learn that many of Italy’s common things are for the Russian producer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hanged in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang away to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get that tender meat?"
I said, "This is yours, Russian."
Why aren't you doing that?
Five minutes of walking from Barlotti in the French Brasserie Most restaurant in the kitchen hangs a stop-leaf, which indicates missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The Chief of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the Strelka bar, Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheese, a restaurant will be purchased by Swiss.
And Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers, "Blood Copper 200 roubles!
I'm asking, "Why, on what basis is she so much worth?"
They say, "Well, we have to earn."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 roubles!
The far-east oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15-20 years, you know how weighed their pants?
At the price, it turns out it's a superdelicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of frightening for foreign cooks.
The typical story is, "The first three months it was okay, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibration and quality.
Many European kitchen restaurants don't know what's going to happen when the raw supplies are over.

The Popup Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed an order to apply certain economic measures to ensure Russia ' s security, which are referred mainly to as food sanctions.
It is prohibited to import beef, pork, meat and subproduct from domestic birds, meat delicatees, fish, mollusks, milk, yogurt, cucumbers, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, colbases and sugar syrups.
The restaurants began with suppliers: prices for food rose, and we urgently need to look for similarities from other countries.
This will have a stronger impact on expensive restaurants with a monochrome of France, Italy, Spain, to which products were delivered directly from the “material” countries.
The company had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when Rossellhodzor banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers supplied beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer 2014 were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which resulted in the ban on Atlantic salmon and trouts, non-Lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and seed bow.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions may still be mitigated.
So far, some of the restaurants exist in uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest HoreC suppliers, the share of imports in the premium was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change their menus under what local farmers and other countries do, says Sergei Mironov, Restorator, Restconsalt.
If the chef's strong, it's not gonna be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks like this, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brasserie Most's restaurant is ready to do that: to give up 10-15% food, to rework half of the menu.
In a mixed kitchen restaurant, dishes, such as marble beef steaks, are already being replaced to beefstrugans, says Sergei Mironov.
“Syres from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, raw materials from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” says Oksana Glybchuk, representative of East-West.
Soils and dairy products from Europe have similarities in Russia and Belarus.
A chicken from the United States can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, a salmon and a seed from Norway - salmon, semga, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits in Europe can be offset by domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In the opinion of Mironov, the networking restaurants would be easier to rebuild than the primitive segment: it was unlikely that Gurmans would go there to distinguish Italian mozarella from Russian.
Although it's hard to have Ginza Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project has a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with its menus.
"The time will be replaced," says the Mirons.
In Ginza, the commentary was rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Coffee owners of the Caucasus and the Mid-Asian Cuisine stress that products from former Soviet Republics are more fragile than European
But there are many restaurants that the sanctions will not touch.
These include institutions from the CIS kitchen: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There is no expensive food in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatun Kolbaya, the owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and the "Way Mee!" cafe.
All raw materials are made for us in Russia, based on many dishes -- chicken phyle, we don't use exotic greens."
No food was removed from the menu at the Kolbai institutions yet.
Timura Lannski, the owner of the Chichon N1 restaurants with the Uzbek kitchen, is not embarrassed by the sanctions either: he's only going to have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
CIS can be cheaper to obtain cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
However, what comes from Middle Asia is far better than the “plastic” from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Uzbek tomatoes all know they're good, sweet.
Nobody says that about Spanish.
Following the sanctions, the representative of Minselvodhoz of Uzbekistan, Olymbo Articov, said that he planned to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by halving by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan have announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Restorants of the Fastfud who responded to the Deneg request are also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
The McDonald's Press Service stated that localization exceeded 85 per cent and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Department of Work with the suppliers of the Subway Russia, about 80 per cent of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and the increase in the price of meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In the Terrem, “sanction products” were not more than 4 per cent.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Wocker swings.
KFC, Burger King and Broshka Cardoska did not respond, but other market participants claim that Burger King's localization is significantly smaller than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, Restorators are ready to buy Chilen rather than Russian Far East
On his humpkin
In the meantime, the Restorators complain that the increase in demand increases price even on local products.
"The products for Grabley have increased by an average of 10 to 15 per cent, for the Italian Restaurant Cherri Mio, twice," says Restorant Roman Roznikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dish will rise by 5 to 10 percent, admits Colbaya.
The East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have traveled 10 to 15 per cent since the beginning of August."
"Brazil suppliers have raised pig prices almost twice, complaining to Sergei Rak, Deputy Director-General, Stardogs.
The chickens traveled 35%.
We're looking forward to China's prices, maybe they'll get hot Brazilian heads cold.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Rac.
According to statistics, the increase in total consumption in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to grow, he admits, but it is unclear as quickly as the majority of the Restorators have been stockpiled by food for the next two months, in the hope of waiting for the outflows of the purchase price.
But what's going to happen in two months is no one knows.
In the area ahead of Moscow’s mayor, there are dozens of utensils decorated with green and wood.
At the center of the scene, the musicians play a waltz.
It's a festival of regional products with a fun name "Eat Time."
"We've been going to do a holiday of local food for a long time, and here we've been sanctioned, we've hurried, we've organized a festival," one of the organizers says.
After the stage with the greek musicians, Anastas prepares a macaron salad and the home candy, there was a workshop to prepare a fight with caramelized apples on the day.
All Russian products, the organizers are assured.
In the tabras is an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian People's Farm.
Bacheri's honey, Salehard reindeer, Lenin's mosquito plant, cheese from the Italian cheese Jee Cloise.
"The rust for restaurants can be quietly replaced by another fish of salmon from the Far East," says Philip Halkin, the owner of the "Our People" fish.
We've got a scumbag, a keta, a coat, a humpkin, a chicken, a king salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he won't even move.
And our far-east salmon you can't hold back.
Institutions without special claims only agree to replace Italian mozarella domestic
His tent lies in shrimps with the Magadan burrow, cracks, olives, muxun, coppers from Krym, hammers from the Far East.
Halkin is sure that it's time to move to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, Russian fishing in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish is diverted to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Importing fish in 2013 is about 800,000 tons.
The Humans Lava has been working since 2012, selling fish through the internet store, before sanctions were imposed, served another and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Perfect Things."
Now 15 more restaurants have been applied to Halkin.
The same land can be made of our fish, it's hot.
We were frozen, we tried different recipes.
We're selling land on the Internet for a million roubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper a few times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
In support of the Galkin's tent, I'm getting a Philadelphia pot with a ket.
Unlike Rolls and Semgoi, they have to chew longer, but the consciousness that this fish is ours is a domestic fish.
There are even rolls from the piltus and the seafloor.
In the sushi bars, it's true that the Norwegian salmon is preferable to the Chilean salmon.
Halkin explains this by cooking lakes to invent new recipes with distant fish.
"Russian fish have not been offered to us yet," gives his explanation to the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Euseev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take on a liberation niche, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the Lavka Lavka Boris Akimov project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America are now more likely to be replaced.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and heavy volumes.
They are able to place banned imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is, the great producers of other countries will win from the ban," says Akimov.
On the other hand, the restaurant industry has also received a more alarming signal in the last month than food sanctions.
As a result of the massive out-of-planning reviews of Rosbusodor, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were suspended.
“We are examining the essence of the claims submitted to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated the “Denham” at the McDonald's press service.
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If all are limited to product sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says anonymously, a company member of a restaurant consulting company.
If they start closing McDonald's all over the country, the scenario will be different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the HYBDD certificate
Casco payments could be received without the HYBDD - so the CB intends to stimulate the introduction of Europrotocol in Russia.
The Russian Bank has developed a draft directive that, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to pay fees without the HIBD certificate.
It is true that only when an accident was arranged on Europrotocol without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved, no physically injured persons, no damage exceeded the prescribed limit and both drivers agreed on who was the perpetrator of the accident.
Since 2 August, the amount of Europrotokola is 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that often, even in minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be decorated by “europrotocol”, the drivers in the accident are responsible for DPS.
It was not possible if Casco polis was available to obtain compensation for him without the HIBDD certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft guidance are precisely intended to remove the impediment to the implementation of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum fossil fees for DATPs disposed of without HYBDD staff should not be lower than the Europrotocol limit.
However, it cannot be above the limit defined in the Casco insurance contract.
The idea is undoubtedly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DPA and the roads.
But she's probably not going to be fascinated by the motorists or the insurers.
The latter have already highlighted a serious threat to the increase in fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new Casco payments rules.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work to do to overcome the original Russian conservativeism.
The driver will in most cases wait for the inspector for hours to fix a small accident because it's more reliable.
And it's not clear that it's easier to win the cheats or convince the drivers of the "europrotocol" reliability.
The saving certificate will be named and irrevocable
Minfin wants to prohibit savings certificates for a producer, but will allow banks to make them an equivalent of an indispensable contribution.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates for the producer.
This tool has recently become popular because the rates are higher than the bank deposits.
The case is that the security certificates for the producer are not included in the investment insurance system, and the bank is cheaper because there is no need to pay to the Contributions Insurance Agency (ASA).
The practitioner is that this step is planned because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will suffer from Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASU estimates, control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The Bank of Moscow is estimated to be about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASU, is that the customers of the small bank that have purchased such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the ASU if they revok.
Some investors, lacking sufficient financial literacy and purchasing saving certificates for producers, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justifiable absence of insurance payments for these certificates in the event of a revocation of a licence from the bank may lead to a misunderstanding and social tension.
In the course of the Agency, there have been cases in which the holders of the certificates were trying to recover insurance compensation through the court”, stated in the ASA.
The problem, of course, is insane.
After all, no one will pay the buyers the certificates because they have no right to reparation from the State under the law.
If the tool had not been insured in the ASU, the metal accounts would also be banned with which citizens were counted in the grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platein and paladium.
These accounts are also not included in the investment insurance system, but they are not yet tempted.
The case is likely that the producer certificates are a very convenient securities, which can actually serve as a quasideneg.
In doing so, their movement is almost uncontrolled: any bank client can buy a certificate, hand a certificate to any citizen, and the certificate may be replaced by a number of owners before it is made known.
It is not accidentally stated in the Bill that the saving certificate must be a specific securities that must be kept in the depositary.
In order to satisfy the banks, such certificates are allowed to release without the right to pay before the end of the year.
That is, a similarity to the irrevocable contribution that bankers long dream of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nouport and Cardiff
The weekends were protested by those who opposed the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered at the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, some 150 people gathered at Cardiff's cathedral for what was described as anti-Sammit.
Stephen Ferklow followed us in the weekends and talked to protesters who had come from Brigenda to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank compounds to Iraq
Germany will place arms in Iraq to counter the Islamic State terrorist groups, informing ITAR Tass, on 31 August, of the decision taken following the meeting of the Government of the FRF, chaired by the Chancellor of Angela Mercel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable anti-tank missiles Milan and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 rifles G3 and G36.
The supplies will be delivered by the end of September.
It was also decided to allocate another €50 million to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Mrs. Merkel will make a Government statement in Bundestag on the subject.
Germany has not put its weapons in hot spots so far.
The views of the people of the FWG on the shipment of arms to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militias undertook a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsque militia undertook a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reported on 31 August by ITAR TASS.
It is reported that this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the settlements of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 kilometres east of Mariopol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two Coast Guards.
The incident is said to have taken place today some 16:20 ms.
Adolescents were taken on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO Bushuaker teenagers were taken on a helicopter to a safe place after they spent the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old went on a trip shortly after noon in Govettes Lip in Blackhit.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8: 00 p.m. when they didn't come home.
A search team was sent to include local police and rescue teams, and a couple found about 11 o'clock at Braidal Weil.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell down and bruised his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were raised on a lunch on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blu Mauntins hospital in a stable emergency car.
Two Unions Meetingd
Minsk summit negotiations did not solve the problems for which they had been convened, but created a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons in the future of the Eurasian
Let the concerns (the situation around Ukraine not tolerate delays), the EU leaders and the Customs Union, for the first time, discuss a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively, unclear; yet it is clear who removed the slips from this summit.
Questions fell back in the evening of 26 August, when the Belarusians and the other Eurasians and the Europeans saw them in the television news of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader set an example of identifiable respect, which was the behaviour of a man who had just teared Jeek-pot, and planned a decent age in a higher society.
How Medan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival of three major European commissioners (EU ministers) to Minsk, which met with Lukashenko and allowed him to take the final briefing on their behalf, was not merely the legitimation of the President for 20 years.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European policy and a major mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Dennis Melianzas, an analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, is confident that from now on Brussels will not be able to speak to Minsk as it used to.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met auntie with Lukashenko suggests that relations with the EU will continue to froze," he said, "The Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough of the Belarusian authorities began long before November, Maydan, in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“Whether the results have been achieved and from the EU are successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and the remediation process, the modernization dialogue - lists the “Fire” interviewer - and negotiations on international security have been held from the United States.
The States have even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, the leaders of Belarus themselves and their reactions to them were merely engulfed by this process.
On the one hand, Minsk was able to maintain a warm relationship with Ukraine, not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure refused to recognize the accession of Krym to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militia in Donbassa with all rigorousness, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left either the Customs Union or the CODB, and the Russian airbase is located in Baranović.
Brussels and Washington have noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian question - and appreciated it, confident Belarusian experts.
How successfully Lukashenko ' s political diversification would be, how often Minsk would soon be able to host EE+TS meetings.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected of relationships in a new format.
Spokesman Ashton Maya Kosiancić merely stated “Fire” that, while addressing the issues of war and peace, the topic was not a priority.
However, it was reported that Kazakhstan could be the next place of a meeting on the Ukrainian question with the participation of the first individuals in the new format.
A statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, President Narsultana, in which he confessed that he was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union to do so.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all the parties would not mind the fact that Minsk would remain a central meeting site for both Russia-OSCE-Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of Eurocommission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” has become a fully handicapped European leader that helps to solve the global problem.
Best Friend of European Farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, which included Eurocommunications on trade and energy, had already led to the conclusion that the main focus of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas transfers and the TC countries to overcome the concerns of the Ukrainian Association Agreement with the EU appears to be a larger achievement than the peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Güht, however, pointed out that the EU representatives “entered to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences and not the opposite”.
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine will work for Belarus.
Its consequences - especially the western and Russian mutual sanctions - are given to Minsk, who is still suffering the sanctioned pressure, the long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the leader of the Mizes Research Centre, ex-chandant to the Presidents of Belarus, Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the capacity of Belarus to deliver agricultural products to the RF in the commutation of sanctions.
There's a supply scheme for which Vladimir Putin at the summit scoured Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes, - stressed Romanchuk "Fire," - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have spent a long time in the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes have been destroyed.
Russian business needs to be rehabilitated, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, relates to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not care to set up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials as well as to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade schemes can now be very demanding.”
In the view of Romanchuk, the role of the master of the EU and TC negotiating area is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from Moscow sanctions were estimated to be Euro5-10 billion, and Euro5-10 billion was currently offered to the Agrarians only Euro 125 million.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on the euroferers.
This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU at an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the Summit initiative.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk of its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format opens up, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format had become Kiev.
“It was your proposal to gather, without the scourge, to discuss, not from the baracht bay, to decide, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that was then in Ukraine”, he addressed Peter Poroshenko to the Chambers.
On the other hand, the observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, and she was rumored against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases his political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is carefully stressed that Belarus, in organizing EU and TC interactions, does not pursue useful goals on its land, but the ultimate objective of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostock in the future.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, have put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic allies, the Russian Federation,” said “Fire fire” in the Belarusian Ministry, a department where the words have recently been scrupulously picked up.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry.
The Moscow Government considers the option of introducing paid entry zones as a method to combat the overload of central roads similar to other major cities in the world, transmits M24.ru with a reference to the Moscow swamp on the transport of Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully recommended is the payroll.
It's an expert opinion, we're going to study it, see all the gaps and benefits.
Saying that some decisions have been taken on this matter before it's too early," said Lixuts.
Zammera stressed that the capital authorities had a very important experience in Asian cities, which were structured and congested like Moscow.
One of the decisions taken by those countries was the construction of the central ring road already under way, and Lixutov added.
The recent construction of the Central ring road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to skip all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient travel infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zammara.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of fees had substantially unloaded the capital streets.
And he said that the capital authorities did not plan to stop at what they had achieved.
Recall that on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobian, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Highway (CICAD).
Badness is sinful.
Film Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez "The City of Sins-2: The woman for whom we should kill" did the wrong revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first “Government of Sin” (2005), dismissed with the minimum but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, made a revolution between films, comic books and literary nuares.
Sikvel is also a revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thinking chain of "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if it is understood by the nuar universe, and antithesis is space comics).
From now on, it should be read as "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
The City of Sin-2 is chaotic and dramatic, and philosophical: both times it's chaotic in a stupid sense.
Yes, part of the heroes are familiar with the first city, although, here, the Marve (Micky Rurk) burst out of life on an electrical chair, and there's nothing, but it's time to grab -- in the role of this people's wife -- from the air knives and other axes with whiskers.
But the old people literally screw newcomers into the city, as if they were flogging from some other movie, about the meaning and the story of which the audiences are asked not to worry.
So, my story, embarrassed by the authors in the most interesting place, is at Johnny's super-competent player (Josef Gordon-Levett).
It's for the Greedy Figid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, is not in his face to distinguish from Johnny, is that the faces, like other parts of the body, are deprived of the character's regularity, not a disaster or even a half victory.
It's not people, but we understand that these are Nura archetypes: a rocky bitch, too sure a player who's hung into a sex "med trap" detective, corrupted an ambulance senator.
Well, when the archetype is waltzing with the archetype and the archetype, it's no longer a movie, but it's an abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
Battle slums from the first “Gorode” continue to hold a circular defense against their family slums of darkness.
And the ghost of the Hartigan detective is not-no, and he's looking at the fiber, and Bruce Willis's always enjoyable to see.
The main problem of the City of Sin 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a painter, he talentedly joined comic books and Nuars, and as a director, turned the idea of how to put comic books on the screen.
Comic and Nuar are two aggressive "realities".
The modern comic book was born in the late 1920s, while the novels of Dashil Hammet "Bloody Harbour" (1929), the "Maltic Sokole" (1930) and the Glass Key (1931) created the Nuar canon, then called hard-boiled school, a "cloth school".
Or pulp fiction.
The comicces gave Hollywood many tens of heroes: from Popa's seafood, a spinate devour, giving him rich power, superman, Batman, and Dick Tracy to Halk, Tora, Spider Man and other "vengeance."
But in any movie for comics, there was something detrimental: painted characters did not want to grow up with the screen flesh, remained pretending in their surrounding will, a "real" world.
In simple words, they were totally deprived of "existence."
On the contrary, the most extreme genre of world literature.
After the world's wars, traditional novel, with experience, character, family scandals and historical backgrounds, has lost all persuasion.
What kind of Forks, which are Tibo and Rugon-Makkara, which even Bolkon and Rostovas are even thoughts after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated in the form of a soap opera, and the criminal, by definition, marginal, the novel rose to a level of philosophical prose.
Hammett in his skin found out what it was like to work as a sanitary on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the comparty and genre tables such as the writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors of Jul Dassen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitrick.
So the Nuar, whose archetype they gave, first, is rough and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "The City of Sin" was noticed exactly because it was unnatural, but it was organically connected with the Nuara comic.
For the first time on the screen, the comic was alive, not being embarrassed by his graphic nature, not pretending to be a real film.
The dream of a corrupt world where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the monstrous Sadist son, was well worthy of Hammet's pamph.
And the paintings of the kind of cutheads that the gardener decorated his nest, the genius James Elroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best, that is, a declaratively boring representative of the neonar.
The City of Sin-2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stiliticism - Roderigues before the comic tradition.
It's probably due to 3D technology.
When you look at the second "The City of Sin," you feel trapped in a glass ball, where snow falls into a toy clown.
But most often, it's not snow, it's bloody, but mostly what difference does it make?
Societality and nothing to say.
Because it's possible only when, somewhere, we've sometimes got on the side of the dirty mud, but there's a normal world where we can get back on the crooked path of a girl, or let's say to the discomforting parents that her disastrous one is punished.
But if there is no place in the city of sin except sin, then sin is no longer a norm, but a law.
It's boring like anything.
The chaos of the City of Sin-2 is just boring.
Justice for the sake of the domestic procrastination gave this fresh sin a little but glove.
Tits warn that the film contains harmful smoke scenes.
With regard to the sight, in the very vegetarian episode of which man is broken with his fingers, it gives him hell’s humor.
Hammett would like it.
France's socialists have to "knock and order France," says Frasoua Ollanda, key allies.
Mr. Valle called for the deep-separated left forces to “prove a warm attitude” to the attacked President of the Socialist whose restitutions were unapproved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, calling for applause.
As a sign of reconciliation, the Prime Minister had assured that his Government would not question the 35-hour working week in France, despite proposals that incited the conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel McRon, the new Minister of the Economy, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his socialist party companions to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Jusition, put the sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissented members of Parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing French to “lose faith in the future”.
Marine Le Pé, the leader of the extremely right National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not realize that the new Walle Government would last for a few months.
François Olland is a naked king, but the naked and prince Manuel Valle, who was forced to gather a new government when the summer was not lasting.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen reporter.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could win easily in pre-election elections and be ready to manage.
The French ruling party survived the riot in the March municipal elections, and the extremely right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up into several rival factions until the end of the Presidential term of Mr. Ollanda in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Xiannes Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government could not recover the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to be quick to feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
"The City Without Drugs" is without a search.
The Sverdlov Arbitration Court has left without consideration a claim for the directive of the Regional Ministry for the Administration of State of State to the Foundation for a City Without Drugs.
The statement intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as a rent of the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear before the court twice.
Today, the Arbitral Court of the Sverdlovs region has left without consideration a claim for the Executive Directive of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the region (ICWA) to the Foundation for a City Without Drugs (one of the founders, Mayor of Ekaterinburg, Eugenius Roysman).
Representatives of the provincial authorities intended to recover RU 7.3 million from the organization as a rent for the rent of the building.
It was now known that the plaintiff had not appeared twice before the court, which had led to a decision to dismiss the proceedings.
The absence of representatives in the ICTISO Directive was unable to explain, and the Chief of Legal Division, Maxim Titus, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to contact representatives.
Remember, this is a specialist who has held a fund at the centre of the city on Belinski Street, 19 on a gratis basis since 2011.
The decision was taken by the ex-hubernator Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Department of Public Property Management of the Sverdlov Province filed a claim to the Sverdlov Arbitration Court for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize an incommunicado free-user contract.
In the opinion of the IUGISO Directive, the agreement did not contain substantial conditions for the rent of a cultural heritage site.
The Court of Justice rejected the action, then appealed to the 17th Arbitration Court of Permi, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation complaint to the same court, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the High Court of Arbitration, but the court took aside the directive.
A new lease contract was concluded in 2013, where the fund began to pay rent again, and the head of the city of Evgeny Roysmann described it.
The rent was awarded for 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous Region Administration has handed this building to us for gratis use, recognizing our counter-narcotics merits, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The present administration has decided differently," he said.
Tatiana Drogueva, Ekaterinburg
Why mayor Yekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily.
On 24 July, a deputy of Ekaterinburg hordes, a monoross Alexander Kosinz, offered the mayor of the city, the Speaker of the Hill of Eugniya Roysmana, to resign.
The result was a criminal case against the arrested person on suspicion of the murder of a retired member of the Gulf Gulf of Oleg Kinev, who was considered a partner of the mayor.
How Eugenia Roysman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it was reported that a criminal case had been instituted on the “drive” (art. 128.1 of the Criminal Code) in the Blog of Mayor Yevgeniya Roysman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services in the Sverdlovsk region, where a statement was made by Anna Philatov, Director of the Legal Protection Centre.
According to her, Mr. Roysman accused her of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-wife in his blog records.
The Mayor of Katherinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to retaliate for the truth."
iPhone will turn into a wallet
On the eve of 9 September, when Apple is supposed to present its new developments, all the new leaks of what can be expected of the presentation appear in the press.
With reference to sources, American media reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of a joint Apple project and the payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code specialized Internet Re/code, the presentation of new products on 9 September Apple could, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which would make the new iPhone 6 smartphone available to the mobile purse function.
The company itself refuses any comments on this matter.
This function allows for payment on the shop's tape by means of a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be performed by the user on his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that iPhone will first have a NFC (near field communication) technology that allows for uncontact payment by means of a smartphone and an appropriate tape reader.
The NFC technology itself will be available through a special micro-processor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, the function of NFC was presented as part of the cooperation of companies Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for Advancing the Technology.
The first phone from NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with the function of NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet to allow users to tie their bank cards to their Google account and to pay off using the Android smartphone.
On the other hand, American experts stress that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, United States rhetors are still cautious about innovations and are not too willing to spend money on their stores' equipment by such systems.
So now the observers hope that the way Apple goes to this market will still make the Rielers speed up and more proactively introduce the technology in their trade points.
France: Paris ' s position on shipments to Russia ' s Mistralyi does not change.
The representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris had a consistent position regarding the supply of Russian helicopters like Mistral.
“I may recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Fransua Ollanda) in his interview of Le Monde of 20 August: “Today, the level of sanctions does not impede the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France,” quotes Mr. Nadal, "RIA Newsty."
The representative of the French Foreign Office responded to a question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris ' s position to implement the contract.
For more details on the shipment of helicopters to Russia, see Ogonek almost ours.
The National Security Council of Ukraine: seven military personnel have been killed for the past days in the force zone
The representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, Andrey Lisenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had been killed in the east of the hostilities during the past days, and another 25 had been injured.
The situation under Ilobase is extremely complicated.

Upon completion of the operation, data on losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of this situation will be held accountable,” added Mr. Lisenko, refusing to discuss in more detail the situation under Ilovask, where several Ukrainian battalions were brought into the community.
According to the representative of the CIS, “there is every effort to return the military who have been imprisoned”, reports ITAR TASS.
Mr. Lisenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had departed from the Lugansk airport towards the village of Georgiewka.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching $3 million with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, a third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the end of the negotiations to acquire a similar company of Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, reported by people familiar with the situation.
The transaction would provide Norwegian Cruise, market-value companies $6.8 billion, access to cruise vessels of the "lux" class and secured clients of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, reported by sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources requested that they remain unnamed because the negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 per cent over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands of Oceania and Regent, who together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It stated an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6 per cent higher than the previous year.
In the next years, the average growth in developing economies, such as China and India, is expected to be favourable for the cruise industry in $29 billion.
Companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in U.S. regulators for the primary public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million transaction in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000, as a result of merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a entertainment conglomerate and a casino controlled by a Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a share of 28 per cent, Apollo owned 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned an 8 per cent share in the company, according to the report at the end of June.

Hong Kong democratic movement activists stop speaking by the Chinese representative the following day after the election is decided
The group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress on Sunday established a procedure for only two or three candidates to participate in the elections of the leader of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the majority of members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of the Beijing Lialists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot paper and has made the democratic movement activists promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of China ' s control over Hong Kong in June, the democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business centre of the city and set up a seat strike.
Briefing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Bureau in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Assembly of Jang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Bureau of the State Council of Feng Vay were also required to address a series of briefings during the day.
Students of activists stated that they would gather at the Hong Kong Head's Building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to accede to 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they intended to accede to 400 hectares of land on the western side of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian autonomy.
The decision to accede to the land of South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to repay the abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers in June.
Israel's Minister of Defence announced the seizure of the Territory on Sunday and mandated the military to establish administration on the western bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saib Arikat, the world public must call upon Israel to account for “the continued settlement activity on the western side of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to commence negotiations on “Statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separated region.
His Spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin was not implying that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, the appeal of Putin to the Kiev Government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents, as equal, was in line with the obvious strategy to be followed from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help separatists to take the territory and to force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novosia factual independence to draw close to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the State First Television Canal, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return to the territory held by separatists in eastern Donetska and Luhanas, which was captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Krym on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territories of Novosia, or New Russia, the name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire's glory.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian policies began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops attacked peaceful settlements in the separatists' regions, “the monument of illusions”, reported ITAR TASS.
“We must immediately start meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political system of society and state status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peaks said that Putin's words on statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm the fears of Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can provide eastern regions with the necessary autonomy, said the Peaks.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peakov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but a domestic Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention by the Spokesman of the Kremlin to correct the “incorrect interpretation” of Putin's words underscored the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist rebellion in the east in another way than the open capture of the Krima, where the majority of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more severe battle in order to join even the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million people were not Russian, and the interviews prior to the outbreak of the conflict showed wide support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy discussed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give regional Governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policies themselves, in fact, by transferring the Kremlu to actual control of the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia to the Crime.
On the Black Sea peninsula, acceded five months ago, there is a major Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostow region and the Kram, mines, factories and plants are also located, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
President Peter Poroschenko of Ukraine proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the amendments to the constitution to give the regions with greater control over their finance and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armaments and incitements are accused of Moscow.
The last call by Putin to Kiev to agree with the leaders of separatists as equally followed the new insurgent attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the former peace area along the Azov Sea.
Russia ' s separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack, about which Ukrainian security officers say they are afraid that it is the beginning of the campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea itself.
This has resulted in extensive civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupoli, a steel port of 500,000 inhabitants, which is between the Novoazi Peninsula and the narrow passage to the Kram Peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko addressed the European Union Leaders ' Assembly in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent of 23 years.
"We're approaching the point of non-refoulement," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after the two colonies of Russian armoured personnel and 1,000 warriors entered the Donetsk region last week to support the hardships of separatists, Colonel Andrey Lisenko, Spokesperson for the National Security and Defence Council, reported to the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly held in Ilowaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian air assets captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago and reported to Lisenko on Sunday.
A scandal with naked photo captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust for hackers who might have stolen the naked photos of his bride Gabi Greco and the entire list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood, in resentment after a number of frank photographs depicting naked Jennifer Lawrence, entered the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible has about 60 frank photographs of the star "Holy Games" of Lawrence and superstars, including the models of Kate Appton and Kara Delevin, the singers of Rianne, Arian Grande and Lia Michelle and the actress of Kirsten Danst.
Australian actor Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonn Strahawski, who lives in Melbourne Greco, were also allegedly stolen by leakage from iCloud.
List 101 of the celebrities.
Edelsten, who offered Greco last month, said Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is horrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is reportedly in New York City, told the news website that the hacker attack was "disgusting" and that those to whom it was directed, "when they were invaded."
The hacker is expected to have 30 photographs of Palmer with former boyfriend Scott Spidman, including two frames, which are located at the naked basin.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsurt.
Palmer, the "Chuck" film and the actress from "Prohibition Reception" Browing yesterday didn't comment on the stolen photographs.
Representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "It's a gross private intrusion."
The acter Seth Rogen expressed his disdain for a hacker, who wrote in Twitter, "to put out photographs stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, nothing different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
Potential theft of photos of naked celebrities has been detected
The massive hacking of star accounts may be caused by vulnerability in the application Find My Phone.
The potential scenario of developments described the resource The Next Web.
The script in Python was published in Github's resource, which allowed for a search of passwords for the Find My Phone Service Apple company.
This service allows the location of iPhone to be monitored.
It uses the same log and Apple ID password to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photographs of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed a way of learning the password from Find My Phone.
The method has been consistently introduced with all possible symbol combinations, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script argued that in the Find My Phone service, the number of passwords entered was unlimited.
When the security system is properly organized, after several failed attempts to enter an incorrect account password, it must be blocked and reported to the user about an attempt to hack.
Because of vulnerability, the users have not received any reports of an attempt to bring the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp in Twitter, vulnerability was detected two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to pick passwords.
Vulnerability is now closed: access to the service is blocked after five attempts.
The resource was linked to the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerabilities were characterized by many services, but noted that there was no evidence that such vulnerability had been used to access the “star” account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again came up with foreign records.
Although there is no strong evidence that vulnerability in Find My Phone has been used for theft of photographs, there has been an earlier wave of harmful actions using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In the case of Apple, the media stated that the safety of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, too, the Twitter of Prime Minister RF Dmitria Medvedev had been hacked.
If the abusers had access to iCloud in the way described above, there could also be a password for the head of Government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web could not get Apple comments on vulnerability on Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian Five-Border
President Vladimir Putin of Russia granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete Anne Burak.
Relevant decree is published on the legal information portal.
At the beginning of this year, an athlete moved to Russia to a permanent residence place and requested the Federation of Modern Five Campaigns to provide her with an opportunity to advocate for the FM.
In 2013, she won two phases of the world's Cup, won the silver medal of the European championship in personal primacy and became a champion of peace in a mixed estaphet, one of the new kinds of sports programmes.
It also holds leadership positions during the current season.
In accordance with the rules for speaking at the Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, it will need to obtain special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Yakatine Lagno - crop Lviv, a two-fold European championship (2005, 2008), a world on the table (2010) and a fast chess (2014).
Among the Ukrainian women's team, the athlete became a winner of the Chess Olympics in Turin (2006), the Astana World Commander (2013) and the European Command Championship in Warsaw (2013).
The JCR discontinued the investigation into the Tu-204 disaster in Inukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (SCR) terminated the criminal case of the aerial crash of the Red Wings Airline.
This is reported by the Department's press service.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and aircraftman.
The Judicial Expert indicated that the catastrophe was caused by an increased speed of landing, non-compliance by the crew with standard procedures at landing, and unintentional exit of the engines for increased direct traffic.
The Red Wings Airplane aircraft, following the Prague-Moskwa flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 when landing at the Inukovo airport in Moscow.
The airship was blown out and fired.
The aircraft commander, the second pilot and the boatman were killed at the scene.
Two wardsmen were taken to hospital facilities, where the injuries subsequently died.
Three other side-wing patients who were hospitalized with serious bodily injuries were treated for long periods of time.
In addition, a driver who was driving at the time of the accident on the Kiev highway received serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board.
The Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, after the disaster, conducted a test at Red Wings, in which numerous violations were detected.
Aviation licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed its work in summer 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko began training in SIZO
The famous Russian militias of 33-year-old Alexander Emelianenko, who is in SIZO for sexual assault against a worker, recovered completely from injuries and began training.
This is reported by the Championship.
In May this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was declared in search on 9 May, he was detained in Tambov following an accident, which resulted in a fracture of the thigh.
An Emelianenko Junior was arrested until 31 August, and sentence was handed down on 1 September.
However, the court was postponed, and the investigation resulted in an extension of the detention period until 30 September.
If the athlete's fault is proven, he is in prison for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" remembers the most scandalous stories in Alexander Emelianenko's career.
Emelianenko spent his last meal in January of this year, losing the technical nightmare of a fellow countryman, Dmitry Sosuski.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous Fedorianenko fighter.
The latter is a four-fold world champion on mixed war arts, a four-fold champion of peace and a seven-fold Russian champion on a combat sambo.
Griev has proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of the human being
The heartfelt expression of the person is biologically universal to mankind, and every body and group of muscles involved does not happen but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, and has been identified by scientists from Australia and the United States.
They told them about their discoveries in the Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and we can briefly read about them in a press release at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The rage of the face is the shrinked and downward eyebrows pulled into the thin lip line, the rampant nostrils are the same in all cultures, and make it even blind children who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion had emerged for the effective handling of disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his or her condition, and he brings it to the interlocutor by means of anger.
Researchers have found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and become handcuffed, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavourable conditions on others, and prefer forceful methods to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Resulting from the fact that anger is primarily “the emotion of the bid”, scientists have decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles creating an angry expression of the person should be more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus make it possible to accept its conditions to avoid conflict as soon as possible.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer individuals who had arrived or were missing each of the seven elements of the angry person and showed them to the informants.
Although the omitted eyebrows or the front chin did not separately make the person angry, the more physically strong participants in the study admitted unanimously.
Man's anger, like that of animals, poses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own strength that compels him to accept and obey.
The man blows his nostrils and clamps his lips for the same purpose as the frog that is wearing, or the grandmother, who displays his balds.
“The fiery “commences” by the interlocutor ' s refusal to accept the situation, and the person shall take the form as efficiently as possible showing the opposite side the consequences of the refusal.
But the most amazing thing -- that none of the components of an angry person is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tuby.
Mincommissions have proposed 250 million roubles of Crom.
The Mincommissions proposed that 250 million roubles from the federal budget be allocated to the Autonomous Non-Commercial Telecommunication Krim in 2014.
This is described in the draft Government regulation prepared by the department that was familiar with “Lenta.ru”.
According to the Explanatory Note to the Project, grants from the federal budget will be “to cover the costs of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of the modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Krym, including the acquisition of equipment”.
In particular, it is envisaged that hardware, studio, video walls, central hardware and video servers be redesigned.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, from the funds allocated, the company will pay for the fibre-optic link (VOLS) and the maintenance of the energy system.
Subsidies will be provided within the federal budget for Mincommunications.
The Krim State Television Company was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Roman, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
To date, television coverage is more than 75 per cent of the peninsula.
In 2011, the Teleradio Company Krim received a digital television broadcasting license.
