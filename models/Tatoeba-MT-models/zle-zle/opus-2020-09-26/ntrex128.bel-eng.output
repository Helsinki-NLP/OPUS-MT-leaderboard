Welfare's extra deputies are worried about what looks like a moratorium.
Some deputies don't understand why their deputy status has to change to the status of the Wales Parliament.
The deputies have failed because of plans to change the name of the local East to the "Parliament Wales."
Deputates of all political beliefs believe that that's a deal.
One lieborist said his colleagues were worried that it was rhymeing with the words "foolish" and "fucky."
For readers outside of Wales: in a suite-language twp means "idiotic", and pwp means "fucky".
She said that her group was completely unsatisfied and offered alternatives.
The Valiana conservators said that their group was ready to discuss a change in the name of an assembly, but they noted that it was a short-speed transition from a member of the Valian Parliament to a “Marienette”.
In this context the Валyan letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire letter u.
The Assembly's Commission, which is currently drafting a draft law on change in title, made a statement, "The Continuous Decision on any description of what the deputies of congregation are called will, of course, be the question of the members themselves."
The Rural Law of Wales of 2017 gives the Valley East the right to change their own name.
In June, Camisi published the results of national consultations on the suggestions, which showed wide support for calling the Wales Parliament as the Wales Parliament.
As to the title of the extra deputy, the Chamber preferred the Wales Parliament or the FPU members, but the FMS version was the most supported during social consultations.
And other deputies, obviously, are offering alternatives, but the way to win a consensus can become a headache for the chairman, Eline Jones, who is supposed to present a bill of change for a few weeks.
The legality of reform will also include other changes in the association's work, such as the discognising rules for additional deputies and the changing structure of the committee.
And some other deputies will have final votes on the question of how to be called "When they're doing their legislative work."
Macedonians vote on a referendum on the change of country name
On a Sunday, voters are obsolete for changing the name of their country to or against “The Republic of North Macedonia”.
The national voting was organized to resolve a multi-year question with the neighbouring Greece, which has its own area called Macedonia.
In Athens, they long insisted that the name of their northern neighbour represents a claim on their territory, which prevented Macedonia from entering and friends in the EC and the Northern Atlantic Alliance.
President of Macedonia George Ivanov, a reporter on the change of title, said that he would not take part in a vote.
But the facilitators of the referendum, including Zorang Zone, claim that the change in name is a mere cost to pay for entry into the EC and the Northern Atlantic Alliance.
The calls of Saint Martin's Temple shut up; The bosses at Harlem are fighting for the existence of
"After as the old people I spoke to were saying, every corner there was a bar and a church," said Mr. Adams.
"The Son is not here nor the other."
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People have different intercourse and attitudes in the present time," he said.
"The Bars are no longer the comfortable local guests to go constantly."
As for the churches, he is anxious that the money from selling activated is not enough for such a long period as expected by the leader, and sooner or later they will come back where they started.
Churches,," he added, "can be replaced by house houses with candidatures filled with people who will not help the temples that will stay in the neighborhood.
"The most condominium buyers in these buildings will be white," he said, "and so it will accelerate the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the larger people who move into these condominums will become admired by these churches."
Both churches were constructed by a white community before Harlem became a black district -- the Church of the Constant solo in 1870, the Church of St. Martin -- in a decade later.
The original white medication site came from in the 1930s.
The black community, which was praying nearby, got ownership on the building.
The Church of Saint Martin was enthusiastic with the black world under the direction of Mid-Hopard John Johnson, who headed the baikot traders in the main Harlem Street trade in Harlem 125, where they refused to hire or promote blacksmiths.
The fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but the vertebrates under the oyce Johnson had planned a reconstruction, so they became operational.
Commendable David Johnson, the son of Bucket Johnson, and his successor in the Queen of St. Martin, who proudly called the carillon "the name of the poor."
The expert who played a carillon in a sticky pot called it a "Cultural treasure" and a "indispensable and historic tool".
An expert from the University of Michigan Ng also noted that this was the first in the world of a Crillian who had played black musician Dianisio A. Linda, who moved to a larger city in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merizer said that the Church of St. Martin hadn't replaced him.
What happened in the Queen of Saint Martin in the last few months was a difficult story between archaeologists and subscribers, some of which were engaged by invalid church leaders, others by the episode.
The horsemen's east is a governing body of coming, consisting of the capelan assistants, - written in a episode in a plastered obstination that the epoch "produces transfer expenses" to the east of the horsemen, although the assembly was not involved in the hiring of the architects and substrates sent by the Epharchy.
And some people complained about the absence of opacity from the epirchia.
Akula wounded a 13-year-old boy during a diving for a fork of lobsters in California.
On Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting for lobsters in California on the day of opening the lobster season.
It came about seven o'clock in the morning at Buckon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that morning Saturday engaged the Daiwin with his friends for half an hour, when he heard the boy shouting, asking help, and then swimming with the rest to help get him out of the water.
At first, Hemel thought it was a mere awkwardness from the fishing lobsters, but then he realized that something bad had happened, "I've bitten!
They bite me!"
"All his key was torn up," said Hemel, adding that noticed it when he came near the boy.
I called out to everyone to go out of the water, "In the waters near a shark!" added Hamel.
The old boy was transported air into Raidy's nursery in San Diego, where he was in a critical state.
The variety of sharks that have committed the attack is unknown.
Captain Lary Jails, fountain-guided by the media, said that the shark was noticed in this place a few weeks earlier, but was resolved that it was a secure variety.
Jails added that the affected injuries were received from the upper part of the towel.
The champions closed their approach to the beach from Pont Beach, Kasabladi to Saús Esynitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security sake.
Jails noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in this neighborhood, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to advance into the British Market of Beauty
Sainsbury's going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening offices with beauty in suburbs where practised specialists will work.
Within a significant promotion of British beauty around 2,000 billion pounds of sterling, which continues to grow, while the sales of fashion and household goods drops, more large houses of beauty will be presented in 11 salons across the country and in other salons next year that demonstrates success.
Investment in beauty comes because supermarkets are looking for a way of filling space in shelves that used to be used to television, micro-science stoves, and home goods.
Sainsbury's stated that would double the volume of beauty by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which would appear for the first time.
There is an assortment from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also will be given more place in a firm department like what you can find in such shops as Boots.
The large stores also restart their stick of Boutique cosmetics, so that most products will be fit for the vegans, and this train becomes increasingly demanded among the young purchasers.
Besides, the store of Fragrance Shop's perfume will test a conference in two shops of Sainsbury's, the first one opened last week in Croidon in south London, and the other will open up at Sali-Owk (Biming) at the end of this year.
Internet purchases and transition to buy small amounts of food every day in local shops around the house leads to do more effort to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, performing Sainsbury's director, said that the point of trade was going to be more like the umbrella because the supermarket network is trying to compete with Aldi's driven, Lidl using more services and non-hard goods.
Sainsbury's placed the trade points of Argos in hundreds of shops, as well as placed several dots of Habitats since two years ago had acquired both networks that, he said, contributed to the growth of the sale of food and made it more profitable.
Previously attempting supermarkets to reconstruct their own beauties and patches hasn't been successful.
Sainsbury's protested a joint Boots company in the early 2000s, but an attempt to separate the income from the optimal store ended after a number of trials in supermarkets.
A new strategy appeared after Sainsbury's sold his optimal business three years ago, along with 281 celesio owners of the Optical Network of Lloyds Pharmacy for 125 million pounds стерlings.
It was announced that the Lloyds had played a role in this respect by extending the luxury brands for caring for skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills Hicks, a commercial director of Sainsbury, said, "We changed the appearance of our beauty parlors to improve conditions for our customers.
We also invested in tutoring our staff who can offer our recommendations.
Our brands' assortment is designed to take care of any needs, and our attractive environment and our comfortable placement will make us the best home of beauty that stands against the old way of walking."
Peter Jones crashed after Holly Wilbie refused to make 11 million pounds стерlings of transactions.
Dragons Den Peter Jones star broke out after Holly Wilbie's television show turned down the 11 million pounds стерlings from his brand, specializing in the image of life to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Well, there's no time for Truly Brend of Goods at home and axeirs.
The business of the couple became like the brand of Guinea Peltrav Goop.
This morning a 37-year-old leader announced to Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Wilbie left the star of Dragon's Den Peter Jones, who is now breaking up with his profitable business to create brand-dress clothes to focus on his new Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts.
The sources report that Jones broke up when a golden TV girl was admitted during a strained meeting at Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow (Bakinghemshire) that her new transactions up to 1.5 million pounds стерlings meant that she would no longer have enough time to do household goods and accessors brand Truly.
The business was like a brand of Guinea Peltrav Goop and was doubled to double the well-being of Wilbie in 11 million pounds стерlings.
When Wilabi, aged 37, announced to Instagram that she leaves Truly, Jones flew from Great Britain and headed for one of her rest homes.
The source said: Truly was Holly's main priority.
This appeared to her a long-term future which she would see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to refuse had left all the participants absolutely shocked.
Nobody wanted to believe in what was happening in Tuesday and should have started dinner very soon.
In the headquarters of Marlow there's a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
The experts suggest that the care of the leader This Morning, who enters into a number of the most significant British stars, can cost the company millions because of huge investments in different goods--from pancakes and candles to clothes and household goods, and for possible further delays with their implementation.
And that could end long friendship.
Mother Rainbow and Dan Boldwin's husband were close to Jones and his wife, Tarai Capp for ten years.
Wilbie founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined the chairman's position in March.
I got a couple of rests, and Jones owns a 40-percent part in the Bulgarian television firm.
Willowby will be a representative of Brend M&S and replace Aunt McPartlin as leading ITV, "I'm famous."
The source last night, close to Jones, reported, "We won't comment his case."
A nice conversation after which we fell in love.
He fired on the criticisms which he received from mass-in-aware tools for his comments, who thought it was "non-president" for saying positively about the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump say a lot of wrong?
The trump said in his paradigm "dictary" voice.
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore had been announced by the Trump as a large step towards the denucleioization of the Northern Korea.
But the nucleus went off into a deadlock.
Three months after the fourth summit in Singapore leading the north Korean diplomat, Lee Hong Kong, declared the world leader at the General Assembly of the United States on Saturday that the European Union had never expected to respond to the previous steps of the Northern Korea in the area of separation.
Instead, he remarked, the US continues to use punitive measures aimed at sustaining pressure.
The tramped took a much more optimistic position in his speech.
"We build a very successful relationship with North Korea," he said.
“All might end up in war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We've got some good stacks now."
He said that his efforts to improve Kim's relationships had good results: the end of rocket trials, the help to liberate hostages and the remains of American soldiers back home.
And he was protecting his unusual conversational approach to Kim.
"Being on the president's side is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to penetrate that crowded land, we're going to have about 200 people there," said the Temp, pointing to the crowd right before it.
The Tsunami and the earthquake in India fell through the islands and hundreds of people died.
For example, after a earthquake to a foreign non-governmental organization, the lamb was told that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that over 10 percent of the population in Lambok have been displaced, there has been no declaration of national disaster, which is the necessary condition for international assistance.
"Alas, in many cases it was realized that they weren't applying for international assistance, so it was a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Save the Children's Recovery Foundation (Save the Children) and collects a team to travel to Palu until it understands whether foreigners can work in their places.
Mr. Sootope, a representative of the National Agency for Combating Schemical Disasters, said that Indonesian officials appraisal the situation in Pala to find out if international agencies were allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that have always been through Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for natural surprises.
While in the Acehwe have been built shelters, in the other shorelines their almost none.
The apparent flaw of sirens to be warned of the tsunami in Paul led to more sacrifices, though warnings were.
Even at the best times, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia was a challenge.
And the staggering troubles made it difficult for the logistics of moving.
The hospital vessel that was placed on in. a lamb for the treatment of sacrifice of earthquake, approaching Paul, but the way to a new place of distress would take no less than three days.
The president of Joco Eduda focused on his pre-election campaign on Indonesia's destroyed infrastructure and spent money on roads and railroads.
But the shortfall in financing is overwhelmed by Joc's administration, because next year there will be new elections.
So too, Mr. Joka faces pressure from the long-standing interfaith tension in Indonesia, where Muslim representatives accept more conservative Islam.
Over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were banished from their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting in the streets using stephetés, bows and shots and other cold weapons.

The Parliamentary Statue of Cromwell has become the last century's stroke in the "Recording History".
His removal would be a poetic justice for him, like the Taliban destruction of many cultural and religious artistic artifacts in England, done by his fanatic Puritan followers.
"But Cromwell's Torvacy described Mr. Creek's suggestion as "stry for stupidity" and "through rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, President of Goods Cromwell, said: In the present debate about the dismantling of the statues, it was inevitable that the monument of Oliver Cromwell near the Westminster palace would become the object of these actions.
The Indian Civil War Manoeuvre was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps bad Cromwell will be brought into sacrifice for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
A vivid presentation by Mr. William Ham Thornicroft about Cromwell is a testimony of the 19th century's thought and part of the history of an act which many believe we need now to respect.
Mr. Goldsmite said The Sunday Telegraph: "Then many know better from the end of the 19th century than today, as the defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Is that a completely exact representation, subject of a long and historical debate.
No question that the 17th century conflict formed the next development of our nation and Cromwell is an individually recognised figure that represents one side of it.
Its achievements as the Lord of the Protector, too, deserve to be commended and respected."
The pig-slayer lifted off to the death of a Chinese farmer.
As local media report indicates, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market southwest of China.
"The person who is known only by the bell--Juan, was discovered dead with an artery torn and crooked, besides the wedge on the Market of Lupanshui in the province of Guychzhov," reported the Sunday South China Post.
The pig was prepared to introduce a pig into a pig on May 30, 2005, in blue in the Chinese province of Tsinga.
He and his cousin came in Wednesday from the neighbouring province to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that the door of the neighbouring candle was opened.
He said that in the porpoise there was a great curtain with a blood on the piss.
According to the report, the forensic expert confirmed that a farmer's 550 kilogram burrow was lifted.
"My cousin's legs were covered and corrupt," said the cousin of the surname Woo (by the quote Guyang Evening News).
Video recording from a observation camera showed that Yuan had come to market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour.
The animal that killed a man did not belong to Jonah or his cousin.
The market manager informed Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on anyone else while the police were collecting evidence in the scene.
By messages, the Yuan family and the market administration lead the negotiations about compensation for his death.
While incidents when pigs fall on people are rare, yet they were before.
Yeah, in 2016, the pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, which resulted in serious injuries for a man.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 650 pounds rubbed a factory farmer down to his tractor and held it until his wife retreated the animal.
After a farmer from the state of Oregon had eaten his pigs in 2012, a manitoba farmer said to CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a dropping quilt.
"They're just playing.
They're biting and they're pretty curious... they don't want to harm anyone.
You just need to give them proper respect," he said.
The remainder of the Rose will bring strong rainfall to the southwest of the United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weaker because it moves over the colder seas of Mexico.
However, the next day, Rosa will bring floods in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
The Rose, Hurricane 1 category, stood at 85 miles/hour at 5 o'clock in the morning on the East Sunday, and it was recorded in 385 miles southwest of Punta Euschenia in Mexico.
"Roza," as expected, shake up at midnight of Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific is beginning to form a low-pressure area moving up to the east, to the western coast of the U.S., when Monday, Rosa, comes near the peninsula of the lower California, as a tropical storm, it begins to push the deep tropical rain to the north, to the southwest of the U.S.
On Monday, Rose will bring in some parts of Mexico up to 10 inches of precipitation.
Then, the tropical vulture that interacts with the nearby area of low pressure, in the nearest days, cries out strong springs in the southwest.
Places from 1 to 4 inches of precipitation call out dangerous floods, village streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep-tropical humidity will cause the precipitation to occur two- and three inches per hour, especially in suburbs of the south of Nevada and Orizon.
In some districts of the northwest, especially in most of Orizon, it's expected from 2 to 4 inches of precipitation.
Because of the partitioned rainfall, it is possible for a sudden flood to deteriorate rapidly.
It would be very undesirable to go to the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can lead the horses to turn into shuddering rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by a vulture of wind and dust.
The nearby area of low pressure will generate a high rainfall on the part of the coast of South California.
Possible dull precipitations more than half an inch can lead to a slight stream of garbage and make slippery roads.
It'll be the first rainy season.
Some dispersed rainfall will start approaching Orizon at the end of Sunday and at the beginning of a Monday, before the rain goes all over the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread over the Four corners around Tuesday and continue to Wednesday.
In October there may be strong temperature breaks in the U.S., as in the Arctic it becomes colder but tropics remain pretty warm.
Sometimes it leads to sharp changes in temperatures shortly.
There is a good example of a sharp break in the temperature in the central part of the United States in the Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Amahai, in Nebraska, St. Louis, and De-Moynam, Ayowa, the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
For the next few days the summer warmth will try to reinforce and widen again.
In many of the main and eastern states, the United States is expected to start warm October with 80 degree temperatures -- from the South plains to the North-East.
The temperature in New York can be 80 degrees Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate projection indicates a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern part of the United States until the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Bret Kavana hears.
Over 20 million people on six television networks were watching the interesting testimony of witnesses on Thursday in the Superior Court in the case between Bret Kavan and Cristina Blace Ford who accused him of sexual assault that was supposed to have happened in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political opposition continues, the broadcasters interrupted their regular programs to the benefit of the emergency news on Friday: the agreement developed by the FBI Orange Senator Jeff Flake: it was the one to conduct a week's investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senatian Court Bureau that she had 100 percent certain that the drunk Kavana grabbed her and tried to pull her clothes out of her at a party to high school.
The coffee in his bare witness said that by 100 percent, I'm confident it wasn't.
Perhaps over 20.4 million people, whom Nielsen reported on the Friday, looked at him.
The company calculated the average number of spectators on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available for other networks which showed it, including PBS, C-SAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually encounters problems with the scores of people looking at television in offices.
To compare: the size of the audience is the same as in the play-off game or the Oscar premium.
"The Fox News Canal, whose experts decidedly supported the appointment of Kavan, managed all networks, an average of 5.69 million spectators for the whole day," said the company Nielsen.
ABC took second place with 3.26 million spectacles.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, ” said Nielsen.
The interest remained high and after listening.
Flake was the main figure of the drama on Friday.
After the measurable Republic's concessions that he would vote in support of the Kavan, he was caught by the CNN and the CBS in Friday morning when the protesters shouted at him and when he tried to rise on the elbow for a hearing in the Court of Justice.
He stood with obsolete eyes within a few minutes when his swearing, and it was broadcast in straight air on the CNN channel.
"I'm standing right here before you," said one woman.
'Do you think he's speaking the truth to the country?'
He was told, "You have power, but many women have it."
Flake said that his office had published the application, and reported, before the elevator shut up, that he had still something to say on hearings in the waist.
All cables and broadcasting networks had a few hours' direct broadcasting when the Court Committee had to pause on the issue of Kavan's selection by the Senate Quorum.
But Flake said that he would do it only by realizing that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate for the next week, which would call for democracy in the minority.
Flake was partially convinced of conversations with his friend, the Senator-демократ Crism Kunes.
After a conversation with Kuns and some Flake Senators, they made a decision.
Fleika's choice was effective because it was obvious that there would be no vote in the Republic to confirm the Kavan without an investigation.
The President of the Trump has started a investigation of the charges against Kavans in the FBI.
Prime Minister of Great Britain Maya blames the critics for “Games in Politics” because of Brenxit
During the Sunday Times interview, Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of what she intends to leave the European Union that they play politics with the future of Britannica and undermine national interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Teresa May, arrived at the Conservative Party conference in British Burmingham on 29 September 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her in the first band of the newspaper there was her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, who spoke against her so-called Brexit's "shady" plan, claiming that the proposal for Great Britain and the EC to have the only tariffs was "together negligible."

Volcan excavates ash in Mexico City
The ashes that emerged from the Papacatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
The national centre for the prevention of static disasters on the Saturday suggested that Mexicans stay away from the volcano after they discovered activity and for 24 hours had registered 183 ashes and gas accidents.
The centre was audible to rumble and felt jolts.
Illustrations from social networks show that, in the vicinity of Mexico, like Sachimil, there's thin layers of popular covering on a car by a windshell.
Geophysics have observed an increase in volcano activity located in 45 miles (72 miles) from the south-eastern capital after the earthquake magnetus 7.1 in the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
A volcano known as Don-Goa has kept activity since 1994.
Coincidence of police with Catholic separatists on the eve of an anniversary of vote for independence
On Saturday in Barcelona there were six persons arrested after the adherents of independence encountered the police in public order, and thousands of others joined the demonstration in denouncing the first anniversary of the proprietary vote at the branch of Catalonia.
A group of separatists in visards that were slowed down by the police in public order and thrown away their eggs and powdered their paint by creating dark clouds of dust in streets that usually fill with tourists.
Later that day, the fight broke out when the police used their bastards to deter demonstrators.
For a few hours, a group of struggles for independence scandals, “Don't forget, don't forgive”, have encountered present professionals who shouted, "Living Spain".
According to local press reports, fourteen people have been treated with small injuries received in the course of protest shares.
The tension in the region that seeks independence remains high a year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid acknowledged illegal, but which was celebrated by Separatists Catalonians.
Choices tended to prefer independence, although the egg of voters was low, which was to a large extent explained by the dioxide of voices.
According to Catholic authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured after the police tried to stop voting on electoral stations all over the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
The groups in charge of independence spent the night on Friday to prevent the demonstrations supporting the national police of Spain.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters had to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, an electrician present at the separatist protest with his wife, said that he no longer expects to be Catholic independent.
"This is when we experienced one of the finest moments.
I saw my parents crying out of joy when they could vote, but now we are tired," he said.
Notwithstanding the vital but minor victory in regional elections in December of last year, the Catholic parties who advocate independence have tried to maintain this year's impulse with many of their most famous leaders and found themselves either in voluntarily exile or in prison, awaiting the trial for the organization of the referendum and the next independence notification.
A 42-year-old mechanic named Joan Puch, who writes down a protest to support the police on the phone, said that the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
"It's going to become more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junkeros, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in the SIZA since the end of last year, announced that they would participate in the elections in the European Parliament next year.
"The selection as a candidate for European elections is the best way to judge the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen from the Government of Spain," he said.
Londoners: men arrested after the house was powdered on the car
The three men at the age of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after their car repeatedly fell into the house in Londonders.
The incident took place at Belineard Crossint on Thursday, about 19:30 in British time.
Inspector-Detective Bob Blemings said it was damaged by the gates and by the building itself.
Perhaps at some point a bullet was released in a car.
As a result of the Manga Livingstan hit, it is winning over Raingers with a number 1:0.
The first bar of the Dolly Mangie into the favour of a "Livingstan" ensured them a victory
Livingstone's success was assassinated by the Raingers, and it was enough to assign Stephen George after he had several strikes in 18 games at the Ibrox manager's position.
The blower of Dolly Mangie was great, because Gary Holt got up on one level with the Hibernian in the second drive.
The Jerard team in this season doesn't win a ride in a premiere and meet the leader next Sunday, the "Harts" team, who stand back for eight points.
So far, Reingers, in the League of Europe, takes the Rapide's four vestige in Europe.
Livingstone, in the meantime, went on his best-purpose series in a design to six games, and the chief Holt coach was still feeling immediately after Kenny Miller's replacement last month.
Livingstone skips chances because of rude visitors
The Hall team must have been ahead of time before they have killed, but there are many challenges as they can.
Scott Robinson burst through, but lost his chance of killing at the gate, after which Alain Lythgo was able only to direct his efforts wider to meet the strike of Craig Halket.
Masters were pleased to let Raingers play in front of them, knowing they might trouble their guests at some point.
And this is how the main goal was achieved.
On the part of Raingers, a fine strike was allowed, and Livingstone was set out to debut, Declan Galacher and Robinson joined together to overcome Menгу, who made a pass and killed from the centre of the field.
So far, Redgers was dominating, but it turns out that the defence of the team is not good, and the poacher Liam Kelly has been practically unattended
And so it went on in the second half, even though Alfred Marelas had really rescued Kali.
The ball from Scot Pitman was kicked off by the Raingers Broadbird by Alan McGregaram, and Litgous was a long way off from the second Network of Livingstan.
The balls were constantly hit by a gate of Livingstone and were cut off, while the two demands of the toolbars had been rejected after the Halkette was called to replace the Glen Midlton, and the demand for punishment for the game was rejected.
"Fenoman" from "Livingstan" - analysis
BBC Scotland Allesdeir Lamantt on Arene Tony Macaroni
Feminal productivity and results for the Livingstan.
For men they were marvelous, stretching out overexpectations at this rising trail.
Their style of the game and the warehouse have not changed since they were returned to the highest escalon, but they should be commended for stimulating the team since he arrived.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkette was a grand builder of well-organized protection, while Manga was held by Conar Goldsson and Joe Warala everywhere in the field.
Raingers was inspiring.
How good they're in Jerard, they're not consistent with that standard.
At the last match the ball they did not possess, just once slew at the gate, which was something like a disturbing call for the Reinджерs, who ended up in the middle of the list.
Misc for Erdagon in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, you saw smiles and there were undue dreams when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at a breakfast in Berlin.

Erdagon was headed for in Cologne to open a new gigantic ball.
In this city, there is the largest population living outside Turkey.
The police took advantage of security orders not to allow the crowd at 25,000 people to meet in front of the ball, but there were a lot of followers coming up to see their President.
Hundreds protesting against Erdagon, many of whom were Kurds, also expressed their opinions, condemning both the politics of Erdagon, and the decision of the Government of Germany to greet him in the country.
Protests for and against display discords against the guests whom one of the German Turks has declared hero and others convicted as autocrat.

Rosa threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, with strong floods (which might be useful for drying regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rarely present in Orizon, but that's exactly what can happen at the beginning of the next week because there are traces of the rope Rosa in the southwest part of the desert representing the risk of sudden floods.
The national meteorological service is already on Monday, and Tuesday has published data on sudden floods in western Orizon, and in south-eastern Nevada, and south-eastern California, and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Tuesday, Rose, will go a straight path through Phoenix, approaching the rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix observed in Twitter that only “eight tropical cyclones brought a tropical storm or pressure falls within 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was hurricanes in 40 miles from the Arison border.”
The last model of the National Hungarian Centre projections decaying between 2 and 4 inches, whereby the level can reach 6 inches in the Magalion district in Orizon, individually.
In other districts of the southwest desert, including mainland mountains and the Great Basin, it's probably going to fall from 1 to 2 inches, and then individual results can reach 4 inches.
For those outside the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rosa could be long-awaited because their region is suffering from drought.
While the flood is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be useful, as droughts are now observed in the southwest.
According to the U.S. drought monitoring agencies, at least a little over 40 percent of Orizon's territory is under another category of emergency drought,” says weather.com.
First, the road to Hurricane Rosa leads to a crowd in Mexico's southern California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had a strong hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles an hour in 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and moving north with a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm will face with more cold waters in the Pacific and therefore shrink.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico at the coming of a tropical storm, there will be a way out of the river from the shores by day or evening in Monday.
Pestilences in different parts of Mexico can be strong enough to create a great risk of overthrowing.
"The total number of precipitations occurs from 3 to 6 inches in between the bottom of California and the northwest of Sanlara, where possible precipitation is to 10 inches," reports weather.com.
Then, the Rush will move north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arison border early in the morning in the form of a tropical attack of pressure, which then will prolong the movement across Orizon and the southern part of the state of Utah to the evening of Tuesday.
"The real danger is expected from "Rozy" or its remnants, it is very strong rains in southern California and northwest of Sanora and Southwest U.S. desert," reported the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will lead to dangerous for life and sudden floods and village streams and nails in the mountainous region.
State of Midsamer Norton: four attempts to arrest murderers.
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested suspected of attempting to kill after finding a 16-year-old body with a lot of violent wounds in Samarsette.
Three teenagers were found wounded in the Terrace Exelsier in Midsomer Norton about 4 hours a Saturday.
He was delivered to the hospital, where he remained in a "stable" condition.
"The 17-year-old boy and both others, 18, and 20, were arrested at night in Radstock, Evon and Samerset," the police told.
The police addressed anyone who had any evidence on his cell phone of what had happened to move on in their search.
"The kavanamon stands out of the folly and the anger of the Democratic Party," said the Trump.
"The head for Judge Kavano is a voice for the abolition of an avid and indignant Democratic Party tactic," said the Trump at the Willing, East Virginia.
The trump stated that the Kavano was "built from filth and anger" of the Democratic Party in the course of its selection to post.
The coffin gave an indication before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying the charges of Cristina Blace Ford that he had sexually raped her for decades while they were teenagers.
Ford also gave an indication during the hearing of her charges.
On Saturday President stated that “This day the Americans saw a brilliant, quality and courageous character."
"The voice in support of Judge Kavano is a voice for one of the most perfect experts in the field of the law of our time, a legalist with a wonderful history of the State Service," he said to the crowd of followers of the West Virginia.
The President had indirectly referred to the selection of the Kavano, speaking about the importance of the eggs in the Republic of the Republic during the intervening elections.
"Five weeks is left to one of the most main elections in our time.
I'm not just late, but really late," he answered.
"That's why I always struggle for big candidates."
The tragedy is inconsistent that democracy intends to "continue and disturb."
"It may be that the first key processing vote on the Senatian level on Kavano's election will take place no later than Friday," said the CNN leader of Parliament.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of a earthquake and a tsunami in Indonesia, the number of affected by is growing.
"At least 384 people have died, many have disappeared as a result of the influx of gigantic waves on the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian Isle of Sulaves," declared the Saturday power.
Hundreds of people assembled on a festival to the beaches in Pala in Friday, when the waves six meters high (18 feet) beat about the shore in twilight, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
Following the earthquake magnetise 7.5 happened to tsunami.
"When the tsunami threatened yesterday, people were still on the beaches and were not immediately running away and they were victims," said the British in Jacart press secretary of the Indonesian Agency for Eliminating the Soutopo Pourvo Nugrojo Disasters.
"The tsunami pulled cars, beards, houses, hitting all about the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunamis had gone through the open sea at 800 km/h (to 497 miles/h) before they hit the shoreline.
He said that some people survived just because they climbed down the trees to get away from the tsunami.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated in the 24th center of Palu.
The aerophotographs published by the Smoking Agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed and bridges rotated and collapsed and the ball was surrounded by water.
The following jolts continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series resulted in 2.4 million populations.
India's Technology Assessment and Use Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy produced as a result of a strong earthquake in Friday is about 200 times more than the atomic bomb dumped into Hiroshima at World War II.
According to his data, the geography of the city, which is near the end of the long narrow covet, could increase the size of the tsunami.
The Nugroha called the damage of the “wiger” and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, trade centres and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some sacrifice were found under hacks of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured, and 29 were missing without news.
"A casualties and regrettables can be greater than 300 kilometres [300 km] along the coastline, north of Pala, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epiccentr of the earthquake," said Nugroha.
Dungal's connection was "perfectly damaged," told Nugroha.
"There are over 300,000 people," says Red Cross, adding that his staff and volunteers have been sent to affected districts.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, agencies were widely exposed to the fact that they didn't report the Tsunamis in Paulo, but the officials stated that the waves came while the warning was made.
In social media images you can hear a man on the top floor of a building crying out people on a street warning about the coming tsunami.
In a few minutes the water wall fell on the shore, stretching behind the buildings and cars.
Reuters could not at once verify the authenticity of the withdrawn material.
Earthquake and tsunami were caused by a serious disconnection of electricity that disrupted communication around Paul, so it was difficult for governments to recall the savings.
According to the authorities, the soldiers started flying truck planes using Jakarta and other towns, but evacuated still needed food and other essential things.
The city's airport was opened only for assistance and would be shut up to October.
On Sunday, President Jocque Vida was planning to visit the evacuation centres in Pala.
As a result of the tsunamis in Indonesia lost more than 800 people
That is very bad.
"At the time when World Vision staff from Dangala were successfully travelling to Paul City, where workers hid in unison burials installed in their yards of office, on the road they saw the scenes of desolation," said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of broken houses," he said.
That is very bad.
Even when relief teams started grim action on launching disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge prevented them from going to Pala.
According to Indonesian rules, finance, suppliers and personnel from abroad can only start to do so when a disaster is announced by the national disaster zone.
That didn't happen yet.
"It is still a disaster at the province level," said Aulia Arriani, secretary of the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national catastrophe," we can open up for international help, but this status is not yet available.
The other night in Pala, after earthquake and tsunamis on Friday, friends and family disappeared without springs hoped that their close wonders would be among those which would leave the joyless most urgent lines of staggering disasters.
On Saturday a little boy was released from the sewage.
In a Sunday the servitudes released a woman, who was under ruins for two days, and beside her was the body of her child.
Hendon Subandona, a coacher of the Indonesian National Paraporism Team, prepared two of the disappearing paraplanes for the Asian games that were completed early this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others, who were trapped in a Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
"Being an older person in the field of paraplaneterism, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Hendon told me about a few hours after the community of paraplaners spread news about the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, he desperately sent messages to whatsApp to the Palu community, who were at the beach festival.
His messages were nevertheless marked by a single grey head, not two blue.
"That means the messages have not been delivered," he said.

"The morning of the thief was stolen at $26,750 by a British employee who was putting bills in a jarmat in Newport on Libya," said the Newport Police Department press.
"The car was ruined by a bunch of bunches in the entertainment complex and prepared for more money," wrote Danis McCarthy in the release.

AMLO in Mexico promises not to use army against peaceful residents
Choice of Mexico's President Andrez Manuel López Abrador has never used military power against civilians since the country's 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, at the area of Tlatelolco Plaza López Abrador paabyans, “never use militarymen to fall upon the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration on the ground, which resulted in the death of about 300 people, while the leftst Studio movements were rooted in Latin America.
López Abbrador poabies support young Mexicans by publishing monthly subsidies to those who learn, opening up more free places in public universities.
"The work and lack of educational capabilities attract youth to criminal groups," he said.
US should double finance by machine intelligence
"In order to become more active in machine intelligence, the United States has to double the amount they spend on research in this area," says an investor and a Kai-Fu Lee engineer who worked on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments emerged after different parts of the US government made statements about MI, even if the United States lacked a formal MA strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan, by 2030, it was committed to being the first one in the field of innovation in the MI.
"The diversion of the budget for research in the MI area would be a good start, considering that all other countries are standing away from the United States, and we are expecting the next break in the area of MI," said Lee.
"Twice financing can double the probability that the next big achievement of MI will be in the U.S.," said Lee to the CNBC in the interview this week.
Lee, whose book, Superior Powers of Machine Intellect: China, the Sylicon Valley, and the New World Order, was published in this month, Howton Mufflin Harcurt, is the principal performing director of the Simonation Ventures company, who invested in one of the most famous MI campaigns in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie-Mellen University, he worked on the machine intelligence system that beat the highest American player in Atell, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the President of the Google Chinese office in China.
Did the pre-governmental technological competition of the United States, like robot technology competition of the Agency for the forward research project in the field of protection, and asked if it would happen next, to help identify the following translators.
"The U.S. researcher often has a lot to do to get public grants," said Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders; it's corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have recently been reaping lights from the Universitys for II work.
Lee said that immigration policy change can also help the United States reinforce its efforts in the area of machine intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically be offered candidates in the field of MI," he said.
The Soviet of China, in 2009, released a plan for developing machine intelligence for the next generation, in line for 2017.
"The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for people in educational institutions like the National Science Fund and other state organizations spend money for U.S. researchers but the quality of academic work in China below," said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Defense Ministry created the United Machine Intellect Center, where partners in industry and science were supposed to participate, and the White House announced the establishment of the Machine Intellectual Special Communities.
And this month, an Agencies tasked with a forward-looking project in the field of protection announced an investment of $2 billion in investments called AI Next.
With regard to the National Science Organization (NSF), she now invests in the study of the II of over $100 million a year.
Meanwhile, the US legitimacy which tried to create the National Machine Intellect Safety Commission had not seen action for a few months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum on the change of country name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on to change their name to "The Republic of North Macedonia" to allow for a solution to the ten-year dispute with Greece, which blocked the applications for participation in the European Union and NATA.
The Greeks whose province is Macedonia argues that the name of her northern neighbour is a claim on her territory, and put a veta in the entry into the NATO and the EC.
In June, both governments made a deal taking into account the proposed new title, but nationalists say that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he wouldn't vote for a referendum and that a combat campaign questioned whether the voter tree would follow the minimum of 50 percent required for a referendum.
The question of voting at a referendum suggests, "You are members of NATA and EC with acceptance of the Greek agreement."
The followers of the change in the name, including Prime Minister Zorang Zone, claim that it's the cost of paying for acceptance to organs like the EC and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the aftermath of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the estates of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us," said Oliver Georgiew, 79, Skop.
Although this is not necessarily legal, a sufficient number of parliamentarians stated that they would take into account the results of voting to make it decisive.
Change name requires more than two thirds of the parliament.
The civil court said that the disturbance was not received by the one-hour day.
However, it had only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered voters were white.
"I came to vote for my children's sake, our place is in Europe," stated the 62-year-old voter in Skopje Joseph Tanewsky, capital.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaw, his wife, Zoritz, and his son, Dушка, voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to a change in the name of the country that will open the way for her entry into the NATO and the European Union, in the Straumic, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Before the Skop parliamentary building, Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, was preparing a small scene and laying chairs in front of the tents installed by those who would beat the referendum.
"We're for NATA and the EU, but we want to merge with our heads up instead of the office door," said Kavadarks.
"We are a poor country, but we have an honour.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can look to others, like China and Russia, and become a part of the European integration."
The Prime Minister said that NATO friends would make the necessary investments in Macedonia, where the unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
"I believe the majority of our citizens will be for, 'because more than 80 percent of our citizens support EC and NATA," said he after the vote.
He said that the result is that the result is “the reconfirmation of our future”.
In a survey published in past Monday by the Institute of Political Studies in Macedonia, it is said that a referendum will participate from 30 to 43 percent of the voters whose voters are below the required beetle.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telescope showed 57 percent of the people interviewed who planned to vote on a Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said that they were "Yes".
For a successful referendum, beetle has to be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum will be the first serious attack on the policy of the pro-Asian government since he came in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguera, with Manchester City passing to Gate through the entire Breiton protection
On Saturday, Sergia Aguer and Rahim Sterling solved a problem with the protection of Brytan by the Manchester City winner, number 2:0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
And for the 65th minute, it was easy for Aguer to do it.
Argentine attacked got pitched down in the middle of the field.
He was leaning between the three defenders of Breitan before he struck at the open field.
Then Aguer found himself among the four green shirt.
He walked round one defender and pipped still a few at the edge of the Britannica Field.
Then he pushed a grip on the left flank, finding Sterling.
English raided the first hand in a fined handed Aguer's ball, who used his right stroke to circumvent Matthew Ryan's gateway to the right side of the network.
"Aguera has some problems with his feet," said the journalist head of Pep Guardiola.
"We talked about how he was playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We've been lucky that he's killed his bare at the very moment."
But it was Serling who gave Sky Bluz the initial advantage in fighting in Premier Lie.
This bare happened at 29 minutes.
Aguer has got this ball in the bottom of the Breitan area.
He sent a handsome ball through a left flang toward Lerua Sane.
Seine had made a few touches before Sterling could reach the distant trousers.
Putting the "Block of Bluzz" headed the ball on to the grid before it pops out overseas.

Hex wants to play the "Settings" role against Rocky
After the Nationals were shut off from play-off competition, there was no particular reason to pause a new start.
But steadily competitoral Scherzer hopes to take a stab on a Sunday against 'Calored Rocky', but only when the consequences of the play-off are still there for Rocky, who remain in the leaders after one game of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northern West.
Rocky has conquered, at least, a unique place with a number of 5-2 over the Nationals on Friday evening, but they still hope to get their first title on the television.
"Of course, even though we're playing this at least, we can cope with the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver and with the crowds and with the other team will be made up so that the game is probably going to be the highest level of all I've encountered this year.
Why don't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced a start for a Sunday, but, as reported, they are inclined to give Sharks a ball in such a situation.

The Temple speaks in Western Virginia
The President indirectly referred to a situation around his choice of the Bret Caváno Superior Court, speaking about the importance of a Republican egg in the interim elections.
"All we have done is under the threat of November.
Five weeks from one of the most main elections in our life.
This is one of the big, big--I'm not late, but really late, that's why I'm everywhere fighting for large candidates," he said.
The tract continued, "You see this terrible, monstrous, radical group of democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to turn their power back, using any necessary means, you see,--rockliness, delusion.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, whom they have to beat, to get power and control, it's what they want, that's the power and control that we're not going to hand over."
He said that democracy intends to "oppose and disturb."
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wicked, vile, otherwise and lying."
He went to the Senate Court Committee and continued to recognize the Democratic Group Dianne Feinstein Senator, who got a loud score from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you have the document run?
Uh, what.
No, I don't expect it to be a very bad unbelievable language. It's the worst language I've ever seen."

That is inferiority to those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party were paused for injuring me, it was unlikely to be surprise.
After all, I'm the last in number of parliamentary members from a lab party who are told that we're not welcome--everything to say our opinions.
My colleagues at Parliament, Joan Ryan, received an analogy of feedback because she was determined to resist anti-Semitism.
In my case, my censorship was revealing me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
About the importance of responsible economic politics, of national security, of Europe, of the irony of fate, of such matters as Jeremy disagreed with the previous leaders.
On a meeting that was validated on Friday by the Notingham East Laborist Party, it says, "we want these meetings to be latched and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local member of Parliament from a laborist party that is exactly such a meeting were on Friday
Unfortunately, today in most meetings the tone isn't such and the promise of a 'gooder, more soft' policy has long been forgotten if ever been.
It becomes more obvious that, in a lab party, different views are not allowed, and every opinion is judged by that side, it's normal for a party guide or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, because the colleagues I'd earlier believed that I was sharing the same political views were beginning to expect me to take a step back and take the position that I would never agree with - on national security issues or on the single EU market.
Every time I speak public -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- a opposing social network is being opted for an abolition, condemning the policy of the centre, saying I'm no longer in the Leuborist Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Actually, I know that I'm lucky to have more than some of my colleagues because the comments sent to me are usually political.
I'm excited by the professionalism and the determination of those colleagues, who face every day the stream of sexual or racist events, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is normalization of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Laborist Party should develop a culture of talent.
Reality is that we're no longer an organization that takes a different view and with every movement of uncertainty or changing selection rules the party becomes more narrow.
For the last two years I have been given a lot of advice, which have called upon me not to fall in spirits; be not so loud; and then with me all will be right.
But that's not what I had to do with politics.
Since I was joining Leiborist for 32 years ago as a school student provoked by the Tatcher Government's rejection, since my schoolteacher was falling through, I tried to stand down the best public services for those who would most need it, whether it was the local resident or the government minister.
I never hid my own political opinions, including past elections.
No one in East Notingham could be entangled in my political position and the sculptures of disagreement with the present direction.
For those struggling for this movement on Friday I should like to say that, if the country is going to go to the Brexit, which is detrimental to the household, to enterprises and to our public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and strength on my loyalty to the Lider of the Liborist Party.
But in fact the only message I have is--this not the Nottingham Momentum, it is my voters, whether it will be the members of the labsters, or not: I am proud of what I am serving you, and promise that no threat of cancelling the elections will be or political purpose will not prevent me from acting in the interests of all you.
Chris Leslie is the deputy of the Notingham East Party
Iir-Melrovs 38-17: Invincible Ir on the top
Two late attempts might have somehow told the final outcome, but he no doubt deserved a triumph in this strangely interesting Premier-Leges of Tennant.
Now they're starting the tournament table, one side of ten.
After all, it was their supreme protection, just as their best chances, which had made their masters, coach Peter The Mercury had the full right to be satisfied.
"We've still tried our games still, and we're still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
The robin Crystal from Melroves said, "Give Eura the proper; he ventured more than we do.
Grante Anderson's 14-minute attempt, transformed by Fraser Klima, put Ira in front of the plan, but the yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained by Warriors, allowed Melrousa to sung in numbers, and Jason Baggot snuck in for an unreasonable attempt.
The climes stretched the leadership of Eira through the toolbar before, right at a break, he killed and then took a solitary attempt by making 17-5 Air at a break.
But Melroves well started the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, transformed by Bogot, reduced his revolt to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious traffic of Ruarid Not, which was stretched out, and afterwards, Eir moved further after Staford McDauel's attempt at the Climes implemented.
Eir, as he performed the duties of Captain Blair McFerson, got a yellow card, and again Melroves forced another man to pay using an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colwin at the end of February pressure.
But the landlords returned, and when Strauan Hatchinson got his yellow card for sabotaging the Climas without a ball off the fine line, McFerson landed behind Eira.
The climes implemented their attempt that had done again almost after starting off, after Kyle Rove had got David Armstrong hit in a fine and sent Gregor's Henry's flanker for a fifth attempt at the masters of the field.
Star Still Game seems ready to a new career in a restaurant business
However, the Ford Kieran game star is going to go into the hotel business industry after it was found out that it was intended to be a director of a licensing restaurant company.
A 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the popular BBC show he writes and films with Greg Hemphil's long-standing colleague.
The dove announced that the next nine series of series would be the last one in a series of show and that Kernan seemed to plan to do next after Kraiging.
According to the official records, he is Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kernan hoped to participate in the “blossom trade in Glasgow”.
“Mor ours: ” Bolivia, which has no way to the sea, hopes that the court will again open the way to the Pacific
The sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Citizens' buildings under the blue flag.
In the naval bases from the lake of Titicka to the Amazon, the moor of Our Right.
To be sure, it's our duty.
In all the Bolivia, which has no way to sea, the memory of the shoreline, lost by Chile in a bloody conflict from the resources of the 19th century, is still alive--like the desire to swim again across the Pacific.
These hopes may have reached the maximum top of the past decade, as Bolivia awaits the judgment of the international court on 1 October after five years' discussion.
"The Bolivia has a impulse, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it is waiting for the positive result," said the Balbias diplamat Robert Calsadilla.
A lot of ballisticians will observe the decision of the MC on large screens across the country, hoping that the dock in The Hague after decades of strenuous trades will support Bolivia's claim that Chile is obliged to negotiate a consignment of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Eva Morales is a charistic president of Bolivia, who is confronted with a conflicting struggle for re-election next year.
"We're very close to going back to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and that little will change, even if he does.
An organization based in the Netherlands has no right to decide on Chile's territory and stated that it would not determine the origin of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice goes out only six months after the final arguments were taken into consideration indicates that the matter was “not complex”, stated the Chilean expert in the field of international law, Paz Zarate.
And far from pushing the affairs of Bolivia, perhaps the last four years had abandoned it.
“The problem of access to the sea was monopolized by the current Balow administration,” said Sarat.
As she said, the warrior Marales lost the remnants of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to speak, but afterwards it will be very difficult.
Since 1962, two countries have not exchanged their parlams.
There was President Edward Radrigues Velte, a representative of the Bolivian people in The Hague, who rejected the idea that the decision-making of the court was unusually prompt.
The Monday will bring Bolivia's “the ultimate opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of“letting an end to 139 years of discrepancies with mutual fiction”, he said.
Calsadilla also denied that Marales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the marine problem as a political aperture.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific," he added.
"The moment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past."
North Korea declares that nuclear separation will not come till they can trust the US
The Foreign Minister of North Korea's Rie Young Ho says that his country will never stop using his nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
The Ri spoke on Saturday at the General Assembly of the UN.
He called on the United States to carry out the promises reached during the summit in Singapore between the leader.
His comments come like the United States. Mike Pampéa's divergent seems to be at the boundary of re-establishing nuclear impasse with the North Korean Kim Chen Yin more than three months after Singapore
It's said that it's a “nourishing dream” of prolonged sanctions and objection to the U.S. declaration of the end of the war in Korea that has ever been put in her knees.
Washington is afraid to agree with the Declaration- -when Phenyang won't take a significant step toward disarmament at the beginning.
And Kim, and the President of the United States, Donald Trump, they require a second summit.
But there's a great skepticism about Phenyang being seriously treated as a denial of arsenal, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pampea is going to visit Phongyang in the next month to prepare for the second Kim Tramp Summit.
On the Parisian fashionary tests we saw a very new line in a massive head-room on the road to the shops in your cities
If you want to zoom in your hat collection or completely close the sun, you can no longer look for it.
The designers of Valentino and Thom Browne presented on a wheeze of many unusual heads' cleanings for their collection of SS19, which crossed the wait from Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was overwhelmed by the popularity of improper hats, whose designers sent their creations to a pillow.
The distinct feature of Valentino was a luxurious crepe hat, ornamented with wide margins, like feathers, filled with head-made models.
Other acessurinames uncommonly large included trimmed coffee- stones, a magician's hat, and even a pineapple, but they did not mark a to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed a collection of bizarre masks--just before Halloween.
Many of the multicolored masks were with their ears and more reminisced by Ghanibal Lecter than by a high fashion.
One of them was like a market for submarine swimming with tube and protective sharks, and the other is like a seafood spilled cone.
And if you continue to adhere strongly to the enormous attributes of fashion, you are lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can burst into our daily life.
The hat of a huge size goes on its heels to the “La Bomba,” a salami hat with a two- foot-long width that can be seen by everyone, from Riyana to Emily Rataikovsky.
The Kult Mail on a very uncomfortable hat which was spread out in social networks has contributed to another large creature on a pillow -- a salmon beach bag, almost as big as a model with this bag dressed in a bather.
The Dark-arangled bag of a raffe, enclosed with a raffe and covered with a white leather handle, became an extraordinary part in the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 on the weekly fashion of Paris.
"I'm expecting a big hat and beach bag in the main streets next summer, because the designer has had a great impact, and it would be hard to ignore demanding for negative axes."
Knowledge Language is the necessary skills for all citizens of the world
The independent schools in Scotland have kept achievements in academic success since 2018, with another remarkable outcome of the exams that are reinforced by individual and collective success in the debate, arts, music, and other initiating communities.
Over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, schools representing the Scotland Independent School Council (SCIS) are trying to provide a better level of work for their students and their parents.
Independent schools are trying to prepare their students for the ongoing higher education, chosen by their career, and their place as a citizen of the world.
As the educational sector that can develop and provide an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
He said, "When you talk to a man in the language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you talk to him in his native language it goes to his heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't only rely on English in English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
With the last exams this year, we see that languages take the first places in a list of leagues with the highest rate of fibres in independent schools.
In a total, 68 percent of the students studying foreign languages received the highest score of grade A.
Data collected in 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of the students achieved higher grade A in Chinese education, while 72 percent were students in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future.
Now language as a subject is chosen just as STEM subjects are -- in science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- in educational programs for independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey carried out by the Employment and Training Commission in Great Britain in 2014 revealed that 17 percent of the reasons why employers were responsible for vacancies in terms of lack of language skills were involved.
So more and more language skills are essential to bring young people into a future career.
Taking into account the more spectacular workplaces that require knowledge of moles, these skills are essential in the globalized world.
Whether you learn another language in the future, it's a real benefit that you'll have that kind of skills for your whole life.
It is possible to contact people from other countries automatically in front of a multilingual person in the middle of competitors.
In a 2013 YouGov survey where over 4,000 adults in Britain participated, 75 percent failed to speak quite well in a foreign language to speak, and French was the only language that spoke ambiguously -15 percent.
That's why investment in language learning is now important for modern children.
The availability of several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages it teaches.
The school range will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered most important to the UK when looking towards the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interest of your child, in independent schools, you will always have a choice from a few languages with a tutorial warehouse that is specialists in that field.
Scottish independent schools seek to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and armed them with the skills they need to achieve success, whatever is going to happen in the future.
At present, you can't deny that, in the global working environment, language is still vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be viewed as “the habits of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice further, variety and advantage for youth in Scotland.
This should be done
John Edward - Director of the Scotland Council of Independent Schools
Lebron debuts on Sunday to San Diego
Waiting for adversaries to see Lebron James do his first start with "Los Angele Lakers".
Louis Walton announced that James was playing a pre-sessional Sunday opening against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes it plays, you still have to determine.
"It'll be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on the official Lakers site.
Corespondent Lakers Mike Trudell wrote that James would probably be playing in a limited minute.
According to the practice this week, James was asked about his plans on the "gathering pre-session graphs".
"I don't need pre-session games at this stage of my career to prepare myself," he said.
It's time you spoke the Trump in West Virginia, channel for YouTube
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump is starting a lot of shares of the company.
This is the first of five scheduled speakers of the Trump next week, including pauses in friendly places, Tennessee and Місісi.
When a vote is confirmed by an arrival on the election, in order to fill the Vacation of the Congressional Court, the Tramp seeks to enhance support for the forthcoming intermediate elections, as the Republics are at risk of losing their control over Congress when the voices are given in November.
So when does the tram show up tonight in West Virginia, and how do you look at it on the Internet?
Trump's excitement in Wyling, West Virginia, scheduled for seven o'clock in the evening. ET tonight, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can look at the Trump talk in West Virginia on the internet below in a direct ether on YouTube.
The trump is most likely to be heard this week on candidature before the Bret Cavan Overseas Court, which has problems with the charges of sexual harassment of the expected sponsorship of the Senate of Voices during the week's investigation of the FBI.
But the main goal of these talks is to help the Republicers see if they're going to decide in November.
In this way, the President's Tramp campaign announced that the five speakers next week were aimed at “activizing the activities of volunteers and adversaries, as the Republics are trying to protect and extend the majority of them have in the Senate and the Palate Representatives”, reports Reuters.
"Congression is so important to him in the order of the day that the president will go to the maximum possible number of states as we enter the strenuous pre-eligibility season," said Reuter the spokesperson for the Thrump company.
Planned on Wesbanco Arena in Wyling, today's action can attract adversaries from Agaye and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pitzburg media," - reported The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month when the Temple visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percent points in 2016.
The trump is trying to help the candidate in the Senate from West Virginia Patrick Morris, who is the leader in surveys.
"It's not a good sign for Morris that the president has to come to try to give him a jolt in the interviews," said Siman Heder, a coatologist from the University of West Virginia, reports Reuters.
Ryder's Cube 2018: The U.S. team is moving towards the fight to keep hopes for life on Sunday
After three lop-sided Saturday sessions, perhaps it was what the Ryder Cup needs to do.
A pulse penis that grows out is a completely invented sports concept that players sincerely believe in and nothing more than similar competitions.
So where would they say a ping now?
"They've had the advantage of six points, and now--four, so I think we're passing through this with a little impulse," said Jordan Sleep, strolling for the day.
The advantage of Europe, of course, is four points forward, and in the game is another twelve.
Americans, as says Ask, feel that they had lightly blown up the wind; and they have had what to expect, not the least, from the form of Spate and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long, and each one could brag about three of the four.
The spate was mortal from football to green and is an example.
These guttural feasting shouts were getting all the more loud as his round lengthed, and he dragged the decisive stab to play at a four-field match when they with Thomas yielded two by two.
His blow, which allowed them to win in a match of 15, was met in a similar shriek, like that which tells you that he believes that the American team is not off.
"The demand is simply to dig up and worry about your own match," said the Spitie.
It's already each of these players gone.
18 holes to make the score.
In the last two days, the only players that have acquired more points than the Spate and Thomas are Francesca Malinars and Tommy Flitwood, the safe story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but admirable pairs in Europe four in four and can do nothing wrong.
"Mallywood" were the only couple, who did not make gods on Saturday, the afternoon, but they also escaped the gods on Saturday morning, Friday and afternoon on Friday.
It goes on, and as their energy seems to be flowing to this tempestuous crowd and from it, and it affirms that they are players that win in a Sunday, and that there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than the Flitwood or the Malinars.
Both these holes I have requested at the same time.
The conversation about European glory remains untimely.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson did a short work on Sergei Garcia, a hero of the morning van when he was married to Alex Knorren.
The gods and the two deputies on the front of the nine dug dug burst out of the Spanish and steered him from which they couldn't get out.
On Sunday, nevertheless, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
It's four balls, and four balls, and it's so interesting to watch closely over the interaction of the pairs, the parade that they give, the advice that they fail, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe had thus become the best team and had taken a significant role in the last day, but on this fourth meeting also indicated that the US team sought to fight in which some had doubted, particularly in the United States.
Europe goes to the final Reider Cup with a number 10-6
Europe will have a good preference for the last day of the Raider Cup after it emerges from four sabbath balls and fours, preferring 10 to 6 over the United States.
Inspired by Tommy Flitwood and Francisco Malinar to fight two wins over Thaiger Woods to report to Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, trying to save the trophy that they had played in Hazardine two years ago, reigned in the American sanction of displeasure in the morning by getting a series of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the match for four balls by winning two matchs, but they failed to do more.
To keep a trophy, side Jim Furrick is to get eight points of the 12 single matches on the Sunday.
Flitwood is the first European noble who won four points in a row and he and the robin who got the name Molliwood after the sensational exits is the only second pair that won four points in his first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
Smashing Woods and Patrick Reid on four balls, they peculiarly frozen to win the dropped Woods and the American braceman Bracean Decomb is still five and four more and four more.
Woods, who spent himself in two matches on Saturday, showed a random splash of gleam, but now he plays 19 out of 29 times in the matches of four balls and four in a row and seven in a row.
Justin Rows, who was resting on x four balls, went back to Henryk Stronsson's four balls to parase 2-1 Dustin Jones and Brooks Coepki -- takes up one and the other in the world.
Europe hadn't had its way, though was a pleasant, fresh day south of west of Paris.
On Saturday, Jordan Spate and Justin Thomas, the three-fold chief winner, set up a checkpoint for the Americans in two counts.
They won two and one over John Ram and Ian Pulter from Spain at the four balls and returned later to win Puler and Rory Macilroy 4 and 3 in the four, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team return from a four-point deficiency which goes on alone, though the Furick's owners need only to draw to keep the affair.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack in the Sunday looks as if they would all get.
North Korea says that "no way" will be disarmed in one side of the way without trust
The Foreign Minister of the North Korea said that the United Nations continued sanctioning on Saturday that exacerbated the suspicion of the United States and in such circumstances the country could not give up nuclear weapons in the same order.
Rie Yun Ho said to the Annual World Assembly last year in which North Korea took “significant goodwill measures”, such as stopping nuclear and missile plot trials, dismantling the nuclear zone of trials, and promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"One way we don't see a proper answer from the U.S.," he said.
"No trust to the US will be assured in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way of disarming itself first of all."
Despite the fact that Ri has banished the abuses of North Korean complaints against Washington's "Postope" approach to dnucleus, within which the North Korea was rewarded because she took enticements, his statement was significant in that he didn't deny a lop-sided deucleurization notification that was done to Phnyans in the past.
Ri referred to a communicating statement by Kim Cheng Yen and Donald Trump at the first in the history of the president's summit in Singapore on June 12, when Kim Poabies were working on the path to the Korean Peninsula Edition, the Temple promised to give security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea is committed to finishing the war officially in Korea from 1950 to 53, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang should first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington, too, resisted the call to reverse cruel international sanctions against the North Korean.
"The United States of America first insists on "denuclement" and increasing pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its purpose in a forceful manner, and even speaks against 'the declaration of the end of the war,' says Ri.
"The recollection of what pandemics can put us on our knees is the unforgettable dream of people who don't know anything about us.
But the problem is, the flow of sanctions deepens our mistrust."
Ri didn't mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. boss mentioned earlier this week in the Organization of the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Mun Je-in, during the last five months, and added, "If the member of this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not U.S., the denuclency of the Korean half-strike would not be such a deadlock."
However, the tone of Ri was sharply different from last year's when he spoke to the UNA General Assembly that the targeting of the U.S. continent with North Korean missiles was inevitable after Mr. President Zla's Trump called Kim's “Raketchic” assassin.
This year 'An AN Trump, who last year threatened 'end erase' North Korea, commended Kim for his boldness to take action on separation, but said that there would be still much to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclearized.
In Wednesday, Trump reported that he had no time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued with UNA. The Security Council stated that it should be rewarded with action.
However, the U.S. secretary. Mike Pampéa told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that, "The dissolution of the Sentences of Security Council has to take place actively and absolutely until we make sure of the complete, final and true dnucleus."
The Security Council strengthened the sanctions against North Korea in 2006 to stop the financing of Phenyana nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pampiea met Ri in Soviet Security, and the General Assembly then declared that he would next month visit Phongyang to prepare for the next alone.
Pampeaa had visited Northern Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In a slippery he left Pyongyang claiming that the progress achieved with the North Korean for several hours rags ended by a visa that he introduced the requirements “like gangstaes”.
In a meeting with the Munom this month, North Korea has pledged to remove the missile installation and the nuclear complex when the United States will take the “match measures”.
The Tramp said that, according to Kima's “match measures”, he awaits, it is a security guarantee and a desire to normalize relations with Washington, D.C., which the Temple promised to Singapore.
Harvard students are running a course on the right rest.
The new Harvard University course this year has to train students to sleep any longer, and I want to combat a culture to learn night with a coffee in my hand.
The researcher concluded that students in one of the best universities in the world often don't know how to look after themselves and their health.
Charles Chasler, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a British hospital, and a female hospital, developed a course that he believed is the first in his birth in the United States.
So inspired by a statement about the impact of a lack of sleep on learning, he started a course.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me that just now, in the last course of school?"
"She said that nobody ever told her about the importance of sleep was a surprise to me," he said to the Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course taught by students explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports achievements and also enhance common moods.
Paul Barreyra, a professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School, and performing a university health director, said that the university had decided to enter a course after it was found that students were often denied sleep for a week.
The course that lasts an hour includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there's an image of the room on the internet where students click on coffee cups, curtains and books describing the effect of the cafein and light and how the lack of sleep contributes to sporting metrics, as well as the importance of sleep habits.
At the outset, participants were telling how a lot of years of sleep avoiding might increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depressions, and cancers.
A map of a кампusa, with interactive pictures, inviting the participants to think about their daily lives.
"We know it won't change student behavior instantly.
But we think they need to know that, just as everybody knows the health consequences of smoking," said Professor Chasler.
He said, "The culture of nighttime nights still exists by adding that modern technology, and by constantly increasing pressure from students leads to sleep-freeing, which comes with a growing problem.
"The abundance of sleep of good quality must be a "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and alarm," he said, "even to avoid the excess weight, as the loss of sleep makes the brain permanently hungry."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student, who was studying chemical and physical biology, was assisting professor Chasler in the development of the course.
He said that course opened his eyes and inspired to curl everyone on the кампusse.
He hopes that the next step will be a request to all assyrants to complete a similar learning program before they get to university.
Professor Chasler recommended that students should be able to set their watch to know if to go to sleep and when to wake up, noticing the adverse consequences of "blue light" that emanate from monitors and light light lighters that can change the networking mode, causing problems of sleeping.
Livingstone 1:0, Reinjeers: Menga kills bare Gerarda.
Reingers was subjected to another attack when Valley Mangie was assured that Stephen George was not going to be hit by 1:0 at Liveingstan Stadium.
Ibranx wants to save his first victory in a 4-1 triumph in St. Johnston, but Gary Holton's team carries the second time as George's host of 18 games to leave on his side of the eight Points, stand back against the leader of the Ladbroks Hearts Premier.
I've hit man in seven minutes until he stops, and Ranggers, pushed his head, didn't look like he was holding right away.
At the same time, Reingers drops in the sixth place, Livingstan climbed to the third place, behind him, Hibernan with a difference in swords.
For Reingers, more problems can arise after the forward Calum Spence has to get away with the injuries of his head after he got a piece thrown out of the courtyard.
George made eight changes of players because Ira hadn't played half final Batfred's Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went along with the same Libya down to 11 rooms that allowed him to pick up an entry from his heart last week, and was excited about the way they were walking around their opponents at all times.
Reingers was more likely to possess a ball, but Libyastan has made more attempts to kill the ball.
They should have killed already in two minutes when for the first time Mengie headed the ball across the koto Pitman to the gate of Allan McGregar, and then the half-agent used that chance.
Jacobs Caigan's successful fine strike sang off suddenly Craig Halket; but his partner in the defence of Alain Litgos managed to strike back.
Reinhers took control, but the last third of the game was expected to kill more than the shower of the good game.
Alfred Marelas, of course, was to be punished with a fine for a quarter of an hour before the end, when he and Stephen Loules met on the field, but Judge Stephen Tomson did not take a complaint from Colombia.
Reingers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but the Aibrox gateway Lyam Kelly almost gave Hol Lassan Culibali and the effective Ovi Ehiriya atac.
While killing the first bar for 34th minute of Libya, maybe was against the next active game, no one minds that they should show a good caucus game.
Reinhers was unable to beat Jacobs' gate again.
Scott Arfield didn't retaliate when Declan Galacher gave pass Robinson, who locked Mang to get a chance to kill in the gate.
George changed his job at the Kulibali break on Ryan Kent, and it proved an effective impact when attacking Marelas but a startling Kally jumped in and blocked the blow.
But "Livingstan" continued to suit visitors playing that game, which they liked, and the Lithuanian and Halkette continued to share the ball after the long opposition.
Bok Holt could only change in the last minutes, but McGregar was playing well to resist Jacobs before Lithuania went out for the spare bench.
Reingers Glenem Midlton's replacement took place on one occasion after the penalty he had been punished and he encountered Jacobs, but Tomson succeeded in swaying.
Almanah: I invented a Geiger counter.
A page from our almanac is “an Sunday morning”: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and PADLlCI... the day of future physicist Igon Wilhelm Hans, born in Germany.
Geiger designed the detection and measurement method of radioactivity which as a result led to the emergence of the tool known as the Geiger.
The Geiger County became part of the science and came into a pop culture, as in the 1950 "Karanad Calls" film, where those who seemed to be a little-aware scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were involved.
Man: by whom is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is the counter of Geiger that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put your earphones in your earphones, you'll really have the opportunity to hear the sounds of atoms giving rise to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, is it really cracking now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 -- just a few days to 63 days from his birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continue to use.
A new progressive vacancy can help the immune system view cancer cells.
A new anti-racial window can help the immune system see and destroy bad cells.
A window, as it teaches the immune system to recognize the bad cells that will be a part of treatment.
The method specifies how people get immune cells from their patient and how they change them in the lab.
Then the cells can "see" the squirrels spread in many mud cells, and then reintroduce the helper cells.
Dashing a glass shows successful results for patients with different cancer.
One woman who was introduced by a vacancy that helped the immune system recognize cancer cells saw that the cancer of proteins disappeared for 18 months.
The method includes receiving immune cells in a patient's condition, changing them into a laboratory so that they can see the HER2 squirrel as common to many cancer cells, and then being repeatedly entered.
This is what Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Institute of Cancer in Beethsen in Maryland, whose findings show that there's a very perspective vacancy.
"HER2 stimulates the growth of a number of species of anti-Cathed cells fighting clandestine cancer, cattle, light and thick cats," said Professor Berozafsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and learning them to reach cancer cells is good at treating leukose.
Kanie West proceeded to a discussion in support of the Trump, bearing the title of the MIHA, after it appeared in the U.S.N.
That didn't work well.
In the studio during the evening of Saturday evening, Kanie West was obscured after a talk where he praised the United States.[1] President Donald Trump said he would be ache for the second term in 2020.
After performing the evening of his third song called the City-Vhost, when he was in the Cape 'Make America Again Great', he protested against democrats and confirmed his support for the Trump.
"How many times am I talking to the whites and they said, "How can you support the tramp, it's racist?"
"Well, if I were troubled because of racism, I'd have long since left America," he said.
NLS began to show with the main role of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star cracked on the testimony of Bret Kavano before the Senate courtroom during the investigation of the sexual assault of Cristina Blace Ford.
Despite the fact that it wasn't broadcast, the words of the West pope to the frame were downloaded into the social media comic by Chris Rock.
It doesn't clear if Rock was trying to get unchanged from West.
Besides, West complained of the audience that he had had a heavy time behind the bullets.
They crashed by me over the balloons.
They said, "Don't go there with that shit.
They made out on me.
"And then they say that I am in a magnificent place," he said, as the Washington Examiner reported.
West went on, you want to see a magnificent place?
Try to love.
Because of his statements, at least twice the hearings were closed, and SNA representatives were puzzled by a message from Veroiti.
West was taken as the replacement of Ariana Grande's singular; whose former fellow, raper McMiller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many by the execution of song I love it, dressed in a bottle of water Perrier.
West was supported by the TPUSA conservative party manager, Kendez Turner, who wrote on the Twitter, "One of the most courageous spirits, thank you for supporting."
But leading up to the point of Karen Hantter wrote that West is just one who he is, and it is always delicious.
"But I have decided not to reward anyone by buying his music or his clothes, or by supporting his "creature," which I believe, embraces and twists the ideology, which harms my community.

She added, "as well as we do."

A 45-year-old was accused of attempting to murder after a restaurant in east of Belfast on a second-husband attacked on Friday.
The incident was in Balihakomore just like the police report.
It's expected that the accused will appear on Monday in the Belfast Court.
The prosecutions will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Guard-tron star of Khariington was peaked out by idealized brutality.
Kit Harrington is known for his swinging sword and the role of John Snow in the "Guel of Heavens" series in the Battle of Medieval HBO
But the 31-year-old actor has got a stereotype of stepmother's hero, which means young boys often feel more bitter to respect.
Speaking in the Sunday Times Department, the Cat said he believed that "something had happened" and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the age of #MeToo.
The whale, who recently married his neighbor, Rovez Leslie, who is also 31, admits that it feels the power to solve this problem.
"I personally feel like a strong guy--when we were wrong with courage?" he said.
"Why do we teach men when they grow up, from a point of view that we see now?"
The whale considers that television must be responsible for the appearance of brutality because of the very gently character.
He went on, "What lies at the beginning, and why should it be taught?
Why teach on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel they should be so sure to be the real person?
I think it's really one of the biggest questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because obviously something happens to young people.
And in the interview, he also confessed that the next summer the series will end and he'll get out of the battle series and he won't do the docks or the squills for the Round Chrones.
From November the Cat begins to revive the real Western Sam Shaferd, who is a Historical director with his brother, who is a slave.

HEAR / AIDS: China reports of an increase in new cases by 14%
China announced that the number of citizens living with HlV and AIDS had increased by 14 percent.
According to health workers, over 820,000 people are infected.
It was only about 40,000 new cases registered during the second quarter of 2018.
Most new cases have been passed through sex as in the past.
Traditionally, HlV infection is spreading to some parts of China as a result of infectious blood transfusions.
"One thing about the number of people infected with HlV through blood transfusions has fallen to nearly zero," said the Chinese officials for a conference in the province of JUNE.
However, with each year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000.
The transmission of HlV through sex is an acute problem of LGBT subpol in China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT is before.
Because of conservative property, about 70 to 90 percent of the men who have sex with men are eventually married to women.
Many diseases are spreading from inadequate knowledge and sexual control.
Since 2003, the Government of China has had universal access to drugs from HlV as part of its efforts to solve this global problem.
Maxine Voters rejects the merged, danger and the theory of conspiring her employees of Parliament
U.S. Congrossumman Maxine Voters dropped on Saturday accusations in that her colleague put out personal information about three U.S. Senators on Wikipedia pages.
Democrates of Los Angeles stated that the claim is to be part of the super right wing and their websites.
"Lord, lie, and many awful lies," says Vetters in Twitter.
The information reported here includes the home addresses and phone numbers in the United States, says Lyndsi Grem of South Korea, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information placed by an unknown man at the Capitali Hill during the hearings of the Senate Commission on Indictments of Sexual Harassment against a member of the Bret Cavano High Court appeared on the internet on Thursday.
The fugitive occurred a while after the three Senators questioned the Kavano.
"Public sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was connected to the Waters office and distributed information to a member of Watters team," reported Hill.
"It's an unreasonable argument completely false and absolutely false," held Vaters.
"The part of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these rusty accusations and false accusations, was never in any way responsible for the flow of this information.
It's an entirely false and absolutely false argument."
The application Vaters quickly caused the criticism on the Internet, including the former secretary of the White House, Ara Flaucher.
"That is a refusal to anger," she wrote.
This indicates that she has no courage to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of not doing, they must not get angry.
They must not lead themselves outrageously.
They should not question the motives of their charges.
They must be calm and good-natured.
Fleischer compared the reaction Vaters to the democratic crisis to judge Kavano when they were accused of being too loose on Thursday.
The Lomar of Nabora, the candidate for the Republic party that talks about and participates in the intervening elections, also appeared in Twitter.
"It's a reciprocity when it's true," he wrote.
In her statement Voters stated that her office had warned the relevant authorities and the legal authorities about these false statements.
"We guarantee that the perpetrators will be found," she went on, "and they will hold legal responsibility for all their actions, which are discrete and dangerous to any of the staff of my team."
A look at Johnny English Strikes again strikes upon the invented spy Rhoen Akinson.
Now it's a tradition to look for BRECSITS in any new British slope movie, and this slope seems to have been in comedy and Eschn Francis Johnny Inglisch, which started in 2003 with Johnny Inglisch, and lasted in 2011, called "Option Johnny Inglisch."
Can the solicitor get a good expression in view of how clearly we look unseenly when we talk about new possibilities for export?
At any rate, the second time, when he appeared in the printing, an uncompetent Johnny Ingish was given the opportunity to laugh over the things--his name was more loud than all the comic creations that he did for not English spectators in cinematography.
Of course, he was a secret agent, who, in spite of his bizarre claim on glamour, got a little like Cluzo with Mr. Bin's features and a little tactics of a fellow, who brought the only note to the Hor fire on the ceremonies of the discovery of Alympics in London in 2012.
Initially his character was based on the traveller and the international mysteries of Atkins, who once played in the forgotten Barklakerd, leaving chaos on his way.
Here are some of the nice moments I have never had before.
I liked Johnny Inglis, who approaches the helicopter, dressed in a medieval furnace, and the blades of rotary a little knock on his heel.
Dar Atkinsson's for theatrical comedy is very appareling, but the humour is feeling weak, and so strange, especially when serious movies, like "Agent 007: The mission is extraordinary" are sure to offer comedy as the main part.
The humour feels like it's not just for adults, but for children, and even the ridiculous accidents of Johnny Inglische aren't as inventive as Atkinsson's monkey movies in a person called Bina.
The many-year-old current-setting is the serious problems of Great Britain.
Kiberhaker practised in a super-scrupulous British spies community in Great Britain, discovering the names of all British agents in place, disappointing the civil agent, it's unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldan.
So this is the last point for prime minister, who is an proud and mixed girl who is already suffering from political intolerance, and that's Emma Thompson doing everything that is possible with that quasi-Terece-May, but the script doesn't have anything like that.
Her intelligence consultants say that, because every real spy will be uncovered, it will have to influence some who are already retired.
And that means that for Johnny Inglis everything is complicated for himself, so now he works as a sixth teacher in a couple of swing institutions and he teaches us how to be an impossible operator -- some good examples here, because Inglesh is offering an Academy music classroom.
Ingliss came back at Whitehol for an extra briffin and joined in with his old, multi-year friend Bo who's playing Ben Miller again.
Nowadays Bo's my marriage, bound to a commander of a submarine whose role Vicky Pepperdin played a bit in vain.
So Betman and Robin get terribly wrong things in the secret Agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting up with a beautiful Volga Kurilenka woman.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has received a dangerous command from the charmary technical billionaire that claims to be able to solve the problem with the UK hackers, namely, Jason Volt, who is played by Jake Lace.
Mimmish and Bou are starting their eggs from immediate things, fossilinating to wait for an official, signing a French restaurant, creating a game to fight smugglers at Volta's board; and others are doing a clean anarchy because he's trying to use virtual reality styles to get acquainted with the Volta house interview.
All moments stretched out for the last event, but as pleasant and boisterous, which have quite a lot of childish in the television.
Quite a good stuff.
And what about the other movies about Johnny Inglis I couldn't think, could the British film industry give Rivan Atkinson a role that really shows his talent?
The Laborist party denys that it's a plan to pay to the British for a four-day work week, with payment for five days.
The Jerémi Corbin working party should consider a radical plan, if the British are only working four days a week but they are paid in five.
The party is reported to want companies to hand over the work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra weekend.
It was seen that the staff members would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still get the same wage.
The source indicates that the idea corresponds to the party's economic program and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
Trade union ride approved a four-day transition for a week as a good way to take advantage of economic change.
The eldest source of theлейborish party explained to The Sunday Times magazine: "The scheduled review of actions will be announced by the end of the year.
It's not going to happen now, but a four-day work week is an idea that conforms to the party's view and the overall industrial strategy for regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Leibrin Party is not the first one to approve of this idea, the Greens Party promises to have a four-day work week during the general campaign in 2017.
As a matter of fact, the Leiborish Party's attempts to the whole are not supported.
The Professor of Leiborist Party said, Four-day work week is not a party policy objective, and it's not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonell used the working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonell said that he had decided to reinstate power from 'brazil directors' and 'managers' to the communal industry.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also suggest that the current shareholder of water might not get back the whole package of shares, because the Laborist government could make a “recovery” on the basis of alleged violations.
He also affirmed that he was planning to bring workers into the campaign councils and create merging assets to hand over 10 percent of his own funds to employees who would hold annual dividends up to 500 pounds стерlings.
Lyndsie Graham, John Cannedy told for "60 minutes," that investigations by the FBI working with the Kavano must change his opinion
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bret Kavano was put to the final vote on his election to the Contingency Court at least a week, and the question is whether the Republic Senator's Bureau will be able to provide support.
In an interview of the ether on Sunday, Scott Paley asked the Republicans Johnny Cannedy and Lindsey Graham about the Sens: Can the FBI unravel anything that might lead to change?
Canedy proved more open than his colleagues in South Korea.
"I mean, of course," said Kenya.
"I said going to the court meeting and I spoke to Judge Kavano.
I rang him afterwards, and asked him about the reason of the accusation, asking, "Have you done it?"
He was resolute and unambiguous."
The head of Graham, however, seems final.
"I think Bret Kavano has decided that this would be a scandalous accusation," he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what's happened, but I know it, Bret is resolutely denying it," added Graham, referring to Cristina Blaze Ford.
"And all she calls were unable to believe it.
She's only 36 years old.
I don't see anything new."
What is the International Citizen festival, and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday day in New York there is an International festival: a annual music event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers, and my mission is to stop poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, World Citizen's festival will take place on the great porch of the Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the Janet Jackson concert, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, and to find out about the real purpose of the event, to stop poverty and land by 2030.
The international civil festival that appeared in 2012 is the continuation of the global project against a global propaganda group that hopes to stop poverty because of the increase in the number of people who are actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket for an event (if you don't want to pay VIP bill) visitors had to carry out a number of tasks or “provide action”, be a volunteer, write on an email to the leader of the country, call any other woman and raise awareness about the purpose of stopping poverty.
But how successful was the citizens' festival for 12 years and how could it be?
Is it an idea to reward people with a free recital in a real way to convince people in the need of active action, or is it just another case called “cactivism” -- people feel that they are doing a good thing by signing online petitions or by sending tweets?
Since 2011, sponsors of festivals have reported that they have registered more than 19 million “access” from their adherents trying to achieve different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to push influential leaders into account over 37 billion dollars that can affect more than 2.25 billion people to live by 2030.
In the early 2018, the group brought 390 commentaries on commitments and an application for at least 10 billion dollars that had already been allocated or compiled.
Over the group's score, the funds have thus far rendered прямий influence to almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include providing nutrition, investor partnerships and performers based in the UK are “helping children to develop in full volume”, promising to provide Rwanda with 35 million dollars to help avoid reinvigoration in the country after obtaining over 4,700 Tweets from citizens.
“In support of the Government of Great Britain, Donors, National Governments and Citizens of Different Countries, we can eradicate social injustices in history,” said the Ambasador Tracy Ulman of London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares were launched calling in the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding a food relief project that reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In answer to one of the frequent questions on the site, "What makes you think we can end with poverty?"
The global festival replied, "This will be a long and difficult way; sometimes we will endure immediately, and we will fail.
But like the big civil rights and movements against apartheid, we'll succeed, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monae are one of the few players performing this year's event in New York by Debara-Li Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use VPU for “blacades” to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
"Вашington may, if necessary, appeal to the Navy to prevent the exit of Russian energy to the EC and the Middle East markets," said the secretary of the United States Ryan Zink, reports Washington Examiner.
The zinc argued that the Russian actions in Syria, in particular, where it operates on the invitation of the legal government, are a reason to learn new energy markets.
"I believe the reason for their stay in the Near East is that they want to acquire energy just as they want to be in Eastern Europe and south of Europe," he said.
And according to the employee, there's means and funds to cope with it.
"The United States has an opportunity by the Navy to ascertain the openness of the seaways, and, if necessary, to organize the block so that their energy will certainly not get on the market," he said.
In turn, he asked for participants in an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a non-profit group that positiones himself as “a lobster of energy consumers” in the U.S.
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"Economic alternatives to Iran and Russia is more or less equal to fuel and replaces fuel," he said, calling Russia the same country as the economy.
These statements appeared at the time when the Trump administration wanted to significantly increase the export of its pedestrian natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper alternative to European consumers.
For this, Trump administration officials, including the president of the United States Donald Trump, attempt to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “non-government” gas project entitled "North Truck 2", which, according to the Trump, turned Berlin as the “follow” Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly substantiated that the North stream of 2 gas production at the cost of $11 billion, which is created to double the existing gas right to 110 billion cubic metres, is exclusively an economic project.
Cross states that Washington's hard opposition takes the start with the economy and is an example of insane competency.
"I think we have the only view that energy cannot be a pressure tool, and that consumers must have the ability to pick suppliers," said Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting the U.S. Rick Pera Minister of Energy in September in Moscow.
The Americans were kicked in response to Germany, which reaffirmed its love of the project again.
The Chief German Industry Organization (BDI) called on the United States not to interfere with the EU's energy policy and the two-sided agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the third state interfereing with our supply of energy," said Dhither Kempf, head of the Federation of German Scientists (BDI), after a recent meeting between the chancellor of Germany Angela Mercel and the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going very seriously to discuss his participation in the 2020 Presidential elections, declares a senator from the state of Massachusetts
The Senator from Massachusetts of Elizabeth Waren stated on Saturday that would seriously consider her participation in the President's elections after the intervening elections.
During the talk in the mayor of Khalikia, Maschuciets, Worren confirmed that she was considering the possibility of her participation.
"It was high time for women to go to Washington and order our Sunday government, and I'm also talking about women in the highest positions," she said, agreeing to the "The Hill."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of chattering with the Presidents."
During the talk in the mayor of Waren, the president of Donald Trump attacked, saying that that one would "made the country in the wrong direction."
"I am extremely worried what the Temple is doing with our democracy," she said.
Worren was totally criticized by the Trump and his candidate before the Bret Cavano Rouge Court.
On Friday, Worren wrote in her tweet, "of course, before the voting needs the FBI to have the investigation done."
However, the surveys published on Thursday showed that most voters Worren do not think she should be beaten by the Presidents in 2020.
According to a survey of the center of political research at the University of Safalk/Boston Glovb, eight percent of the “mighty” voters said that the Senator shouldn't be балed.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The question showed much support from the rebel Deval Patrick -- where 38 percent was in vice versa and 48 percent in vice versa.
Other famous names among democracies, which were discussed in connection with the potential for chatting in 2020, include the former vice-president Joe Bayden and the Senator from Vermont Berní Sanders in the State of Vermont.
According to Associated Press Bayden, he said he's officially going to decide on a January.
On a trip back to Donald Trump Sarah Palin mentioned the post-tromic Trek Paulo syndrome
Trek Paulin, aged 26, spent a year in Iraq after arriving for service in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and he was accused of being charged in the domestic sculpture of
"The things through which my son goes after his return, I can compare with the results of a strained syndrome and wounds, with which our soldiers return, in other families," she said assembled on a departure in support of Donald Trump in Talls, Oklahoma.
Pauline called the arrest a “bolly question” and stated that her son, along with other veterans of war, was “to turn into a few other, tempered, return to the question whether there was the respect for which soldiers, pilots, other military forces fought, giving themselves to the country”.
He was arrested on Monday, in Uasilla, Alaska, and he was charged with the domestic violence against the woman, an obstacle to attempt to report the domestic violence, the wearing of weapons in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett's information, the press secretary of the police department Weasilla.
18 states and Colombia county support declaring new policies against the provision of the hurdle
Eighteen states and Colombia's county supports the challenge of a new U.S. policy that denys to be a victim of harassment by gangs or domestic violence.
18 states and Colombia's districts gave an analytic recording on Friday, in Washington to support policy protests on the supply of the whistle, reports to NBC News. (Laughter)
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sashnes, which was opened in August of the American Civil Rights Alliance against Federal Politics, was not disclosed.
She stated that her partner was "his friends with a stiff gang" raped her, but the U.S. authorities refused the wharf on 20 July.
She was delayed in Tehas.
The law states supporting Grayce described by El Salvador, Ganduras and Guatemala, yielding the largest number of requests for help in the United States, as countries with serious gang problems and domestic violence.
The New American Housing Politics changed the 2014 Appeals Commission decision to immigrants, which allowed immigrants to do without documents that are victims of domestic violence to resort to a shelter.
The Director-General of the Colombian county, Carl Reisin, stated in Friday that the new policy “signifies a decade of conjugal experience of states, countries and worlds”.
“The federal legitimacy requires that applications on the whistle be based on specific facts and circumstances, and similar change violates this principle,” says the analytical note.
The lawyers also stated in the note that policies that deny immigrants are worsening the economy in the United States, saying that immigrants can often come as entrepreneurs and “create necessary jobs”.
Director-General Jeff Sashnes ordered in June the judges for immigration cases to stop harnessing the victims of gang violence and violence.
“The predicament is to the one who leaves his country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or belonging to a social group or political opinion," said Sashins on June 11, proclaiming that policy.
The situation has never meant the solution to any of the problems, even of all the serious problems that people face every day.
A desperate rescue work in Palo. The attempt to find the survivors has doubled the number of survivors.
Survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"It's all very tense," says Rice Kusum's 35-year-old mother, reassuring her little son with a temperature at the evacuation centre of Pala destroyed.
"Every minute, the speed car brings a body.
It's very small for clean water."
The lodgers started going back to their destroyed houses, breaking down mockery things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were wounded and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-hour magnetic earthquake were filled.
Some of the wounded, including two Harris, who broke a vertebrae and a shoulder, are found outside the army hospital Pala where patients are treated in the streets because of the violent jolts that occur.
In his eyes there were tears when he recalled the feeling of strong underground jolts in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to move on.
I squeezed under the ruins of the wall," said Harris Associated Press, and added that his family had arrived in the city for a marriage.
"I heard her call for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my daughter.
I hope they're in security."
American Ambassador accuses China of “prohibitions”, using “Propagist advertising”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a quadrennial advertisement in the American daily, balancing the mutual benefits of the American-China trade, the American Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
American President Donald Trump in the last Wednesday mentioned the Chinese Daily in Des Moines Register -- the most sold newspaper in the state of Ayawa -- after China tried to intervene in the U.S. Congress on 6 November -- this is the accusation of China is aggrieved.
The accusation of the Trump that China had sold to intervene in the American elections indicated what American officials in the conversation with the Reuters was called the new phase in the Washington Press to China.
The placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice for trade, so Beijing And Washington have set up a trade war, which resulted in the reciprocal imaging of imports.
Repressive tariffs, said American and Chinese experts, were introduced to injure such exporters as entrepreneurs from the state of Ayaev who support the Republic's Trump Party.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. Ambassador of China, and the veilor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, said that Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Branstad in the author's Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, “now doubles its efforts by printing a propagandist advertisement in our free press.”
"Expressing its propaganda, the Chinese government uses a good American tradition of freedom of speech and free press by printing a paid advertisement at Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"And when you look at the newspaper canoes in Beijing, you will find not so many voices against and will not see the reality of other assumptions which the Chinese may have against the dangerous trailer in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist party of China," he wrote.
He adds that “one of the most influential Chinese newspapers refused the offer" printed his article, although he didn't call it.
Republishers push women voters on the eve of the intermediate elections with Phoiasc Kavano, warns analysts
While many prominent republics defend a candidate for the position of the Superior Judge Bret Kovano in front of a number of charges of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would receive a blow in response, especially from women, during the interim elections.
Emotions around this were very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
"These things can't be returned," said Grant Richard, professor of political science at Maxwell of the Syracus University, for the article "The Hill" and was published on Saturday.
The Richard stated that he was not sure that statements by Senator Jeff Flake (Arison) about the investigation from the FBI would be enough to calm down the angry voters.
"Women aren't going to forget what happened yesterday--they won't forget it tomorrow and November," stated on Friday Carin Jean-Pierre, the chief adviser, and the national media secretary of the MoveOn progress group in Washington, Colombia.
On Friday morning, protesters scanned the Listapod Fast! "in the event of a demonstration in the Hall of Senate, when the Republicans who control the legal committee decided to put out a candidature for the Kavano despite the statement by Dr. Cristina Blace Ford, according to Mic.
"Enthusiasm and motivation of democracy will be extremely big," stated St. Rotenberg's news site, an independent political analyst.
'People say they're already tall and it's true.
But maybe even higher, especially among primitive women, and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who at least don't like the president, but often don't vote."
Even before the public statement Ford, in which she gave the candidate's accusations to the Contiguous Court for Sexual Abuse, analysts believe that if the Republicans insist on confirmations, they might have a strong shot in reply.
"For a Republic party it has become a mess," said Michael Steel, former chairman of the National Communist Party at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"The talk is not about voting by the committee or on final vote, or about whether to get the Cavano to office. "The talk is about how the Republicans dealt with this and how they put themselves before it," noticed Gay Cessil, Privorities Director, the group that helps to select democracies.
However, it looks like the Americans were divided into the question of the rightt Ford or the Cavano, with a little more acting in favour of the last.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents probably don't really trust the Ford statement, while 35 percent said they probably don't really trust it.
Besides that, 38 percent said that they believed it was possible or probably wrong in their statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a push by Flake, the FBI investigates the charges of Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports the Guardian.
Last week Ford made a statement in front of the Juridical Committee of the Senate, that of Kavano, when he was drunk, attempted to do it at the age of 17.
Ramirez argues that the candidate for the Rear Court showed her their genitals at a party when they were studying in Aile in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web Finder will launch the New Internet in order to compose Google and Facebook
The Tim Berners Lie, the inventor of the world's web, runs a startup that will be a competitor of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology legend project, Inrupt, is a campaign built on the open platform of Berners-Li Solid.
Solid allows users to select the place of storage and who have permissions to access this information.
In an exclusive interview, Fast Company Berners-Lee fired that, in making an Inrupt, he meant "Prince of the World."
"You must do it now," he said about a startup.
"It's a historical moment."
Application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own repository of data on the Internet or POD.
This may contain contact lists, vocabulary lists, calendar, fanatic and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available all at once at the same time.
The unique identity of personal vaults on the Internet is that only the user determines who accesss any type of information.
The company calls it "instantial reinforcement of the potential with data."
In the opinion of the Executive Director of the company, John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company an opportunity to combine the resources, the process and the necessary skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company now is Berners-Li, Bruce, the security platform that IBM bought, a few developers working on a contractual project, and co-driven co-maintainers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can develop their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt Web site.
Brence-Li said he and his team didn't talk from "Facebook and Google about whether to make or not a complete change when all their business models will be instantly re-engaged.
"We don't ask them permission."
In a Saturday publication on the question of Medium Berners-Li wrote that the Inrupt mission “is the provision of commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect integrity and the quality of a new network created by Solid.”
In 1994 Berners Lie transformed the internet by creating a Consortium of the World Wide Web in the Massachusetts Institute.
Berners Lee has been very powerful in overcoming the neutrality of the web in the last few months.
Even when run Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director, Consortium of the World Wide Web, the Web Foundation and the Open-Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new age of the web," added Berners Lie.
Bernard Wang: Recognition of the clergyman rewarded with Victoria for World War I
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church, rewarded by the Bridge of Victoria, during the first world war as a member of the battles, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
The underpaper of the majestic Bernard Van was rewarded on 29 September 1918 for participating in Belingles and Leakur's Atrocities.
However, after four days he died of a sniper balloon and never found out what had got the highest military wages in Britain.
On Saturday, in Rushden town, the county Narthhemptonshire two of his grandchildren on paradium opened a monumental stone.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wang, said it's "very symbolic," that the stone is opening exactly 100 years after his grandfather's reward.
According to London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, he led his battalion across the Canal of San Quentin “with a thick Імgle and under a strong pink and balloon fire by a worker's worker.”
Then he ran on the fireline and "much boldness" led the soldier forward, self- grabbing the gun and throwing out the three troops.
The underpaper Van was killed by the German sniper on 4 October 1918 and a little more than a month later the war was over.
Michael Wang, aged 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were “the thing I could never do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, also exalted a wreck after the parade that was headed by the Imperial young orchestra of Brantwood.
Michael Wang said that "for him a great honour to take part in the parade" and added that "the true manship of the hero was demonstrated by the support that many have."
MA's shave waited a whole night to see the Bellator 206; they'd instead got the lead of Pepa
Imagine you stood back all night to look at the packaged gear from Bellator 206 and then they refuse to view the main event.
In the program of San José there were 13 fightings, including six on the main map, and they were shown in direct air all night at the British Telescope Channel 5.
And the sixth morning, when Gérard Musassi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the bunch, Gazette in Great Britain was just ashamed when the program changed to be Pepa's pig.
Some had been disappointed after they had spent a wreckless night, especially waiting for that fight.
One of the tweet ballers has the name switching to a baby cartoon as "some stupid joke."
In response to the question of broadcasting Dave Schwartz, the senior vice president of Marketing and Communications, said, "Atttent from the decision of the State at 6:00 a.m., this content was inappropriate and it had to be switched to the baby program."
"Yes, the Pep Mount."
The President of Bellator Scott Coker said that the future they would work on the program to take into account the British audience.
"I believe we're discussing the possibility of repeating, I think, we can solve this question," said Coker.
'But now the sixth morning of Sunday, and we'll be unable to decide it till Sunday in our time, and that's the Monday of their time.
But we're doing everything we can.
You can imagine when the programs changed, we got lots of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We had tried to solve the question because we thought it was a technical error.
But this has turned out to be the agency of the State.
I can tell you that the next time it's gone, there's no way to go.
We'll cut the number of races from six to five, as we do usually, this together we wanted to advise fans, but it's late.
It's an admirable situation."
"Those inhumane island": Tom Daley felt "unimportant" because of sexuality
Alympic ghost jumping in water Tom Daley said that the steady sensation of secrecy for others due to his sexuality had given him motivation in the way of success.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not everyone like me" until he went to high school.
Addressing Radio 4 "The Indians of the Dead Island" at the Leader Loran Lavern, he said he supported the rights of gays to reach others with hope.
Also, he stated that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the lipse.
Traditionally leading this pretty old Dirty Yang program, took rest for a few months because of illness.
In the role of the man who found himself on the desertless island, in Lovern's first program Daley said that he felt like "little" in his childhood because "the software didn't take the people who liked both boys and girls."
He said, "I also now believe that this feeling that you're not quite important and small was what gave me strength and inspiration for success."
He wanted to prove that there was someone who said he wouldn't disappoint those who knew about his sexuality.
A two-fold bronze prize of lympics has become a significant LGBT activist and in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said he had expressed his opinion, for he had the chance to live freely, without persecution and wanted to give the hope to others.
A three-year-old world champion said that when he fell in love with a man -- American scripting, directors and professors Dustin Lance Blecke -- "it was unexpected to me in 2013."
Daley married Oscar's owner, who was 20 years older than he was last year, but he said the difference in age doesn't matter.
"If you go through it in such a young age" -- at the first alibi he got at the 14-year-old age and even three years later his father died of cancer-- he said it was difficult to find the novel who would have survived such upheavals and events.
In June they became parents, their son is Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said his "perspectives completely" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd tell you that I need to win the golden medal," he said.
"You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the golden almpic medal.
Robbie is my golden almpic medal."
His son is also known as his father -- Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't take the fact that one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had bought tickets for the 2012 London alimony -- he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him," you wouldn't sit in the first row, Dad," he said.
"I kept his hand when he had stopped breathing, and only when he had stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year Daley competitored on alympic 2012 and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that it was about this dreaming of my whole life-- jump in the water in front of his bastards in the Alympic game, that's the best feeling," he said.
And that also affected the selection of the song -- Proud of Heather Smol -- which found in it the feedback in preparation for the alympics and from which the ants are running now.
"The devilless island" can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 in British summer time.
Michaelson, who is not in uniform, stays at the bench of spares in the Ryder's cup of Saturday
American Phil Miquellson is on Sunday to put the record by playing his 47 matches into the Ryder cup, but he has to reform until it's a miserable event.
Michaelson, who will play in this contest, held once every two years, рекорд 12th times, Captain Jim Fürik planted on the bench of reserved for a sabbath form.
Rather than being at the centre of the event, while he was often there for the United States team, a five-fold winner of the cup shared his days between the work of the cheerer and the training, hoping to return to form.
Even on the pie of his career, he wasn't the best player, and now the 48-year-old golf player is not a perfect choice for the ill-looking Le Golf National field, where the indignant blows are cruelly punished.
And when the field is not bleak enough, Michaelson, who is in the nine matches Sunday, will fight against the exact champion of British Open Francisco Malinar, who and Tommy Flitwood won all four matches this week.
When Americans stopping by four points in 12 single matches start with success, Micelson's match can be extremely important.
The Fürik expressed confidence in this player, but he could not say anything any more.
"He fully understood his role today, handwriting me on the back, the suits, and said that tomorrow he would be ready," said Fürik.
"He's quite sure of himself.
He was taken to the glory hall and gave very much a team last and this week.
Perhaps I had not planned it on two matchs.
I had planned more, but it was how we thought to play.
He wants to be out on the fields, as well as all the others."
Michaelson will beat up the record of Nick Falls by the number of matches in the Ryder's cup, played on the Sunday.
It could be the end of a career in a cup of Ryder who had never been the same as achievements in individual games.
In Miquelsana 18 winners, 20 wins, and seven shelves, although Fürik said his presence brought great benefits.
"He is a funny, sarcastic, with a humour, likes to fire over people and just a very good man who is good at a team," he explained.
"I believe that more young players gladly parrot his jests, too, and this week, and it was a good thing to see.
He gives a team much more than just a game."
The captain of the European Command Thomas Bjorn knows that a great breakthrough might soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, from experience knows that a significant break before individual games last day on the teapot of Ryder may easily disappear.
Danish player debuted in a 1997 match in Walderam, where the European team, under the direction of Civ Balesteras, preferred five points over the Americans, but ended with a minimum advantage of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that in Walderama we've had a great advantage and won, but we've had a great deal of difficulty in Brooklyn where we've lost," said Bjorn after watching how the class team of 2018 won 5-3 and Friday and yesterday and took a number 10-6 on Le Golf National.
"The story shows me also to everyone else in the team, that it doesn't end yet.
Tomorrow must play at all a hundred.
Quit the box and do it correct.
Till the glasses appeared in the table, nothing over.
We've got a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, which is what we're going to focus on.
I'm constantly saying this, and I focus on 12 players on our side, but we really understand that the world's best players are on the opposite side."
Desirable of the way his players played on the heavy golf field, Bjorn added, "I'm never going to overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be another game.
The next day you'll have an individual game, and that's different.
Well, it's great, if you're in a field with a partner and it's all right, but if you're playing alone you're a real golfist's talent.
That's what we have to deliver to the players that they have to show the best for tomorrow.
Now you have to leave your partner, the pit needs to go, and show you everything the best for the individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his partner, Jim Fürik, hopes for the best individual game of his sportsmen than the one they showed in partnership with, except George Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Fürik himself was on both sides of those matches of the last day, playing on the winning team in Brooklyn and playing when Europe had a "Cud in Medina."
"I remember every word from this," he said, answering the question as Ben Crenshaw, the Captain of 1999 fixed his players for the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you always want to have a quick start that you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
As the velocity grows, the greatest pressure comes from those who play the match in the middle.
We set the appropriate layout and placed the players in the way we liked them. You know, to-morrow we are trying to get a bit of magic."
Thomas has got the task of starting to play back and виступing against Rory McHilroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Raws, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood, and Ian Paulter will play against top-golfers.
"I've put my players in this order, because I believe I'm going to close everything," said Bjorn about his choices for individual matches.
Dumping new German military ship again deferred
The new WMF WMF Germani was required to enter the construction site in 2014 to replace the old military ships of the Cold War, but it will appear no sooner than the next year because of the bad systems and the ever-growing costs of messages from local media.
The Rheinland-Pfalz launch, the main ship of the absolute new class of fregates Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed to the first half of 2019, as the newspaper Die Zeit quoted as a military representative.
The ship was supposed to be in line in 2014, but the troubles that happened after the building hindered that ambitious project.
Four military ships of the class of Baden-Wuerttemberg commissioned in 2007 should replace the old Bremen fregates.
They'll be armed with powerful guns, with various anti-propelled and diamond missiles, and some rocket technology, for example, will be reduced visibility for radars, infrared and occlastic signatures.
Among the other important characteristics -- the longer periods between technology -- the more new fregates may not be entering their ports until two years.
However, persistent delays mean that modern warships--who might let Germany demonstrate its power outside the country--are expired as long as they finally enter the building, notes Die Zeit.
The miserable fregate F125 got into the headlines last year, when German WMF officially refused to take the ship and returned his ship's shipyard Blohm & Voss to Hamburg.
The first Navy rotated the ship onto the ship after delivery.
For reasons of return, of course, little but German media wrote about many “defects in software and hardware” that made a ship void in a combat mission.
The software disadvantages were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are only 120 sailors, a half of the old Bremen fregate crew.
It also turns out that the ship has a very large scale, constraining its productivity and limiting the possibility of further updating.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons more than the weight of ships like this class that used Germany in the Second World War.
Besides the price of a whole project's missing installation, including crew training, it gets a problem too.
The price reached the incredible 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) — at least 2.2 billion euros first.
Problems that accumulate with new fregates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's marine strength is decreasing.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartells, Head of the Chamber of Defence in the German Parliament, stated that the WMF "has less ships capable of military missions".
He said the problem was sometimes increasing, because the old ships are listing up and there are no ships to replace.
He complained that none of the fregates of the class of Baden-Wuerttemberg could join the VMF.
The national society of guard monuments listened to the secret life of the bats
A new study carried out in the Scotland Hill was aimed at identifying how bats use a landscape to hunt for food.
The scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of the unique moths and help in the future to save these animals.
A study of the scientific community of state monuments in Scotland is carried out by small bats and also by a temporarily longwashed Dabanton bat in the Invert gardens in Wester Ros.
Special write tools will be located in the main places of this area to follow the bats during the season.
Society workers and volunteers will be able to conduct mobile research using manual detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all recording determine the frequency of the bats- -and what they say they're doing.
A habitat map and report will be used to create detailed pictures of the behaviour of these animals in this landhaf.
Rob Duar, the National Nature Conservation Society's adviser, hopes that the results will show what areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will benefit from the creation of habitat sites like meadows, and the maintenance of bat forests and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened with building and Developer work that affects and destroys them.
The wind turbines and lighting can be risks, as well as sticky flies and some chemistry for building materials, which are threatened by domestic coffees.
The said is not at all blind.
However, because of their nightly life the ears of the bats are more sensible than their eyes when the talk is about hunting.
They use complex fusion techniques to identify bugs and obstacles in flight.
A nationwide society responsible for over 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is very seriously treated by bats.
It has ten trained experts working on it that regularly carry out research, checking places of survival, and occasionally rescue interventions.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish monster in the Truck January in Dumpfries and Hollywood, where there are eight of the ten species of Scotland bats.
The magnificent manager David Thompson says it's a perfect area for bats.
"Here, in Triv, we have just a great place for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, and a very good place to live.
But we don't know a lot about bats, so our work here and in other gents can help us understand that they need better life."
He stresses the importance of checking on the presence of bats before performing the repair of property, as one can relentlessly destroy one of the plants by killing up to 400 females and the young bats, which will result in complete destruction of the local population.
Bearers are under protection and are forbidden to kill, frighten, disturb or destroy their nurses.
Elizabeth Feral, of the Organization's worker on guardian bats in Scotland, called upon the public to help in this case.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many species we don't even know how live their population."
The Ранald charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to fall to court on German magazine
Kristian Ranald called his accusation of rape by "Fale News" saying that people want to "recommend themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to submit to the court at the German magazine Der Spiegel, who published the charges.
The Forward of the Coast-Based Partnership and Juventus there was accusation of raping Catherine Mayorg's Americans in the Los Vegas Attel room in 2009.
Then he ніби paid her $375,000 for her silence, wrote on Friday to Der Spiegel.
Instagram Live, a 33-year-old Ronald video, addressed 142 million subscribers a few hours after the publication of the accusations, calling it "Fay News".
"No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are stories," stated the five-year-old owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
"They want to make an advertisement in my name.
It's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name but this is a part of my work.
I am happy and kind," he added with a grin.
Lawyers Ronald prepare a case before a court against the magazine Der Spiegel on the question of allegations which called the “inadmissible report of suspicions in a private case”, announces the Reuters Agency.
Advocate Christian Scherz stated that the player would demand redress for a “moral damage in a sum which matches the difficulties of rights abuses, and it might have been the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years."
It's like there's an incident happening in June 2009 in the Los Vegas lux attel Hall Hall and Cassinov room.
Meet the night club of the Ranald and Mayorha as if they had returned to the room hammer, where he purported to rapt it anonically, as written in the documents of the District Court of the Clark District in the state of Nevada.
Majors argues that after that Rangalda occulted and said that he's a “99 percent good guy” who suffers from“one percent”.
And in the documents it says that Randalda admitted they had sex, but they agreed on it.
Myorgo also states that he went to the police and took injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an outsourcing settlement because "very scared of vengeance" and she was concerned that she was "publicly taken."
A 34-year-old woman says that she wants to rebuild the blame because she feels morally hurt for that incident.
In the meantime, as if the case of Rangald was about to go to Madrid's Real with the Manchester Youytid, and this summer it moved to Italian "Juventus" closing the deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain "always spares" losses of car builders
The Great Britain “always regrets” the loss of its status as world leader after Brexita, as the Minister for Business, Greg Clark, said.
He adds that his Toyota UK statement for BBC is that if Britain leaves the EU without consent, the company temporarily reduces production at a factory in Bernoston, near Derby half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer stated that the impact of delay on the boundary as a result of Braxita without consent could lead to reduction of jobs.
Bernaston envelope--where Toyota Auris and Avenis is being made--has last year produced nearly 150,000 cars, of which 90 percent were exported to other European countries.
"I think when Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, the production on our factory stops," said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernoston.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom raised the question of how would a transboundary trade be carried out if Britain would withdraw from the EU without agreement.
BMW, for example, declares that it closes its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
It's fundamentally disturbing that car builders talk about the risk of posting chains as the result of Brenxit without agreement.
The Toyota derivative line works on "due in a term" when spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the Ukrainian and the EU for ordered cars.
If East Britain leaves the EU on March 29 without agreement, there can be a breakthrough on the boundary which lead to delays and shortcomings of parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep at the Derby factory more than the day's spare parts, stated the campaign so the production would stop.
Mr. Clark said that Teresa Maye's Plan Chakers on future relations with the EU was “made precisely to avoid these checks on the borders”.
"We need a deal. We want to get the best agreement not only that will make us use this feature today," he said in the BBC Radio 4 program.
"The information that we get from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers indicates that we have to be able to continue the successful delivery chains."
The Toyota company couldn't tell how long production won't work, but it was warned that the cost added to reduce the competitiveness of the factory and would reduce the jobs.
Peter Tzalarys, who works in Bernoston for 24 years and is a union coordinator, said, "The union is very concerned, because in my experience, when the workplaces are short, they're not going to be renewed anymore.
The secretary of the government said, "We have offered a precise plan of our future relationship with the EU that deserves trust."
The White House declares that a Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be deferred again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and the Assistant General Prosecutor Rodham Rosenstein's can be “made for a week” while the fight around the candidate to the Bret Cavano Hill Court announced on a Sunday representative of the White House.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser, Robert Muler, who studys the interference of Russia, the trump assistants' liaison with Russia, and the potential barrier to justice by the President.
Release the Temple of the assistant general prosecutor or not, and thus put under the threat of Muler's independence, for months by leaking oil into the dynggton fire.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of taking the hidden microphone to record Trump conversations and the possibility of stepping up his president with 25 prescriptions.
Rosenstein just took over that.
But in last Monday he went to the White House among the rumors about what was going to fall into retirement.
Instead of this it was announced that on Thursday there would be a meeting with the Trump, which at the time was located at the headquarters of the AAN in New York.
The trump said that he wouldn't want to drop out of Rosenstein, but then the meeting was scheduled to avoid encountering in the legal committee of the Senate where there was a Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Cristina Blace Ford.
On Friday, the Trump ordered a week's investigation by the FBI of statements against the Kavano, which was even more slow to vote in the Senate.
The press secretary of the Trump Sarah Sanders appeared in a Sunday Fox News program.
When she was asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "Although it is not intended maybe this week, it's probably next, and I believe it's rather a week later, taking into account all the other things that have a place in the Superior Court.
"But everything will happen, and I always give the press the new information."
Some journalists are willing to challenge her whistle: Sanders hasn't held a briffan for the White House press since 10 September.
Leading program Chris Wallas asked her why.
Sanders said that the rareness of the briffins was not a matter of contempt to the television broadcasters, but she added, "I agree with the fact that they work on the public."
Then she said that the boundless contact of the tram and the press would increase.
"The President has met more press answers than any president who has been to him," she said, adding without specific facts, "We have studied these figures."
The British are happening and Sanders reported, but "when the press has the chance of directly asking questions to the President of the United States, it's much better than doing it through me.
We're trying to do this a lot, you've seen how we've been doing this over the last few weeks, and such a meeting that you can ask a question directly to the President will replace briffins."
The tram is regularly answering questions when she leaves the White House or takes part in a street meeting, or a press conference with high foreign guests.
The press conference itself of the President was rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated why, when free and sometimes extravagantly appeared before the reporters.
The minister of health wrote to the EU employees in the health system of the Scotland before Brenxit
The Ministry of Health wrote to the EC employees who work on the Scotland health system to express gratitude on behalf of the country and wish them to stay after Brenxit.
Jan Freeman sent a letter less than half a year before Easter from the EU.
The Scotland government is already ready to cover the cost of claiming for residency from EU citizens working in state services of the country.
In her letter, Mistress Friman wrote, "The Lata continued the negotiations between the Great Britain and the EU on our exit.
But the British government also set up preparations for the script without agreement.
I know that for all of you it's a very restless time.
So I want to remind you of the value of every worker's contribution, regardless of his nationality.
My colleagues from all over the EU, and not only do they give valuable experiences and skills that enhance and perfect the work of health services, they also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your house and we really want you to stay with us."
Cristio Abercromebi carried over an urgent operation after the injuries of his head
Linbecker of Tennessee State Tigers Cristion Abercromebie transferred an urgent operation after he got a trauma head in a Sunday match that his team played 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores, reports by Mike Authority with Tennessee.
Chief Tennessee State Rod Reed told the reporter that the injured player had got shortly before he interrupted.
"He went onto a side line and suddenly fell down," said the Red.
The terrain and the honeybee have given Abercombe the asslord is still on the field before putting it on the seeds and shipping to plant the diagnosis.
The Tennessee professor of State said to Cris Harris from a radio station called WSMV in Neshvili, Tennessee, that Abercromebie was operated in the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris adds that there's no "professional about the травs" and Tennessee's state is trying to detect if the player got a injuries.
Abercombie, a friend-sportsman, spends the first season in Tennessee of the state after going from Ilinos.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five full intercepts, which gives only 18 intercepts for the season.
Foreign buyers of the British Treasury will pay a large parlor
Conscious of the new plan of conservator foreign buyers of British estate will pay a higher ship, and an extra money will go to help homeless
This action neutralizes the successful initiative of the Corbin upon attraction of young electors
The increase of the public mail will fall upon those who fail to pay the taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance intends to get up to 120 million pounds a year for help homeless
Today, Teresa May promise that foreign buyers of British estate will pay a higher public mail and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's initiation after young electors are attracted and affordable housing. It's directed at high-income people.
The acceleration of public mails is directed towards persons and firms that don't pay taxes in the UK, when they get money to go to government housing programs with homeless people.
The increase in the present public mail, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, in buying other homes and housing for employment, can amount to three percent.
A Ministry of Finance hopes to get up to 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of newcomers in London buying non-residents of Great Britain. And it leads to higher prices, and it makes it hard for new buyers to buy their first shelter.
Many rich regions of the country, especially the capital, have become “cities-priduced”, because the large number of purchasers abroad live most of their time not in Britain.
The new policy appeared literally a few weeks after Barris Johnson called out to reduce the public mail for young buyers to make it easier to get to the first place.
He accused large construction firms of holding high prices of immobility by taking over the land and the excellence of it, and called on Mistress May to cancel quotas on accessible housing to direct the “government status” of Britannica.
Mr. Corbin announced a loud series of housing reforms, including control of the rent and stopping the “distinguished” extinguishment.
And he also wants to convey to the local council more powers as to the construction of dwellings.
Mistress May said, " last year I said I'm going to have a job as Prime Minister in the U.K. renewal of the U.S. dream -- life for each new generation must be better.
This means improving our imperfect market of housing.
The British will always be open to those who want to live here, work, and build their lives.
However, it is not fair that persons who do not reside in the UK and foreign companies can buy immobility also easily as workers in Britain.
For too many people, the dream of having a house becomes more and more insane and the problem of homeless remains very real."
Jack Ros: "My main ambition is to manage a Scotland assembly."
Jack Ross, a trader in Sanderland, said that his main ambition was ever going to be a training officer in the Scotland assembly.
The 42-year-old Scotch performs the task of restoring a club from the north-east, which is now on the third place of the First League, in three points from the first.
He moved to work in the summer after he brought Saint Merene back to the Scotland Prime League last season.
"I wanted to stand up for my country as a player.
But it failed," said Ross in transfer BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up, often sick of Scotland at the Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me go back.
But that will happen when I am a successful club coach."
Among the previous Ross in the Sanderland coach, Dick Advoct, David Mys, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Keen, Gus Poyé and Paula Di Qanya.
A former coach named Aloa Atletic says he was unwittingly afraid of such famous names in such a big club, prejecting the offers from Barnsley and the "Ipswich Town".
"Now by success for me will the answer to the question "Could I turn that club to Premier League?"
According to the structure and material base of the club his place is probably Premier League," he said.
"Not just return it there, but I'll count my work as successful only if I can get back there club."
Ross is only three years of training, and he's been a coach assistant in Dombardon, and for 15 months he's been at Harts training headquarters.
And then he was helping Aloa return from the third League and turned Senn-Miren from a loser who had almost hit Chempianchip at the winner of the next season.
Ross says that it's more comfortable now than it was during his Claid career, the Hartlepool, the Falkirk, the Saint-Miren and the Hamilton Academicol.
Reminding the work at 'Aloa', he said, 'It was a really important choice.'
"I really believed that a coach work is that I need more than a game.
It sounds incredible, because I worked well, I earned enough, and I achieved certain heights.
But the game can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to do every week.
I'm going through this now when you talk about stress and pressure, but you need training.
I always wanted to train and now I do it, and for me that's the right time of my adult life."

According to the study of perfect time to drink pint beer - 17:30 on the Sabbath
A rocking summer raised British strikes that struggle for survival, but brought pressure on restaurants' networks.
According to BC statistics, sales grew by 2.7 percent in sticks, but in restaurants the sales volume fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA Consultation Business Group, who collected this statistics, said, "The extended sun weather and longer than expected, the English assembled for the Championship World means that in the sticking case, what was happening in June when the toilet trade increased by 2.8 percent, and here the restaurants suffered even more.
Lower sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June was just worse in stickers.
Domestic pubs and bars that basically sell drinks until shown the best outcome to be unlike restaurants.
A probe that sells more food, either bite at the sun or even less so badly as restaurants.
It looks like people just wanted to drink.
In pitches and bars of food sales grew by 6.6 percent, and the sale of food declined by 3 percent."
Paul Nouman, a RSM analyst for rest and placement, said, "This is what results from a training that we see from the end of April.
We have the most important factors on the weather, and the influence of social and sporting events, when it's about sales on the public food market.
And no wonder restaurants are still fighting because sales dropped by 4.8 percent a year and that's really unpleasant when prices keep growing.
The long and hot summer came at the pokyest time for the operators, who are focused on food, and time will show, or the lower temperatures in August will bring such an unexpected relief."
The total growth of sales in belts and restaurants, including recently discovered, was made up in linear 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in the deployment of brands.
A tool to track sales in British beaches, bars and restaurants Coffer Peach Tracker collects and analyses productivity data from 47 active groups that have a total abnormalities of 9 billion pounds, and is an important source of that branch.
Each fifth child has a secret account in a social network which it hides from the parent
The study showed that every fifth child--something filled only 11-- has secret accounts in social networks that it hides from parents and teachers
Study 20,000 high school students showed the growth of excellence Insta pages
It's a news confounded fears that they publish sexual content there
Twenty percent of the students said that they had a "basic" account showing the parents
Each fifth child, just 11 years old, creates an account in a social network that keeps in secret from his parents.
Instagram, 20,000 secondary school students have found a rapid growth in excellence in Insta accounts - as if to lead them to an Instagram image exchange website.
It's a news that's congested by the fears that sexual content is published there.
Twelve percent of students said that clean "private" accounts are kept to show their parents and also their private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter, found out that she had summoned others to rape me.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the HMC independent school directories revealed that 40 percent of teenagers from 11 to 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had secret accounts.
Chapter HMC Mike Bükenan said, "It's very disturbing that so many teenagers want to create a place on the Internet where neither parents nor teachers will find them."
Eulid Doyle will be the "holas of Sportsmen" in the Scotland Sauce of Easy Athletics
Alied Doyle was identified as an observer for the annual meeting of that organ in Scotland.
Doyle, the most promulgated Scotland Scotland Sport and President Ian Bitty, described this event as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from its experience at a variety of levels, including the international experience over the past decade.
"Aelid is a great respect for Scotland, the Great Britain and the World Sport Community, and we are sure that the easy Atlantic in Scotland is getting a lot of useful work from her sawat," said Bithi.
Doyle said, "I want to act as the voice of sportsmen, and I hope I can help manage sports in Scotland."

The adventure of the small pump where mothers compare with cows divided the opinion on the internet
The small pump production campaign shared the assumptions by releaseing an ad that compares nursing women with cows.
To mark the launch of what is called the world's "first donated small pump," a consumer company, Elvie released an ironic music advertisement based on video to show the freedom this device gives to nurses.
Four real mothers dance in a pirate with cows under the song, where there are these words, "Yes, I give myself, but I don't have my tail" and, "For example, if you haven't noticed, it's not waving, it's my breast."
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm feeding kids, dai, dai, I give my women."
However, the advertisement which was placed on a Facebook page caused a hot debate on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments; the reaction to the video was mixed -- many people talked about it being the horror of small production.
"A very bad decision to use cows to advertise that production.
Like us, they must be engaged and born to give the milk, that's their children's only picking up in a few days," wrote one viewer.
Elvie small pump is intactly hided in feeding buffers (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment was: "It all came in traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them for the little pump advertisement for mothers who don't take away children?"
Someone said, "Such an unprecedented ad."
Others were advertising an ad, and one woman wrote that they should count the song as being "forgotten."
"I think that's a genius idea.
And I'd like to have that if I'm feeding my breast.
Resumption of milk makes me feel corvious.
It's a bit crazy, but I liked it.
This is a wonderful product," she wrote.
And there's another comment, "Very funny advertising directed at mothers that suck up their milk pumps (only in the workplace or in the tunnel) and they hear themselves "colored."
It is an advertising nonsense and condemns small industry."
In the end of the video a group of women showed that they were all dancing with the invisible little pumps hidden in the bulb.
The concept of the advertising company is based on the fact that many women who use small pumps feel like cows.
But Elvie Pump pump pump is absolutely obsolete, doesn't have wires or tubes and is insanely hiding to feeding women, giving women freedom of movement, allowing them to keep up, and even get out of the house during the work of the device.
Ana Balanin, a partner and creative director of the company, Mother noticed, "Elvie Pump is so revolutionary that it deserves distinct and proactive launch.
We've wanted to pay attention to the repulsion of the milk and its difficulties, while demonstrating in a funny and good-natured way how the new little pump would bring about extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's already, for the first time, Elvie's small pump is getting into focus.
During the London week's mother's fashion, two children came up on a pillow in the clothes of Martha Yakubowski, using that product.
Hundreds of immigrant children without excessive noise moved into a tent camp on the Thai border
Although the number of crossings a month has almost changed, the number of detained immigrant children has sharply increased, partly because of that number are employed by a cruel rhythoric and politician under the Trump administration, who have stigmatized the placement of children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most suspicors are immigrants-non-legals who fear to put under threat their own stay in the country by taking responsibility for the child.
The risk was increased substantially in June when the federal authorities announced that a potential sugar dad and other full-year-old household members would need to give fingerprints and give them to the immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Olbens, a high-level Immigration and Privacy Officer, addressed the Congress with a report of arrests by dozens of people requesting to spy out on minors without authorization.
Later on, in the light, it was reported that 70 percent of the arrested people had no convictions before.
"About 80 percent of those who are sugar sugarists or members of their households are illegal in the country, and a significant part of them is foreigners in the criminal past.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Olbens.
In order to speed up the processing of children, the employees have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court for a month after the date of incarceration, and so on, according to the shelter workers, it was the standard 60 days before the standard term.
Many people will have to use videos to present statements of their own status as an immigrant judge instead of being in court personally.
People who don't think of anything to do to help are quickly deported.
According to workers, as shelters and messages from sources on the system that have emerged over the last months, the longer children are being released, the greater the likelihood of getting depressed, or increasing disturbances which can result in explosions of violence or attempts to escape.
Counsels claim that in more large institutions, such as Tornila, these problems are much stronger, as signs that a child is in a mountain condition, will most likely be ignored because of the size of the establishment.
They add that moving children to a town of myths without providing emotional preparations or a greeting with friends might worsen the injuries that many of them have already encountered.
Syria requires the immediate withdrawal of the U.S., France and Turkey
In a conflict between the United Nations General Assembly and the Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Muallem, he also called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the war that continues in the eighth year.
A mual, which is also the Prime Minister's Vice-Chairperson, stated that the foreign forces on the Syrian soil are illegal, against terror, and "they will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must leave immediately and place no conditions," he said at the Assembly meeting.
Mualem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to throw their homes, “the war on terror is practically over.”
He reported that Damascus intends to continue “to wage this holy battle until we clear all the Syrian territories” from both theoristic groups and“any illegal foreign presence”.
In Syria there are about 2,000 U.S. warriors who are basically performing the role of Kurdish and Syrian forces and advisers in the fight against Bashara Asada President.
France's land continent in this destroyed war country is over 1,000 military personnel.
On the question of refugees Mualem stated that conditions for return were conducive and accused of “some Western countries” in the “encircumstance of irrational fears”, containing foreign refugees.
"We call upon an international community and humanitarian organizations to assist their return," he says.
"They politicize the exclusively humanitarian question."
The United States and the European Union are warned that Syria will not be assisted in restoring until a political agreement on the end of war is reached between the Union and the opposition.
Diploma AAN reports that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey about the creation of a buffer zone in the last large opposite of rebels by Idlibe created the possibility to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-tour agreement prevented the wider attack of Syrian forces supporting Russia to the province where there are three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “precise terms” and hoped that military actions would be directed against jihadists, including militiaists, with Al-Qaida-related fronts of Nusr, which would “have to be destroyed”.
Ambassador AN AN Stan de Missiona hopes to pinch the first meetings of the new committee in the coming days, including representatives of government and opposition, in order to develop a subsequent constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.
Mualem expressions of participation by the Syrian government in the committee stating that the commission's work should be limited to "the examination of articles of the existing constitution" and a precaution against interference.
Why the tram will go another term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump is winning in 2020 elections when, as many Liberian viewers hope, impistence, and the scandal of deadlines will not complete his presidency.
And that, no doubt, would be "The Dramatic Final of the Presidency of the Whole History!"
At this point there is no sign of the weariness of the spectators.
Since 2014, ratings have grown more than twice as much -- up to 1.05 million to CNN and almost three times -- up to 1.6 million to MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News, an average 2.4 million spectacles working in private, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show communication collected 3.5 million spectacles by the screen and crossed the ratings of cable television in the evenings when the top news was given.
"This is a fire people are тягing to, because we don't understand it," says Nile Ber, director of the Drama ABC, who is a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes a president after a attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nellie Skovell, the cassette scripter's comedy and authors of the book The Para funny detail and a few hard truths about penetrating the Hollywood boy club, "There is another theory.
She mentions the trip to a taxi in Boston before elections in 2016.
The driver told her that would vote for Mr. Trump.
- Why?--she asked.
He answered, "Because he has fun with me," said Miss Skowell.
Chос is precious still and what can amuse.
Of course, as opposed to all the rest of TV, the street lines that come out of Washington can become as significant as the Route versus Weida's, depend on whether it will allow the families of immigrants to reunite and health of the world economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that can only afford the most privileged spectacles.
And yet, when you observe the sixth hour's group of experts discussing the use of Bob Vudouderdad 's non-printing information in the book Strach, the Pol Manofort jacket for 15,000 dollars with ostrich skins (proceedings of pride written in The Washington Post) and the consequences of the sharp descriptions by St. Daniels, hm, Mr. Trump anatomy, it goes beyond the simple scope of the desire to be informed of matters.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario just as before.
"The period of what he is doing makes you feel as if you're looking at the realist show he's showing every evening," says Brent Montgomery, performing the director, "Wheelhouse Entertainment," and the author of "Pawn Stars" and "Stars like Pedestrians," about the changing actor show of the Trump and the constant turns of a story.
You can't afford to skip even one episode, or get back back from the train.
When I spoke to Mr. Flaces this week, behind the windows of his house on the north shore of Cauai stood a hot sunday and 30 degrees warming; but he sat inside and stared MSNBC while writing CNN.
He couldn't fail, not when Brett Kavan was brought before the Court Committee of the Senate, discussing the future of the Supreme Court, which was hanging in the shelf.
"I remember the grandchildren when we were выпускing these crazy show, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,'" said Mr. Flace.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be right."

External cash flows form part of the rigid pre-election race for the intermediate election to the House of Representatives
It's not surprising that the 17th election district of Pennsylvania has been covered with a money-generating bond due to a change in the district boundaries that Congress entered, and that the two candidates take part in the elections in one place.
Recently, the vicinity district of Pitzburg is surrounded by democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Conar Lamba who won his seat in another district in the past spring.
Lemb stands against another existing deputy, Republican of Keith Rotfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is essentially consistent with the new 17th.
The maps were replenished after the Pennsylvania Superior Court of Justice in the January that the voices of the old districts were inconsistently credited in favour of the Republicans.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district caused the downfall in the financing of the company financial groups of the major parties, the Chamber of Congress of the Democratic Company (KDC) and the National Communities of the Republic Company (NCRC).
The Lamb became renowned in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the 18th district of Pennsylvania in March.
That place has been occupied by a Republicer for over ten years, and President Donald Trump has won in a 20-point environment.
Political experts find it a small advantage for democracy.
The U.S. judged El Salvador's possibility of punishing for supporting China, and then retreated
The dramas noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already supported the position of Beijing in spite of the slight opposition of Washington.
Mister Trump met warmly with President Mr. Huanam Carlass Varel in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners hung the Trump leadership team.
Member States' professors of State Department decided to resolute the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with the “ancient decisions about Taiwan's misconceptions”, stated the press secretary-general of Heather Naurt in the beginning of this month.
However, practitioners were only dealt with in relation to El Salvador, which received about $140 million of American aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
Sanctions that include financial aid reduction and targeted visa limitations would be painful for the Central America country with its high level of unemployment and killings.
In order to complete the internal meetings, representatives of the North and Central America set aside the holding of a conference at a high level devoted to security and economic prosperity, which would be the length of the similar meeting last year, which was considered a step in efforts to prevent immunization to the United States.
But to the middle of September, high-level officials of the Administration gave the impression that they wanted the conference to take place and actually stopped the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to the diplomats, the Vice President, Mike Penny, will speak to a conference that is scheduled for the middle of October, as a sign that the administration is performing an event.
And the three U.S. messengers returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further severe messages or punishments from Washington.
Professor of the White House, Mr. Boltan, refused to comment on the debates that were described by three American officials, including two diplomatics, who agreed to discuss the internal issues while maintaining an anonymity.
Their messages are confirmed to others close to the administration- -that analysts also wanted to remain anonymous.
Study History
The next step could be a report of the Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice, about an example of which at present there are very heavy evidence in public nature documents.
It is reported that Mr. Muler has focused on the investigation on the possibility of conspiracy to the Trump and Russia companies coming to elections.
When Congress change the landlord, Mr. Trump will stumble in front of the face of responsibility before these organs, just as he prepares to speak again before the voters, and perhaps in the end, before the jury with the number of his colleagues.
There is a lot of "when," and I don't mean to say that the fall of Mr. Trump is imminent, as is his like in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, have to make a choice that determines how long the struggle will go.
In 1938, German officers were ready for the State Revolution against Hitler if only the West did resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
And we've failed, and we've missed the possibility of avoiding the next years of bloodshed.
The story is twisted around similar fractures, and the infinite march of democracy is accelerating or postponed.
Right now the Americans encountered a few of these broken moments.
What happens when Mr. Trump dismisses the Vice-President of General Prosecutor Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muler's investigation?
Rosenstein found himself in trouble since he wrote about last year 'cause he offered to secretly write down his presidential words and think about his proficiency.
Mr. Rosenstein says the passage "The Times" is not exact.
"How will we react when the newly requested FBI investigation of the case of Bret Kavan is not all-abundance or fair, or if it is confirmed in the Superior Court despite the trustworthy accusation of sexual assault and the incomprehensible testimony?
And above all, shall we vote in elections for Congress, which will attract Mr. Trumpa to responsibility?
If we don't make these trials, democracy will take a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson that I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslav Jewish citizen who deported to Asvenz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my parole house.
She survived, emulated to America, and 60 years later she sent me out to light up the Saturday candles on that table with his pistol.
And a legacy like me, how can I not be a optimist in relation to our future?"

Graham Dorance of Reinjeers is optimistic about the next day's "Rapide Vienna" match
Reinhers takes the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that it has won over the Austrians after an impressive nothing in Spain over Villereal this month will allow them to leave the G League of Europe assuredly outside the group.
Trauma knees prevented Graham Dorans, for the first time in the season, from speaking to nothing by 2-2 with the William, but he thinks that Raingers can take this result as a tamplin.
“It was a significant match for us, because William is a strong adversary,” thinks a 31-year-old fupolist.
“We started playing the game thinking we could get something and a little glass did.
Perhaps at the end we could kill the ball, but on a whole night too we became a good outcome.
They looked better in the first time, but the second time we had taken ourselves together, and we had the best half the field.
One more significant night on Thursday is going to happen for European football.
So hopefully we can earn three points, but that's going to be a hard game, because they showed the good results in the last game, but given the crowd of speakers in the stands, I'm sure we can manage them and show you a good game.
Last year was determined to be difficult, both for my injuries and for the changes in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good, and boys are actually enjoying the game; training is productive.
I hope we can move forward, cross the last season and achieve success."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retired generations
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a definite idea of what they wanted to care for themselves, few of them spoke about it with their families.
About half of the people who were involved in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but do not take steps to discuss it," says Holly Snaider, vice-president nationwide on life insurance.
And that's where we start.
Talk to your husband and children about this: Your family will not be ready to help you if you don't prejudge your wishes.
Do work with the consultant and the family and discuss where and how to get medical help, because this might become an important factor in determining the cost.
Suppose you discuss the financial consultant, and he can help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your financing choice for long-term care may include traditional insurance policy for long-term care, hybrid life insurance policy that helps cover these costs or you can insure your life yourself - provided you have money.
Solve case of legal documents: foresee the judicial battalions.
Receive trust in medical services to assign a trusted person to control your health services and to ensure that your medical services are executed if you are not able to talk.
Also, consider a possibility of using financial controls.
Assign a trusted person to make a financial decision and provide a payment of your accounts if you are incapable.
And don't forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical help, and he's on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions of prohibited drugs and allergies?
Lock these details in writing to be ready.
"Do not just have a role in financial matters, but also in doctoral professionalism," adds Martin.
"Which medicines will be required?
Who will take care of the dog?
I have to schedule everything."
In Iльфramba in her husband had shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man got some patting with the pneumatic rifle as he walked home at night.
Forty years old, I was in Oxford Grove, Ilfrakomba, Devon, when he was shot down in his chest, his belly and his hand.
Police officers described the arrow that took place at about 2:30 p.m. at the local time as "an accident".
The affected did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not a threat to life, the police ask for witnesses to contact them.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
According to official individuals, at least 384 people have died as a result of a mighty earthquake and tsunami that collapsed into the Indian city of Paulo in the Friday, and it's expected that the number of deaths were killed by an Israelite.
Because of connections between humanitarian actors, they couldn't get any information from the Dongal, a district north of Pala, which is nearer to the 7.5-a-point earthquake epicenter.
In Palu more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after a static disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Pala and Dongal on the Sulaves Island:
Paulo is a capital of the province of the Central Sulaves located at the end of the narrow covet on the western coast of the Sulaves Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 for 2017.
When earthquake and tsunami came, they celebrated the 40th anniversary of founding.
Dongala is a regeneration that stretches by more than 180 miles (300 km) of the coastline in the northwest of the Sulaves.
The Registry was the administrative unit below the province, and in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation for the economy of the province of the Central Union, especially the Dongal coastal region.
The nickel mining also matters to the province, but the main focus is on Morala, on the opposite coast of the Sulaves.
In a number of times Palo and Dongal have been hit by tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938, hundreds of homes were demolished in Dongala with a tsunami of over 200 people.
Also, the tsunami hit the western part of Dongal in 1996, which resulted in nine deaths.
Indonesia is in the Seismic-activative Pacific quilt, and it is regularly rocking earthquakes.
A lower list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Ochech in the north of Sumatra on the 26th of the tsunami caused by 14 countries, resulting in the deaths of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the Hazech.
2005: The Series of Strong Earthquakes ended at the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March-beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, at the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The magnetic earthquake of 6.8 occurred on the south of the Yava, the most populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis that collapsed into the southern coast, resulting in some 700 deaths.
2009: In the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra Province, there was a 7.6-pound earthquake.
Over 1,100 people have died.
2010: The earthquake of 7.5 points occurred on one of the mainland islands outside of Sumatra, causing tsunamis to raise up to 10 metres [10 m] that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake crashed into the Registry of Posie Jaya in the province of Acheh by causing destruction and panic, as people he reminded of the ruins as a result of the 2004 fatal earthquake and the tsunami.
It was a time when tsunamis had not arrived, but more than 100 people had died under ruins of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes turned round on the tourist island of Indonesia Lambock, which resulted in over 500 deaths, mostly on the north of the island.
The Earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists alone to leave.

Federal curfew requires seldom deadly sentence for suspected in the terrace of New York
The federal curfew in New York is being carried out by the death penalty for Siful Saipov, suspected in the Territory in New York, which resulted in the death of eight persons, a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipus, for 30 years, in October allegedly took advantage of the appreciative roll of the truck entitled "Home Depot" to travel to the Welfare Road along the chessel West West Lake in Lower Manhaten, beating pedestrians and hanging-peeders on his way.
To justify the death penalty, on the basis of an attempt to achieve the death penalty brought into the South New York District, the prosecutors must prove that Saip “intentionally” has beaten eight persons and “intentionally” suffered serious bodily harm.
According to the materials of the court, both offences can be punished as a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the great federal investigation of the jury is Ashalamil Saiva by announcing the 22-point charges that included eight charges of murder to support the reception; this item is usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as charges of rape and destruction of transportation.
According to the prosecutors, the attack required “continue and deliberate planning”, and describing the Saip crimes committed, used phrases such as“normal, cruel and dissolved”.
“Sibulah Habibulaevite Saipov has caused injuries, damaged and lost family and friends, Diego Enrique Andrélini, Nicalas Clewes, Anna Lore Decadt, Darren Dreik, Arian Erliya, Ernana Feruch, Ernana Diego Mendas and Alejandra Damian Pagnuk”, reports in intentions.
The five dead were the Argentine tourists.
Since the last revelation of a criminal case with a measure of punishment as a death penalty in the South district of New York has passed for ten years.
Respondent Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug providers, but in the end, he was sentenced to a life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the federal death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs, a married couple punished after they had been sentenced to two years earlier for a conspiracy aimed at spying in favour of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenberg pair was punished with an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipa, an evacuator from Uzbekistan, according to judicial documents, demonstrated the absence of conscientious remorse in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he declared investigating that feeling a satisfaction from his kidney.
Upon accusation, Saipov reported to the authorities that he was inspired to attack the Islamic State video on the phone.
Also, he asked permission to hang the flag of the Islamic state in the hospital palace, informed the police.
He doesn't recognize himself guilty of a blame- -that's 22 points up.
David Paton, one of the federal social defenders representing Saipau, said that they were “unconfidentically disappointed” by the decision of the procurator.
"We believe that the decision of applying death penalty, not life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only extend the pain of these events to all participants," said Patton.
The Defence Team Saipan had previously asked the prosecutors not to seek death penalty.
A member of the Parliament from Torah says that Nigel Faraj has to lead a negotiations over Brenxit.
Today, during the protest at the Torah Nigel Faraj party conference, he swore "Mabilize the People's Army".
There was a leader in Ukip saying that politicians should "recover the discomfort" from Europeans - as one of the Teresa Parliament's members proposed his candidature for negotiations with the EU.
A parliamentary member from Peter Boun's conservator's party said during the Burmingham march that the United Kingdom would be "out" if Mr. Farage had been in charge of the secretary's office on Brexit.
But the problem with which Mistress May encountered trying to reconcile his varied followers was even worse when Torah, who advocated the preservation of membership in the EU, launched a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The premier is trying to maintain the compromise Cheker's agreement under constant pressure from fans and employees of exit, and also from the EU itself.
Unioners insist that during their attempts, they make a Brussels deal, despite their reactions, and they want to get Europeans and leubarrists to pick up between her package and her biscuit.
Leave Means Leave, which is the way to bring Cheker out of the board.
He suggested that Mr. Farraj made the same and paid off the duties of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have already gone," he said.
A member of Parliament from Wellingborough said, "I'm for Bracet, but we need to step back from Cheker's Plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We didn't lead world wars to be addictionable.
We want to comply with our own laws in our country."
Mr. Boun suggested that public opinion changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea of what the British have changed their opinions and want to stay is totally inconsistent with the reality."
Bracetya and Torah's member, Andrea Jankins was also at the march, and in conversation with the journalists, she said, "I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to people.
"The Cheker Plan is unpopular among the wider audience, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular to our party and activists who actually walk out into the streets and choose us.
Please reject the plan and start listening."
In a sharp turn toward Mistress May, she added, "The prime ministers are staying on the board when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj said that politicians needed to get "discomfort" when they were going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This right now is the question of trust between us--people and politicians," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brace, and we're here today to say to them, "It won't get you out of hand."
In his turn to an excited crowd, he added, "I want you to get those politicians who are willing to betray Brexit will feel discomfort.
“We mobilize the people's army of this country that has given us a victory in Brexis and will never calm down until we become an independent, self-directed, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, however, exit workers went through Burmingham before spending a two-hour rally in the middle of town.
A few activists wore the tories against Brexit (Torie against Brexit) around the banners after starting the group in these outgoing.
The Leibary Perer Lord Adanis met over the conservators due to security problems that they encountered because of a party program to open a conference.
"These are people who tell us that they can be prepared to use the IT system and all technology for Canada plus, for a border without training, for a free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's full throat.
There is no such thing as a good Braxite," he added.
Warren plans to focus attention to the chatting process on the post of President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after elections in November she “will pay close attention to the strife of the President's post”.
"The Boston Globe" reports that a democracy from Massachusetts on Saturday related its future during a general assembly in the western Massachusetts.
Warren, the frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, is going to go to the re-election, and she's opposed to a member of the Republic party, Jeff Dill, who was a senior member of the Maschusec company in 2016.
She was at the centre of discussion as a 2020 tramper's possible successor.
Since the introduction of the Trump to office it has already been the 36th meeting of the general assembly that took place in Khaliok on a Saturday.
One of the people asked if she planned to chatter at the post of the President.
Warren replied that it was time for "the women to go to Washington to govern the broken government, and for that there must be a woman standing at the head."
Orisht occurred after the death of a basketballist Sims from the command of the University of Louisiana
Baton Rouge Police, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that the suspected murder of a basketballist U.S.W. Sims was arrested on Friday.
Baton River Police announced the ambush of 20-year-old Ditan Simpsan during a press conference that took place at 11 a.m. in the east of the morning.
On Friday they published a video shot record requesting to help identify the person who's figures on it.
20-year-old Simus was shot in the morning of Friday near the South University university.
"Wade Sims has received a fiery head wound resulting in his death," stated on Saturday to the journalists of the "247sports" police officer Murphy J. Paul.
Wayd set himself up for a friend and was shot down by Simpsan.
In the course of the interrogation Simpson confessed to being on the crime scene, was armed and shot at Wade Simson.

Gran Pride Russia: Lewis Hemilton approached the champion of the world after he gained a victory over Sebastian Fetell
Since Walter Botas on the Saturday ahead of Luis Hemiltan's qualifications, the orders within the Mercedes teams have come to realize that they play a significant role in the race.
Botas pulled out a good place on the beggar and almost left Hamilton on the will of destiny, till he protected his place at the first two frosts and invited Fetell to attack his friend on the team.
Fetel first went on a pit-stop and left Hamilton to flounder at the end of the total mass of the racers- -that maneuver had to be the decisive one.
The Pilot of the Mercedes came on a circle later and came out behind Fetel, but Hamilton went forward after a few manoeuvres of a circle-in-the-whole that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking to restrain after a double maneuver to escape the third round.
Max Ferstopen, on his 21st birthday, started from a series of rear-lines and to the end of the first circle he had in the seventh place.
Then he led a large part of the race while holding his buses, for he wanted quickly to finish, overrun the Kimi Ricanen and take the fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit-step on the 44th circle, but couldn't increase his velocity on the rest of the eight circles, so Rycanen took a fourth place.
It was a hard day, because Walter's all the weekend spoke fantasticly and expressed himself to the true gentleman if I would be allowed to say that.
"Kamanda has done an extraordinary job to take up the first and second place," commented Hemilton.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump took a ridicule from Senator Dían Winestein on a riting on Saturday because she insisted that it was not the source of the Kristina Blace Ford dump that she accused the candidate of the Bret Kavan Rear Court of Sexual Abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly appeal to the evidence -- the Ford data before the Senate Courtroom -- instead commenting that what happened in Senate showed how people could be “whole, nasty and wrong.”
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's going on in the last few days in the Senate is when you see anger when you see wicked, detestable and lying people," he said.
"When you read about press releases and diversions, then they say, "Oh, I haven't done that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diana Fainstein, is that your leak?
Remember her answer... you lost the document -- "Oh, oh, what?
No, no.
There was nothing from me."
Wait a minute.
We've allowed the fugitive to... no, they haven't allowed," he added, paradigmizing the senator.
Weinstein in linen sent a letter containing details of the prosecutions launched by Ford v. Kavan, and he fled early in September -- but Fainstein denied that the leak had taken place from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't let her history run," said Finstein the committee, reports The Hill.
"She has been asked to keep the story confidential and I'm satisfied with her request."
But she probably didn't like the President who commented so much during her Saturday riting, "That's what I'm going to tell you, it was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
In continuing the candidate's protection to the Superior Court accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President suggested that democracy was using blame for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power to themselves by any means.
You see the flaws and the foulness, and they don't care who they raise, through whom they will have to change to get power and control,” says the president's words, "Mediaite".

A nanny from New York falls to court for a marriage mate for a "racist" message after she quits
A girl from New York goes to court for a married couple for a discriminating dismissal after she got an accidentally sent message from her mother with a complaint that she was "lucky one black."
And then it denys that they're racist, and that they're equal to propriety.
In 2016 Lincy Plaska-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment finding that the new nurse, Jisel Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work.
"NEEEA, THAT ADNA PARNASKURA," wrote Mrs. Plaska-Flaxman in her husband's message.
However, instead of sending it to his husband, she twice sent a message to Miss Morris.
According to New York Post, after experiencing an error, Plasco-Flaxman fired Miss Morris, claiming that the former nurse, who was also an Afro-American, had a bad job attempt, and that she waited instead for her Philippine.
Miss Morris paid the day of work and sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris falls to court for a couple, and he wants to get compensation for his dismissal according to the conditions on which she was initially recruited, although without contract, it's $350 a day for six months to live.
"I want to show them that this is not the right thing to do," she reported, "Post" on Friday. "I know this is discrimination."
And then I gave up the charges of racism, stating that the dismissal of Morris was a reasonable decision considering that they could not trust her afterwards offended her.
"My wife sent her what she shouldn't say.
She's not a spread.
We're not racist,' said Joel Plastka's husband.
"Would you confide in your children back then, with whom you went rough, even by accident?
Your child?
Really?"
Plastically magnificent ass for “powerfulness” and reports that his wife was born just two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
"And will you be persecuting a man in this position?
It's quite fierce," adds a banking investment specialist.
While judicial review continues, public thought quickly condemned a married couple in social networks, exerting high criticism of their behaviour and logic.
Sublington publishers feared that readers would not superuse bears, which Speak, they were spoken in a new sheet
The daughter of Bond Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter, "It is hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it will be published.
It's very fun to read, already knowing about the huge success of Podington."
She explained that her father, who had worked as a BBC operator before he dared to write a book for children about the little vinegar bears, was optimistic despite his non-acceptance of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the editing of books was "horn-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, saying of Polington, whom she described as “a very important member of our family."
"He was a pretty quiet man and didn't altogether shower," she explained.
"But since Podington was so real to him, it was almost a parent's honour for a child who got something: you're proud of them, though it's not really your merit.
I think that he was considering the success of Podington just in such a key.
While it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always gave it to the Padington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to settle down with her on the phone
After she had landed, her daughter was taken to the hospital at Louis Paste 2, where doctors were free to fight for her life.
"There's a regular call to tell you that everything is really bad that it can't bear," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouza.
"Then I rang over to say she would die for the next two minutes and I had to say farewell to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tasy, I love you so much, sweetheart.
I'll soon be with you.
I'll be with you.
The doctors who had given to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She had died a little while ago, and this was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing everything was expanding.
I couldn't groan, I could not shout, I couldn't cry, I had families and people around me.
I should have kept up."
Finally, Mistress Ednon Laperus, who was experiencing the loss of her daughter, sat up at the plane with other passengers -- and they didn't know at all what she had to go through.
"No one knew," she said.
'I bowed my head and on my face all the time flowing tears.
It's hard to explain, but it's really on my way away that I got a sense of faint compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how he loved her."
Wobbly women hang out cards to warn suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones who have committed suicide make every effort to keep people alive.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris put out cards with warm words and phone numbers on which people can get help on the Wales bridge.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he started to depress him, and in 18 he ended his life of suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel as I feel," she said.
Mistress Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydie, said that her son was a talented chef with a contagious smile.
"Everybody knew his smile.
People were saying that his smile would light up any room."
However, before death he threw off the work, for he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was then 11, found the body of his brother when he died.
Mistress Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it might have a nasty consequences."
Mistress Davis created cards so people would know that there are people in the world who you can talk to and talk to, even if that's a friend.
Don't stay in silence; you need to talk."
Mrs. Hasfris, who has been friends for a long time with Mistress Davis, lost Mark, her partner with whom she lived for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was sad, or that he was in depression, or something like that," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude had changed.
On the holiday day he was very oppressed: when the children were opening gifts, he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was for them a great injuries, but it had to live with it, "In the family there was a huge hole.
It's just killing us.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The former Brete Cavano is uncertain, because the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought we could have what he wanted, limited in time and in the investigation round - we can get a bit of a union," said Saturday Mr. Flake, adding that his committee was "drawing away" because he actually got into a strait.
Why do Mr. Kavano and his Republican adherents not want the FBI to carry out the investigation?
Their refusal is sometimes explained.
Currency elections just five weeks later, on 6 November, when, as expected, the republicans will be patient immediately, then they will be relieved in their attempts to select a candidate they need in the upper court.
George Bush called the Senator to fine-tune the support of Mr. Kavano, who was working in the White House during the presidency of Bush and through him acquainted himself with his wife, Ashley, who was then personal secretary, Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishs its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate where 51 republicans and 49 democrats are now sitting.
Until it is clear whether Mr. Kavano would get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow the Vice-President Mike Pensu to resolve the issue of equality of voices and confirm it to the Superior Court.
Number of crosses from the North Korean region fell under the Kima leadership
The number of escapes from North Korea to South fell from the time Kim Cheng Yen came to power seven years ago, announced the South Korean officer.
Park Bo Sun, a sponsor of South Korea's Ministry of Merge, stated that last year there were 1127 races and 2011 was 2706.
Mr. Park said that the main reasons for this are the enhanced border controls between North Korea and China, and the higher costs that have been placed by the fighters for overcrowding.
Phannyang hasn't harnessed it.
Most Northern Korean citizens fugitive over why they get South Korean citizenship.
Seoul states that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most people are running through China, with which the longest limit is in North Korea, more than the DMZ between two very well-demoiled Koreas.
China considers refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and it often causes them to be repatriated.
The relationship between the Pentecost and the Lung - which technical wars are still in - has been greatly improved in recent months.
At the beginning of the month, the leaders of two countries met in Phenyana for denuclearization talks.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States Donald Trump and Kim Cheng Eun Eyn in June in Singapore when they agreed to work as a general term to complete the release of the nuclear weapons of the Korean half-wheel.
But on Saturday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ry Jan Ho accused American sanctions of lack of progress since.
"No trust to the US will be of any confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be going to disarm first," said Mr. Ri in a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Breta Cavano "Article," she says he shouldn't work in the Superior Court.
The leader of the minority in the Nancy Pelozi Palace called the candidate for the Breta Kavano Superior Court “Austeric” and said that he was not suitable for work in the Superior Court at his pace.
Pelosei said this on the Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune edition festival in Austin, Tehas.
"I couldn't give up the thought that if it was a woman who was acting like that, they would call her a hysterical girl," they brought a pelvis of their reaction to the Kavano speech before the Legal Chamber of the Senate in Thursday.
It's been embarrassed to blame for sexual harassment against Dr. Cristina Blaise Ford when they were teenagers.
During his advanced speech, the Kavano was very emotative, and he sometimes shouted, and he couldn't speak when his family and his high school classes were discussing.
And he also clearly accused democracy in the committee calling it accusations against his “gratile and organized murder” organized by liberals, which were angry that Hillary Klinton had lost the Presidential elections in 2016.
Pelogy said she believed that it showed me that he couldn't work in the Superior Court because he showed me clearly that I was biased against democracy.
"I believe he himself has disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and Democrates," she said.
The pelohs said it when they asked her if she would try the caffeine if she was picked up and when democracy would get most of them in the Chamber of Representatives.
"I'll say so, if he doesn't speak the truth in Congres or the FBI, he doesn't just have to work in the Superior Court, but also in the Court where he works now," said Pelos.
Now Kavano is the judge of the District Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that, as a member of a democratic party, she was concerned about the Cavano's potential decision against the law of accessible medicine or that of Raw v. Wade, because the Kavano is a conservative judge.
On hearings on the board, the Kavano didn't answer the questions if he would cancel certain decisions of the Superior Court.
"Now is not the time for hysterical, inadvertent persons to work in court and to wait on us for the words "as wonderful," said Pelos.
And a woman must take it.
It is a justifiable accused speech, months and years of anger just overflowing, and it cannot remember it without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," said Mistress Stein 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's such a rareness."
She went on, "The woman who worked somewhere in the director and who said, what if she was angry was crying, but she did the technique of conduct, and when she was angry and she was crying, she said to the speaker, "Perhaps you think I'm sad because I cry.
But I'm angry."
And I kept talking.
I think it was great."
tears are allowed partly as a way out the sum, because they're absolutely wrong to understand.
One of my most vivid memories of the first work at which I once cried against an unspeakable malice, then a elderly woman grabbed hold of my collar--a restrained boss, who has always scared me a bit--and dragged me up to the stairs.
"Never let you be seen in tears," she said.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think thee sad and will be glad to have you."
Patricia Schrodar, at the time the Congress democracy from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hartham in the Presidential Corporation.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt pitched himself at the maiden's hibernate called Monkey Business and left the president's race, a very angry Mistress Srodor said she could actually participate in a president's company.
"It was not a very well-concerned decision," she said to me 30 years later, laughing at it.
"There were already seven other candidates, and I was no longer required by them.
Someone called this situation "The Seven Dwarves and Seven Dwarves."
Since the company had been going on for quite a while, she didn't have enough tools, so she said she would not take part in the elections if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a bad situation.
It turns out that some of her followers, who sacrificed 1,000 dollars to men, only gave them 250 dollars.
"They're thinking I'm going with the departure?" she thought.
When she stated that she would not participate in a campaign campaign, she was so enthusiastic about emotion -- thanks to people who supported her, to an angry system that made it so difficult to get money and directed to voters, not candidates, and to anger against sexism -- that she caught breath.
"You might think that I've had a nervous breakdown," remembered Mistress Srodor's reaction to the press at her state.
"Maybe I think that my corporate sugar daddy is the producer of paper kleenex.
I used to think they were writing on my superb stones?
"She has cried?"
Why the trade war between China and the US might be good for Beijing
The first fuels of the trade war between China and the United States were terrible, and since the war is far away from ending, in a far-reaching perspective, the misunderstandings between countries can be in favour of Beijing, say the experts.
The President of the United States Donald Trump fired the first warning this year by taxing China's major export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week when the new tariffs involved goods in the sum of 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds) actually taxing half the goods that come to the United States from China.
Every time Beijing responded this way, raising the tariffs recently from five to ten percent per cent on American goods at the cost of $60 billion.
China is a winner in the United States symmetrical response, and the second one of the size of the economy will hardly lead the eye.
To get Washington back back, we have to go deep into the demands, but the public leak in the United States is almost inconvenient for Chinese leader Si Jinpin.
However, experts say that if Beijing uses it correctly, the pressure on trade war in the United States could in a distant way support China by reducing the reciprocal dependency of those two countries.
“The fact that a fast political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will start the process of a sharp economic fall is far more dangerous than the observers thought before,” said Ebigail Grays, a researcher specializing in Asia in the research and analysis centre of the new American security.
Syria “prepared” before the return of the refugees, says the foreign minister
Serbia declares that it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in the reconstruction of a country devastated by war, which lasted for more than seven years.
Turning to the General Assembly of the United Nations Foreign Minister, Walid Al-Mualem, said that the terms in the country were improving.
"This day the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress of the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to update areas that are damaged by the terrors to get back to a normal life.
Now we have all the conditions for returning refugees to the country that they were forced to leave because of the terror and economic measures which were directed to improve their daily lives and livelihoods.
ONE believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six more million people living in the country require humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem stated that the Syrian regime would gladly accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept help for exchange for certain conditions or assistance from countries that spanned rebels.
Europe has won the Reder's Cup in Paris
The European team won the Cube Raidar 2018 by winning the American team with a final number of 16.5 to 10.5 in the Le Golf National in the Paris gulf, France.
The US is already playing six consecutive times on the European land and has not won the Rydar cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe had got a crown even when the Danish Captain's team Thomas Bjorn gained 14.5 points necessary to win the United States.
American star Phil Miquelson, who best struggled for a tournament, put his ball in water by three pairs of the 16th hole by joining the French Malinar match.
The Italian golf player in Malinari played greatly on all rounds, making one of the four players that passed this 5-0-0 field from the current tower in 1979.
American Jordan Speak was beaten with a number of 5 and 4 players with the lowest rating in the European team, Thorn Björn Olsen of Denmark.
The top soup player in the world, Destin Johnson, played 2 and 1, Iena Poulter in England, who probably played in his last cup of Ryder.
Veteran of eight cups of Rydar, Spanish Serhia Garcia, became a player who's mostly winning a career tournament with 25.5 points.
"It's normal I don't cry, but today I can't hold back.
It was a hard year.
I'm a very grateful Tomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad to turn the cup.
The whole business of the team, and I'm glad I can help," said Harry, stirred after the European team defeated.
He handed the estaphet to his countryman, John Ram, who rehearsed the legend of the American Golf of Thaiger Woods on a Sunday in a single match for two inches.
"I'm very proud to have won a job in Tiger Woods, a man who's been watching a child," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all his four wrists in France and now he's got a high number 1321-3 in the Redar cup.
Statistic one of the biggest players ever played 14 titles and staggered at this rating just from Jek Niklaus.
The American team struggled with it except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tni Finau, who were playing high-quality golf throughout the entire tournament.
American Captain Jim Füry said after a disappointing game in defending his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're battlers.
This morning we used to show Europe what we could to do.
We fought.
Take off the hat upon Thomas's honor.
He is a great captain.
All his 12 players were playing very well.
We'll move in, I'll work with the Golf Association and our committee cup of Ryder, and we'll go forward.
I love these 12 guys, and proud I'm their captain.
Take off your hat before them.
We've been played."
