How?
If we knew, we'd probably have corrected it.
But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unity.
I think we have problems with that.

China is strongly opposed to the adoption by the United States of the so-called "Tibay Bill", which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of GOSOVET for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.

TikTok hides bad videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world is more than 500 million, 40% of whom are under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
The TikTok, the Chinese Social Network, censores the video censorship of Tiananman, Tibet’s independence or the banned Falungun religious group, reports The Guardian.
The papers in the publication state that the owner of TikTok (byteDance) by means of the annex promotes Chinese foreign policy objectives abroad.
The majority of violations related to Chinese policy fall under “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok puts unpleasant publications in the context appropriate to the general rules, so that the activities of the social network do not appear to be censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “critical or attacking any country's policies and social rules, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the Tiananman area or genocide in Cambodia is “a distortion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also contains a list of the banned names of twenty “foreign leaders or public figures”, including the Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Jin Yin, the Indian policy of Mahatma Gandi, the American Presidents Donald Tramp and Barak Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, the South Korean President of Park Kin Hy, the Indonesian President, Joco Widodo, and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, referred to in the document.
The forbidden material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and may lead to user locks.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the website, but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
The representatives of the ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and are no longer applied: "Now we use a localized approach for modernization and attract independent local professionals."
The Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publications, says the founder of the Produce Center Rustem Bogdanov.
The Produser Center is one Russian media company that officially collaborates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of the Bloggers of the "Praduser Center" are in line with the social network, but user materials can be posted without agreement, transfers the Bogdans.
To the question of whether TikTok can speak about policy or Putin, Bogdanov is answerable and says that he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaripov agrees with Bogdan: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: you can't put out a shocking content, discriminating statements, and so on."
But under these rules, any content that doesn't like moderators is noted by Zaripes.
The Zaripwa Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world is more than 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
According to a user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Societies ’ administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosite analyses individuals and determines how many years a person looks, tells Bogdans.
If the neurosé decides that the user is younger, its account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBC, ByteDance opened a office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of the kovorking WeWork.

Russians warned of false bank calls
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudulents has increased to replace the bank’s phone number.
This is reported by Commersant 'a reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communication operators with more than 2.5,000 telephone numbers to clients of different financial organizations.
In 189 cases, operators found a substitution.
Another 218 numbers have been blocked and 59 have set a limitation on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Siczev, explained that a number had been replaced by a wide range of Russian banks.
He explained that operators did not always respond to fraudulent phone warnings, referring to the absence of such a duty in the Liaison Act.
At the Opening Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in fraudulent phones with a submenu.
As reported in the Biljan Press Service, part of the fraudulent phones transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the lists contain numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sychev told me that Central Bank was planning to establish a database of fraud numbers to which the communications operator would address each call to verify the number.
He explained that the establishment of such a framework would require amendments to the law.

Barcelona is blackmailing Neimar
The Spanish Barcelona and its ex-footballist Brazilian Naymar are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the attacker came into French Saint-German.
The case almost came to court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Femida.
Otherwise they deny him.
Nymar and his cunning father, who is also a Brazilian agent, have set up an interesting focus: by agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he had to get Euro40 million.
However, literally a year later, the Forward was located in the SPW for a record Euro222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million catalonians and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Badly, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club should also have interest in paying.
When the Neyamar claims were made known in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Grenadines insist that the Bonus was relied on the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player had only a quarter of Euro40 million and required the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But most interestingly, the summer of Naymar and Barsa almost agreed to return the "poor" player to Catalonia.
True, the deal broke out, but the hope of the reverse transition of the Forward remains.
So, according to Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club lawyers told the player's representatives that if the issue of financial claims was not settled pre-trial, this would exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian.
Naymar himself wants to come back so much that he asked the catalonians to buy him back.

Mass riots on three

The evidence of the “mass riots” itself does not hold the tests, but, in the absence of a political decision to dismiss the case at the brakes, a weak proof base would not necessarily result in the removal of the charges.
The breakdown of the case must encourage society, but it is certain that the force forces whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the UK (mass disorders), Alexey Minylo, was unexpectedly released from detention without obligation and was rehabilitated in a few hours later: the SBR withdrew the charges.

Can phytoastrogens and phytoandrogens prolong youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens has been diminished.
Of the most famous are pine dust.
The phytoestrogens are well researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (such as cardiovascular, some cancer).

The Hydrometcenter called the right people's adjectives
In Russia there are many popular perceptions that people try to predict the weather.

As the scientific leader of the Russian Hydrometcenter told Roman Wilfand, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be vigorous, as our ancestors have noted.
And if the sky shines white, then the next day will be rain.
The second adjective is based on bird surveillance.

Unidentified oil spots have been found on the beaches of the northeastern Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches north-east of Brazil.
The contamination scenes were scattered by two thousand kilometres [2,000 km] of the coastline.
Reports of the first petroleum spots have begun on the second September.
However, their number and territorial coverage continued to increase every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out that they are all identical and that it is the crude oil.
In the Petrobras State Petrobras State Corporation, which was transferred to the analysis by the samples found, it stated that they were not in line with the oil extracted from the Brazilian territory.
"It's a thick oil.
It can be dumped from one of the ships after cleaning the reservoirs.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it was in the ocean run," -- told the Brazilian News Portal G1 coordinator of the Pernambuku Petroleum Trade Union and Paraíba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight states affected in the north-east of the country, environmental defenders have discovered nine sea turtles, full of oil films.
And only two of them were saved.
In the near future, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will proceed to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute recommends that tourists and local residents circumvent oil spots by the party and notify of all sites found.

The Russians have nothing to put on retirement.
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentine Mattvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient stockpiles to ensure that the law on a guaranteed pension is fully available in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions from personal accumulation in the world is quite widespread.
Another matter is how timely it is for us to enter it.
"In my view, a large proportion of the population now have income, of which they simply have nothing to devote to increasing pensions in the future," said V. Matthewnko.
In the opinion of the Speaker, the Russians could not understand the mechanisms for the formation and accrual of pensions, since “permanent changes in this area have completely confused them”.
This does not mean that I oppose the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“The Russian Federation is a social State, and we are obliged to do everything in order to make pensions better for citizens' social security.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, in line with domestic realities,” said V. Mattvienko, “RIA Newsty”.
The Head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the law on a secured pension product) was to be developed, several basic principles, including voluntaryity, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and strict guarantees and the State ' s responsibility for securing pension savings, should be established.
The Ministry of Finance of 6 September announced that a bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) had been submitted to the agreement.
Its main elements include the exclusively voluntary order of accession of citizens to the accrual system, the safeguarding of long-term pension stockpiles by the State, the registration of citizens' accumulations by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.

And Faigi reminds me that Sony also creates his own spider-husband movies.
"So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero who was in the different movies.
So while Sony is continuing to develop his own Spady, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five movies, obviously commenting the news, put out in his record at Instagram an excerpt from "Walk with Wall Street" in which Leonardo de Caprio's hero shouts, "I don't go!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.

But that wasn't what Sony did.
The news of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from Marvel's cinema has caused anger on many loyal worshipers.
The details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.

The expert told me why you should give up your tea in the packets.

They don't throw out the wrists at the end of the season, so they can get in the tea.
"More than that, the packets don't always include tea plants," said Tychonova.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink in favor of the tea for the entertainment sold at specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packed tea is not only a composition but also a method of production of the packed tea - micro particles are heating up to high temperatures, which could lead to the release of harmful substances.
"The best way to acquire a clean green tea or a black tea is to be the least added in this drink," said the expert.

Regionals were invited to share the secrets of business support
As the “Parliamentary newspaper” was known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy, Andrew Kotep, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Silwanov, with a suggestion to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation's entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional linkages
The Council of the Federation ' s Economic Policy Committee has compiled information from the regions on the business development and legalization of self-employed and the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the Senators about SME development problems and made proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, communication between regions is not sufficient, as a result of which the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional programmes for the development of entrepreneurship in the country,” said Andrew Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of regional positive developments on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from regional proposals and issues (available).
In addition to the ministries of profile, the regional constituent data are also provided to the heads of the regional executive branch.
The exchange of information on positive development in the regions could lead to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step in this exchange and the communication of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the “Parliamentary newspaper”, the Senator.
Useful experience

A number of other regions have adopted special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed persons continue to be removed from the shadow
In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to existing legislation in order to support small and medium-sized business more effectively.
For example, the Arcangel area proposed that the term “self-employment” be replaced by “business”, since it “is most consistent with the content of the public service to promote the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivan area, it is considered necessary to amend the expansion of the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including the activities related to the segregation and renovation of accommodations, buildings and physical training.
The Bran area considers it important to strengthen the control of unfair producers of milk through the Mercury veterinary system.
In the Kostrom and Magadan areas, the concept of “social entrepreneurship” and the promotion of social entrepreneurship is advocated in the legal and regulatory field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of government programmes for small and medium-sized entrepreneurship, and the most important ones will be developed in the form of specific bills.

The stations to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Government of the RF, it has been estimated that the supply of agricultural and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has been reduced by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report addressed to President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of produce, compared to 3,44.2,000 tons, were imported from the sanction countries in the first half of 2019, against the same period 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
These include the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, the amounts of illicit imports were offset by increased imports from CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that, at the end of August, the Government had extended the rules for the destruction of agricultural production, raw materials and food that had been prohibited from entering Russia through counter-sanctions until 31 December 2020.
In a document posted on the official legal information portal, it was noted that the rule was extended for another one for a year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The initial effect of the sanction destruction order was extended to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, as of 1 January 2016, joined the list.
The decree signed by Putin to destroy illegally “sanctioned” (products under the food embargo, which Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West), entered into force in 2015.

As west sanctions were retained, the FM also prolonged its response.
However, the measure does not extend to products that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption with a weight of up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, President of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, had previously referred to the “simply immoral” destruction of foodstuffs, and he said that this had a negative effect on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, in early June, Rosusenadzor had taken the initiative to prohibit the destruction of foodstuffs suitable for use.
Following that, the Government made a similar recommendation to the Human Rights Council of the President of the RF.
And the vice-premier R.F. Alexey Gordeev said it was wrong to destroy food, and we should think about how we could use it for appointment by assessing the quality.

In Chile, we started building a telescope of Euro1 billion
This is reported by the TACS with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, this week the construction of the building was officially launched, where the E-ELT telescope would be located, while the most expensive and ambitious land astronomy project was located.
Its total value is estimated to exceed the billion euro.
Most of these money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-big mirror, whose diameter will be about 30 feet [39 m].
It will be collected from 798 six-angular segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT to obtain the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, the stars in other galaxies, and also to find Earth’s doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to monitor the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the middle of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome has only begun, mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory, scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years, since the first plans for the construction of E-ELT have been announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose aggregate value was Euro400 million, was received by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
