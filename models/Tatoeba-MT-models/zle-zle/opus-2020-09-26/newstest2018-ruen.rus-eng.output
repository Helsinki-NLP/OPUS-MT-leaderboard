President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law establishing administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is designed to address the very acute problem of failure to fulfil its obligations by the employers in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment under public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia commissioned the Attorney-General ' s Office to take special control.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfair contracts contracts that had not been funded, they tried to evade the payment obligations made and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, the Public Prosecution Service has made 9.7,000 submissions to defend entrepreneurs ' rights for public charges, resulting in their disciplinary review of 4.5,000 officials and 533 administrative officers, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies and 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were paid to entrepreneurs.
These immense amounts have been accumulated far from the non-payment of multi-million-year contracts.
Best-word debts have resulted in numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here's a characteristic case.
The leader of the small company won a contest for several million roubles of social transport services.
The man has invested all his negotiable funds, fully fulfilled the obligations, but he has not received the money in advance.
The result is a growing financial comma of salary debt, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek assistance from the Procurator ' s Office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been nullified as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt on public and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of the entities of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Prosecutor ' s Office operates in manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally holds visiting meetings with local authorities, where all open-ended violations and measures to eliminate them immediately are dealt with in detail by the prosecutors.
Such operational meetings were already held this year in Jaroslavla and Katherinburg.
Improved payment discipline of public employers will be able to implement Federal Act No. 189-FZ on amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with regard to the establishment of administrative responsibility of the employer ' s officials for the violation of the time period and of the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement to ensure public and municipal needs”, which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economy of Russia on the initiative of the Genprocuratora.
The new Act will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences by article, which provides a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for violation by the employer of the duration and manner in which the goods, work and services are paid in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been administratively punished for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of the entities of the Russian Federation have already been commissioned to ensure that these legislative innovations are applied in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Unit has announced a warning on the movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colorful People published a warning for the colored people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The Panel's statement reads: “The warning to travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of Colorful Populations, valid until 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travelers, visitors and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly attentive and to exercise greater caution in the travel of the State in connection with a number of doubtful racist incidents recently occurring throughout the state and brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People, the group had issued a warning on movement, which had led to a newly enacted law in Missouri, which made it more difficult for people to benefit from claims of discrimination and that State law enforcement agencies were disproportionately selecting minority targets.
“You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on roads because of colour, beaten and killed,” said Rhode Chape, President of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colorful People of Missuri, newspaper Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first such warning announced by the organization to the state of the United States.
The Group referred to incidents such as the humiliation of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year, after he had finished having petrol during a state trip, and the Missouri State police arrested him without accusing him of a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the Office of the Attorney-General of Missouri State, according to which the risk of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning that people be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” said Chaspel.
“People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money for the bail or report to their relatives that they travel through the State”.
According to recent data from the FBI hate crime programme, in Missouri, 100 hate crimes were recorded in 2015, making the State sixteenth according to the number of such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had issued warnings to travellers in Texas and Arizona after these States had enacted new immigration laws, which required local law enforcement authorities to arrest persons for violations of immigration laws, which, according to ACLU, should have increased the number of racially based checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State in relation to other countries, but in recent times public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed, three were injured.
All the wounded are taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed persons in the car opened fire on law enforcement personnel.
One of the wrongdoers was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on the lifting of free luggage for non-reflectable air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, in an interview with the RBC Telecommunication, stated that “properly” refers to the enactment of a law to cancel free luggage in non-return air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person with no luggage can buy a cheaper ticket than the one who has a luggage,” he stressed.
However, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothes and mobile phones in the handcuff.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that it's up to the top clothes, the umbrella, the mobile phone, the eaped, or even some computer that won't have any relationship," said Rosturism.
Previously, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the provision for free shipment of luggage in a non-reflective airliner.
It is the fact that airlines can determine the number and weight of luggage included in the non-refoulement tariff themselves.
Vladimir Putin commissioned to eliminate Baikal pollution
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, at a meeting on Baikal protection, reported that in recent years large lake territories had been extremely contaminated.
It mandated the identification of sources of financing, plans and performers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also requested a full recovery of the contaminated territories.
"We also need to understand the objects that continue to work here, the cleaning structures of most of them are worn out," quotes the President's RIA Newsty.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney-General of Russia should conduct a review of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental irregularities by recreation organizers.
“I want to emphasize that it is not all to check, but it is also a measure that needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful, and to take appropriate measures,” he stressed.
Hencourtura had previously reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites under environmental supervision.
Recall that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in the direct line, stated that legislation needed to be amended to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
The Olhon Island, which is located in the Baikal Nature, was informed of the problems of economic activity.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergei Donsky, immediately proposed a solution by clarifying the Baikal water protection zone, but the Government of Buratia recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were related to a number of regulations.
Previously, in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, it was suggested that the problem should be solved by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple will appear in Jugre
In the village of Sãova, members of the community of the indigenous small indigenous peoples of the North Rakhtinya, along with the residents of the Berez district, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the sanctuary, Nikolai Miracle Maker.
His location is a river shore, the temple will be well seen from a distance, so he will serve as a travel lighthouse for fishermen.
According to the community, construction work will be completed this year, the domes are now installed, and church bells are available.
The Igrim Fleet REB has provided transport escorts.
The temple is named after the Holy Nicholas Wondermaster, as it is considered by the Orthodox Church as a patron for travelers, including fishermen.
In Seventh, fishing provides work to settlers and feeds them.
The locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and the children even write about it in their school essays as a local sight.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with laws?
I'm talking to the local businessman Chang, sitting in a diner in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but the cigarettes are carefully folded into the iron box caught from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman is headed to the nearest urnament, to its 100 - foot [100 m] , and throws the bulls there.
The garbage fine in the public place is $500 locally, reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since my childhood: you can't throw a phantasm on a bridge, you'll be fined momentarily.
And now it's all the video cameras.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, like in the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted the graffiti wall of the old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced to raid.
What?
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the incredibly harsh laws, the AIF surveyor was on the ground.
There's no one thinking of abolishing the death penalty,' explains Victor Lee Hong's lawyer.
And the Government has long been indifferent to both the European Union and the United States.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or sells them, he has a velvet.
In 2002, 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 g cocaine with him.
It was advocated by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening with sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was eventually hanged up.
After that, the drug traffickers in our country are diligently moving side by side.
The point is that Singapore has established that laws are obliged to comply with ALL consecutively, not only with modest and poor people.
It doesn't matter who you are a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist, or a European resident.
The option is one: if you find cocaine shelf, you'll be hanged.
When you walk across Singapore and you meet a lot of warning plates, you're surprised to see how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing rubber is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be purchased strictly by a doctor’s prescription (!)
The tourist will not take the gum off at his arrival, but it's worth putting the cut in the subway, taking a fine of $1,000 locally.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on the neck, "I garbaged."
For the abandoned urea, the odor besides the fines is often sentenced to a silk in the palaces for a week to clean parks and beaches.
6000 rubbish pays a “criminal” who forgot to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a slight need in the residential elevator, a special detector works, doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Exotic laws include prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons on the street, public execution of songs, and even excessive polishing of the room plant (!): mosquitoes are considered to attract abundant water.
To avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined by 5,000 Singapore bucks.
Anyway, you're going to think, "Without effort, you're going to break something."
That's not right, but it's trying to find me Mohammed Kabyriya, the owner of the local tourist.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I have not seen anyone attracted to them for their violation.
Why do they stay?
So that citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are strictly monitored.
Let's say if a minor is sold a cigarette in the quiosque, he's gonna be punished on the chain: the shop owner will pay a huge amount, the breaker himself will get hit with the sticks on the back, and the seller will also be shot and imprisoned.
It was because of such severe laws that the offence in Singapore was very rare.
Is that justified?
During the seventy years, we had chaos on roads — motorists ignored the lights, traveled as they wanted, drank behind the drive.
After the fines were imposed, everything calmed down in a year.
The driver now knows that if he stops, the police will not let him go for a bribe, pay a fine at the cost of the apartment, and send him for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to have a concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disneilland with the death penalty”, a visitor from the United States, terrified the wealth of the inhabitants, the “dangerously clean airport” and the “cultural nature”.
Discovering, such things are indescribable, artificial, and so shouldn't be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the sidewalk, you're seizing if you're in the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and suddenly, a break of the template: a bus stop has a plastic glass.
"What about this?" you're surprised.
And that's what the Singaporeans smile.
Anything happens.
It is not for every kind of "crime" that you will be caught on the ground, but you should know that if you are computed, you will not be retaliated. You have violated the law.
Most of this is enough for a person to act normally.
Of course, Singapore is authoritarian.
But you know what?
In the Vietnamese Hoshemine, I traveled very carefully, and motorcycleists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the middle of Paris, there's a lot of dirty bastards and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets, too, is trying to throw garbage into garbage.
Singapore, however, has become the world ' s most peaceful, clean and safe city through the recruitment of dragon fines and merciless laws (until the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: Remember, and in Russia no one was stuck by the wheel until they got fined.
Although Singapore is not the most important penalties, it is voluntary law enforcement.
And we have to think that we in Russia would also have people with clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and we'd welcome the arrest of those who confused the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment, thanks, don't.
On the other hand, Singapore's laws are at least worth looking at them.
Nothing holy?
Now the White House of Trump is targeted on Article Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
The Americans understand it no less than all the others -- from here deliberately the theatrical demolition of Saddam Hussein's statue on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Government of Trump, was undoubtedly aware of what he did when he took a symbolic axe over the Statue of Freedom during a violent dispute with journalist CNN Jim Akost on Presidential proposals for a dramatic reduction in legal migration.
Be honest, Miller hasn't tasted the statue.
The owners of the pleasure ships and artisans representing the Statue Freedom would linger to him if he tried to do so.
But he tempted her, especially on the point she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus’s poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller burst out in Akost, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Freedom Statue is... a symbol of American freedom that obscures the world.
The content you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller made the facts right, but as he said, it's not really a story.
This is about the sound of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your fatigues, your poor people, your crowds, who dream of breathing freely, / the Incredible Departures of your insolvent shores."
Never before have "unprivilegable dumps" been so visible on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he told me that in America the Tempa of these people weren't waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who struggled to put her words on a statue after her death, were very well aware that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture of the purpose was to indicate the link between the French and the American Republics through a banal classical figure, the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she got a very different name, Mother of the Ignored.
The connection of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a destructive attack against American Nazism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, even though to change it back.
The Ground Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptizer, who announced the Trump coming in 2010, reasoned that freedom did not invite anyone, rather she was an early neo-conservator carrying the flames of America to the dark of the world: "Freedom is coming forward.
It bears the fake of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
It's not to light the way to the United States."
Limbo's resistance to the usuality is really at the point.
The purpose of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as it would be seen by the fierce, unhappy but full hope of people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This means literally looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a better life.
Its statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And of course, that's not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch needs not to light the way, but to incite hatred that is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the British assembly.
Ailed Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottish men in the collection of Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the British Federation of Light Athletics, stated that the Scottish part of the World Cup would make a “significant contribution to the team game.”
The record number of Scotland Scottish leopards was selected for the 2017 London Championship beginning on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland, “something special” and the British Federation of Light Athletics should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support as long as they have potential," said Blake.
"I talked to people at Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Easy Athletics thinks they have to work with what they've done.
The British Federation of Easy Athletics: with what they did, we have to work.
And the people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things have come up, but it's really brilliant."
Some of the Scottish Scottish leopards claim for medals, including Laura Mür and Andrew Bachert, who will rival Sir Mo Farah for a distance of 5,000 metres; and Ailed Doyle has chosen her captain.
"Aleid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"Scotlanders, whether they're Scots or not, and from where they live or train, have come out of this room, feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Alied put into her were wonderful."
The holder of the Commonwealth ' s silver medal championship, who, at its fifth World Cup, will run 400 metres of obstacles, says that 16 Scottish people in the British assembly are “unlikely”.
The previous record of the Scottish world championship was seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mure, a middle-distance specialist, hit five British and two European record last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500-m run, is another Scottish who should be aware of the successful season behind his back in which there were wins in the selection competitions of the British assembly and the annual competitions.
Doyle recalls her first championship of the world when she was the only Scottishman on the team.
The captain of the team says she's "unlikely proud" by the fact that so many of her fellow countrymen have not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they're going to claim for medals and fight for the finals.
"Capitan is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a great honour in any case, but to know that your comrades voted for you and you were chosen, it's a very special thing for me," she added.
"Sure, I'm very proud of all Scottish people who came into the assembly.
This shows how much we have done.
And they are all the junkies that have been made, and they will try to gain the honor of the pedestal.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I'm just saying that we're lucky to accept the World Championship at home.
So it's just how important it's to get support from the fans and to take advantage of the fact that we're going back to the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere will be great."
Critics locking on Facebook: you don't have to be public unless you're ready to listen to voter criticism.
The founder of our country understood what the critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, was annoying.
But he didn't shut his mouth to critics.
Because, as early as 1783, Washington said, "We can take free speech away from us, deaf and dumb, and lead as sheep to slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this.
Subordinate governors called this claim negligible, and an Internet comment was written in the spirit of "no and what."
"It's just Facebook," many say.
But that's also important.
And that's especially important when it's about a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular republican governor in a democratic state.
He is second in his approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an obstinate reactor.
It has demonstrated a strong hand in the administration of the State and its adherence to its principles.
He also makes good use of Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his voters and jesting to show his head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking the people who come to the Governor's page - which is declared to be an official public forum and is carried out by the staff of the administration for taxpayers is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In the interview of the Washington Post, Spokesman Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that the blocking of the comments is just their modernization.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spears, and heyers that are vicious on the Internet.
"Post" talked to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trollly, a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who call on their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
Pastor quoted the Bible as appealing to the fact that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramann of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by the lack of his response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the commentary section on the Post article.
"I don't like the idea, too, that when a lot of people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say that it's a so-called curvature instead of acknowledging that they're dealing with a large group of unhappy citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call "concentrated spam-attack," others would probably call "active life position."
In Facebook, it is easy to edit your image, simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required people to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical frontiers or arrest and stumble the mouth of the protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in the digit.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized because he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and other social groups.
The President of Trump had been filed with the Twitter users who had been stolen in his Twitter acunt.
One of the first turning decisions on the topic was taken this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris of Alexandria, the president of the County Monitoring Board, Laudon, violated the First Amendment by winning the voter in her Facecbook account.
In Kentucky, the Republican Governor Matt Bevin filed claims by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behaviour in Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so hard.
During Washington’s time, the age of available mail costs was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers rose four times, and the anonymous letters had severely undermined his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the names of Yuricola, Valerius, Balizarius and Porcius wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents compiled by George Washington's online document, his office was filled with petitions criticizing his position on the Friendship, Trade and Maritime Treaty.
But he didn't try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lie at the very foundation of our State.
And true leadership means concurring with it.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for the domestic comforts at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferti, hopes for the residential comforts for the next three days when the Renaissance Club will receive the twenty-fifth open Scotland golf tournament for older athletes.
A Nordic native who led a neighborhood at the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year until Paul Ilsa lost his new place and acted as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I saw the construction of the Renaissance Club, and we see how it comes to success with the event,” said Rafferti.
"The games will see this field at its best moment, it's in a great state.
Jerry did a great job to set up this place.
He's a strong adherent to this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englishman Ils looks forward to holding championship for the first time, even though his 32-year career has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It's a really special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't try to win "Extremadura Open" again because he was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a beautiful golf place.
Last year's memories are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sheron, it was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was a really special time, and we will always remember it.”
Gary Orr, acceded to the European tournament for older athletes, is returned to the battle in his homeland after he was 50 years old this year.
The event will be his first appearance in Scotland from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said Helensboror.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I enjoyed playing again, and I showed a good golf.
I am pleased with the way things are being done."
In this field, the former winner of the Masters tournament of Ian Woostm and the medjours champions for older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalti will join.
Orr and former Captain Rider Cup Sam Thorrans are two of the six Scottish on the field; the others are Andrew Aldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmüir and Ross Drammond.
Participation in a tournament is free, and parking costs five pounds an hour if one person is in the car and 10 pounds if the person is two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads learn to absorb harmful emissions
Tests on British roads are already under way for tunnels capable of absorbing carbon oxide emissions from cars.
The country ' s transport agency reported the positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests on a highway in the north of the country.
A tunnel of 6 metres is constructed of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb the harmful substances contained in the automobile exhaust.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the extensive measures the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the electrical charge stations, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, increase the use of commercial transport on electrical traction and modernize the heavy trucks ' park.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollutants are transported, and air dissatisfaction causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Moshorud has changed the punishment of a disabled Mamaev for a fine.
Moshorud has changed the punishment of an invalid to Anton Mamajew, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, for a fine of 200,000 roubles.
This is reported by the TACS.
Previously, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office requested the court to replace the term with a conditional sentence by explaining its request that Mamaev ' s disease prevents his finding in prison conditions.
Anton Mamayev, aged 28, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, serving sentences in a general regime, whose victim was a former fighter.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a visiting meeting in SIZO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Prepare for lunch, Bardin Degei does not use a plate.
She does not even use a pot.
In its wooden house in Enarotala, the capital of Paniaya County, in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewives usually simply puts sweet potatoes, which here is called a note, right into the window.
In about half an hour, the stolen tuber is taken and eaten with impatient, unwitting hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor, she doesn't have furniture, and this is where she is doing her homework, such as clothing with mud water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Multiplicity is rampant here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk the village after five evenings," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at the daily life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands to the occupying forces.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains strict control over the region, not allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarata is a city as remote as the abandoned city; the road here includes a 1,5 - hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, the Nabira, and then a five - hour ride on a mercenary car.
There's no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses wrapped with bamboo fences; the roofs of the grove are painted with rustles in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians came here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, pagoes mego worshiped the god Uga Tamaei.
Other changes were made.
"We were not used to wear this clothing," says Degei, showing on his bright, hand-writing turban, a dark turkey and a bright shirt.
"Lord, we only wore leaves on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live below the poverty line, and rates of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian golden land.
The world ' s largest gold mine and its most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, located in Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniaya, a high-level province of about New Jersey, where 153,000 people live.
In 2015 alone, Freeport obtained some $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be praised by forest stockpiles, valued at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, brings one calamity to the papouas, guaranteeing that Indonesia's powerful armed forces retain their suffocating presence here.
According to the New York Times Inquiry in 2005, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the papouas threaten the existence of this gold and are mercilessly suppressed.
Human rights defenders claimed that more than 500,000 papouas had been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands had been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the massacres of indigenous inhabitants of Papua highlands in the seventieth years can be considered genocide.
Only last year had the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We'll lose everything”, a 2016 Brisbane eparchy report contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — especially the frequency claimed in another report, rape and electric shock — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because the incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Guyks have been prolonged since Papua resources have attracted the influx of displaced persons from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million provincial population consists of 83 per cent of Christians, but populations change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely populated Indonesian islands, Yawa, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Japanese benches, “varings”, sell chicken roasted and a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to endure competition.
“Migrants began selling chickens and vegetables cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet Yow, a 20-year-old woman named Paniai who moved to Jayapur, the provincial administrative centre, because of her work.
“The indigenous people of Papua Mama (women) have lost their market.”
President Joco Vidododo of Indonesia, known in the people as Jokovi, vowed to engage in inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter received support from 27 out of 29 Papua districts, including Panama.
In Papua, however, nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice,” says Joe.
In fact, only two months after the Jokowi Paniai Inauguration, he experienced the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and the singing of Christmas hymns at the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the dark.
The feared children told them that they should include headlamps.
According to the local pastor, Javedt Tebai, a soldier insulted their tone and returned some time afterward with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and beating their rifles.
Then a soldier shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone fired a nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the next day the situation got worse.
About a thousand Papouas men, women and children gathered in the soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunters' bows, and filled the waite, and the papouas mee pago, and ran around and depicted a bird’s song.
Some protesters began to push stones into the police station and the military base.
When the situation arose, an order was given to soldiers on the internal radio: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, so he sounded, as stated in the official document that the TIME correspondents saw, but which was not published in the local media.
Fiftieth - year - old Eremias Kaiama, head of Kego Koto district in Enarotala, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told the TIME magazine, standing on the wing of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but he says the bullet came on the side of the troops gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were lots of shots," he adds.
The local resident of Alfius Jove had three times as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” gloomily told Johanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotja Mende, Senior Police Inspector of Papua, told the reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because it was attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten us to be killed,” said the representative of the Police of Papua Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
"This is the question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more wounded.
The news of the murders came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a hot speech in Jayapur, in which he expressed condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security of Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But almost immediately we resent.
“The majority of the violations have occurred long ago.
Some of them took place at ninety or at the beginning of zero.
The point is that we definitely want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed”, he said.
Viranto then refused to speak to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not intend to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “All will be settled through the trial.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of over 1,000 people during a bloody vote for East Timor's independence in 1999, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Panama.
Families of victims from Panama met such statements with a dismal distrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the last three years, but there has been no change,” says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I'm afraid I'm being arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also felt that the people of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we bury our bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired in villagers in nearby Denmark district of Panama.
During a collision between villagers and the construction company manager who refused to help take the man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Dow, who was drowned during fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Anguished villagers protested to the office of the company ' s construction site.
According to the police, the villagers had stoned officers who had fired warning fires in response.
However, local residents claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) fired on the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” reported 20-year-old Dominggu Badiya, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded rushed.
"I've been hiding at my house for two days."
The Dayi Parliament demanded that the officers involved be called upon to respond, and the mobile police team withdraw from the region.
Pania has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development is a source of displeasure for mee, Moni, Dani and damal tribes scattered across the greenlands of the central highlands of Papua.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army, which asserts that it protects the rights of the papouas by hosting sporadic attacks and flights to kidnapping Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the OPM are from Paniai, including Tadius Jogi and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and groundlessly detained under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some of them never returned.
Among the population of Papua Panama, it is considered a “healthy, forgotten place”.
Poverty exacerbates dissatisfaction.
A small portion of the rice sold in Enarotala is too expensive for the local population.
Bread is unavailable to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat, mostly notes, and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Usually, they keep most of the crops for the family and the rest are sold on the local market.
The ten tuber note is only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous papouas and new migrants have increased, which have arrived in large quantities since the introduction of new airlines at the Nabira airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papouas rarely lack money or skills to pursue their own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Panama.
Insulation keeps Papua far from the rest of the world.
Furthermore, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate cohesion with the relevant organizations” despite the fact that they were given rare permits to conduct the video.
According to Felima Kiné, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises given during the Jokovi election campaign have not been met in order to promote transparency and development.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebel eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, are facing new dangers: denial of visa and blacklisting”, he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “extreme and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia Arramant Nasir rejected the statement of the group by informing journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia, a democratic system still exists and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When a Dutch official delegation headed by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Kiis Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, the locals violated silence by saying: “We want freedom”, as the source asserts, who also attended the meeting, but who wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, the new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the popes say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokovi.
"Joqui is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are part of the shooting in Panama," said Gobai, president of the tribe's council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat of the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other pasuas, consider their voice to be for Jokovi, the debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Panama resulted in the execution of the last symbolic act of disobedience: the body of one of the victims in the land was buried in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely to never succeed, they will at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
“We killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without lifting his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The fire is secondly covered by the Oakel skyscrape
The fire covered one of the world's highest residential skyscrubs in Dubai on Friday, causing hundreds of residents to rush out of the seventy-five-foot-foot-wave construction of 337 metres high.
It's a second fire that's been fired on a high building, which is concurrently called Fakel in two years.
The building was evacuated, human victims were not reported, and there was no prompt news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people's shouts.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” said the Reuter Creak resident, named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, fire teams extinguished the fire at approximately 4:00 local time (00:00 on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
It could raise security issues for materials used in excerviers of high buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the Faquela Administration after the fire there in 2015, it was found that weeping — the outer panels used for forming and isolation — was the most affected.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that it was the view that the system of isolation and crying panels of the Grenfell-Tauer building in London could expedite the spread of the June fire, resulting in the death of some 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flow in Ida Virumaa in June proved to be minimal
According to the data reported by the portal rus.err.ee received from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the services of North-East hotel facilities were totalled by 20,519 local and foreign tourists, an increase of 125, or 0.6 per cent, than in the same period earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, the overseas tourist has increased by 7.3 per cent (544 people) in June to 794.
The number of local tourists fell by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The largest number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9 per cent, or 318 in comparison with June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 visitors from the RF stayed at Ida Virumaa Hotels.
Andrey Malakhov gave a sense to worshippers who were responsible for his departure
Andrey Malakhov impelled his worshipers to Instagram who would blame him for leaving the first channel.
To date, he has not commented on rumors, but today he has placed a section of the article “Videoty” of August 1.
Malakh's photo was signed by a boss of milk.
The article on how to prevent and pay attention to the "growth" of the employee.
Remembering the many reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformatte "The Speak Out", it becomes clear that he was so transparent, writes "PS".
Television leader Andrey Malakhov was reportedly on leave and did not sign the application for dismissal from the first channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the coming days.
Five military personnel were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers died in the explosion in the Afghan province of Guilmand, transmitting the RIA Newsty.
According to the police, a mined car exploded the previous night next to the military blockpost in Girshk's departure.
It's known about 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new FP took place in Hirishk.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Daver took a video that bit his camera of shark.
Daver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) sealed a shark on a video that bit his GoPro cam.
Rolek has been deployed to Facebook by the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August at Cape Kod Peninsula in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the portal Necn.
The man tried to remove the shark on a camera held on a special stick during the underwater navigation.
When he noticed the man, the animal came to him with a length of more than three feet [3 m].
Acula started to bite a camera, and she didn't try to attack a scientist.
The stomach explained that the predator had done the same to determine whether the gedget was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that such a marine animal’s behavior was in novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass fight at the Ural Military Centre has become known
A working group of senior military officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where a mass fight occurred, to investigate the incident.
Some details of this belligerence have already been known.
According to the Mash paddies on the VContact page, Uralian military contractors in part 31612 were brutally attacked because of an unmanaged bed.
It all started with the fact that Saian's rodential order was disregarded by the officer's order to fill in the cracking sheet.
The officers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Saiana supported the first mouth.
In half an hour, 140 young men were stolen in the barracks of beds and shells, and the glass was beaten.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
In the CIA, the information on the navigator was denied.
The study showed that at least one fifth of the United States passengers carried prohibited items into the aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of air passengers were deliberately or accidentally carrying on the luggage of the aircraft through the United States Transport Safety Administration inspection points prohibited items, including at least 6 per cent sitting on a plane with banned knives or other sharp items under surveillance.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., covering over 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they were deliberately trying to fly with something that was prohibited by ATP, 19.7 per cent were millenias compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the Generation X.
Wisely, ATP staff are most likely to carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that acute items had been specially carried out through searches, while 2.2 per cent of respondents to women and 3.7 per cent of men respondents admitted that they deliberately carried prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that she had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through airport searches, and how many of them were deliberately doing so.
It is expected that most of the world is deliberately or deliberately smuggling those who fly most.
According to the company, the ATP rules are rather complex and confused.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what amount.
It is therefore not surprising that most of what ATP takes is prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATP could be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are permitted on internal flights, but not on international.
Chapter EPA Prüitt refuses the intention to defer implementation of Obama emission reduction regulations
The following day, following the 15 states' claim, the head of the Environment Agency rescinded its decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama to reduce emissions of air pollutants and the potential for education.
Prüitt explained his decision that his agency was now more likely to listen to the needs of individual state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The sporadic sporadic approach was about 1 October, to which States should meet the Ozone Standards of 2015 at the ground level.
In June, Prüitt announced that it would postpone its implementation for one year to give its agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
The Prüitt, who, before being appointed President Trump to his current position, had long been known as the Attorney-General of the State of Oklahoma as a consistent opponents of tightening environmental standards.
After moving to Washington Prüitt, it has repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of rules against the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change in the course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Piwitt to return to the old rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority in trying to postpone the Obama Administration's regulation requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Prüitt suggested that he simply had the responsibility of EPA to cooperate with States in the comprehensive process of implementing new standards in a timely manner.
“In previous EPA administrations, it was often unable to meet within the time frame, after which the action was pending from the activists and other individuals and discussed the time frames for the settlement of the case,” said Prüitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous post.
“We do not believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority that he gives us.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that the Prüitt may at some point reuse its “reservation authority and other legal powers” to ensure that the rules of jcyjdfys are clear and available.
The Republicans in Congress insist on a wider revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The Senate on this matter has not yet voted.
The Attorney-General of New York, Eric Schneiderman, who headed the Coalition of the States that filed a complaint this week against EPA, said that the group intended to continue its legal pressure.
"The change in the course of EPA, after our claims, is an important victory in the fight for health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the ability to cover their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombian County joined in the New York.
Ozone at the ground level arises when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, refineries and chemicals and other sources enter the atmosphere with solar light.
This could cause serious problems with breathing in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected shift of Prüitt.
"It's hard to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the man who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Burd of the Biodiversity Center.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump Administration and to protect those polluting the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extended the removal of the World Federation of Light Athletics
The International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) Congress voted in favour of extending the suspension of the World Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended that the suspension remain valid.
For the extension of the suspension, 166 persons, versus 21, passed the TACS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards the conditions established by the Member Restoration Board, but that these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Because of the disqualification of the WFLA in the London World Cup, Russian light athletes were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
The team was composed of 19 persons admitted to the IAAF Primaryity.
WFLA was disqualified indefinitely by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dicka Pauld, was then published, describing numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Board, see the “U.A.A.V.A.A.P.D.”
Abnormal defeat
Within 3 tour of the Fonbeth-Privacy of Russia, the PFL teams of the Newo-Scotch Chimick conducted a visiting match against the Kaluga FC.
Less than 10 days ago, rivals played each other in a Russian cup, but this time the painting was quite different.
The hymic did not give up to the opponents, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive naked and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the calbubanes, many prophesied a light victory of the hosts in advance.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the newcomers have been compelled to be treated and acted from defence but from a position of force.
In the first time, the cafés were built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
A very qualitative match was held by Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and acted with confidence.
Unfortunately, the attack on Chemical lacked the effort and luck to impose a stalemate on Kalugi ' s defense and to kill the first naked on the exit.
After a break, the game began running in counter courses.
Newborns were more active in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team have become defence errors, which have allowed the cabbage to create a number of acute moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemical overtook the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the caluzan experience played a role -- they had a more literate and cold-blood end by waiting for their moment to take the gates.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemical moved the ball to the corner, whereby the owners of the fields were put to the gate without resistance.
Yuri Dubrovin was the naked author.
In the reporting meeting, Chemical demonstrated a good game but suffered an offensive defeat.
Our team is awaiting another visit on August 11, 19, in Moscow, at the Torredo Stadium, named Edward Strölzov, the newlyweds will fight with the favorite Centr group "Ararat", composed of Roman Pavlučenko, Marat Imaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexay Rebko.
Come back to "Chimic!"
The location and time of the meeting of the newlyweds is 6.30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (East, d.2, corp.

According to published telephone distributors, Tramp pressed Mexico on the fee of the wall on the border
The Washington Post published telephone interviews between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a telephone conversation with President Enrique Penhei Nieta Tramp, Mexico, he insisted that he cease to publicly claim that he would not pay for the planned wall on the border.
The U.S. President harassed him for his public speech against the wall and, according to the information he slipped, told him, “You can't speak this to the press”.
The trump began its election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Australia, was also reported in the publication.
The Trunkbullu said that the U.S. agreement to accept refugees sending to Australia, “crazy”, “abhorrent” and “different” and insisted that it would look like an idiot because of the Obama Administration's agreement to stop resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump concluded his conversation, saying to Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation in the entire day.”
The bodies of dead tourists in Abkhazia were sent by a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
The aircraft owned by the Russian Air Force, on board which the bodies of the deceased Russian women in Abkhazia are located, flew 20:15 by Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, transmits the TASS.
At the end of the post, the officers of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city mayor, will meet on the board, and the journalists will be told by the Deputy Minister for Kuorth and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
Previously, representatives of the MSC of the Republic stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia had taken over the Abkhazia Government.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation of 500,000 roubles to the families of the deceased.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazi leadership was willing to pay to the relatives of the tourists who had been killed as a result of the explosions, but relatives had sent only confidence to the Republic to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 by Moscow time, two explosions in the village of Primarsk of the Gudout region in the rocket-artillery weaponry of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic had been unheated, after which the large-scale missiles and other munitions had been detonated.
As a result, the warehouse fired, causing uncontrolled shell explosions of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Polakova, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timopheev, born in 1962, who were at rest near a serum source.
64 persons, including 35 nationals of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia nationals, were taken to the medical facilities of the Republic with various injuries.
At present, seven persons remain in the stationary, the rest of them being ordered.
Examination of the Russian impact on the American elections will take place in a large jury
The Special Prosecutor for Russia, Robert Muller, called a large jury in Washington, D.C., who will study the Russian influence on the U.S. President’s elections in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters Agency.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The material collected will examine the Special Prosecutor and decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The large jurisprudence gives Muller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the following investigations to the jury panel, which began working a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son, then the candidate for President Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalie Wesselnicka.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller himself had previously promised.
They're already studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Tramp Junior had expanded his legal profession.
Trump Junior had previously told me that he had waited for a compromising party for the candidate's headquarters of Hillari Clinton Dempartia, but no descriptive documents had been submitted, and that was the adoption.
At the beginning of August, a number of media reported that the Tempa Junior ' s statement of the meeting with Wesselica was literally dictated by the Elder Trump.
In the White House, it was clarified that the President had not dictated anything but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Penza vice mayor detained in the workplace
The Deputy Head of Administration of Penza Irin Shirshin is detained for 48 hours on instructions from the Investigative Committee at its work place, reports RIA Newsty.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on the matter have not yet been received, but the SSC press assured them that they will soon follow.
The Pensa mayor has not yet commented on what happened.
Irena Shirschin is one of the five Vice-Chiefs of Penza.
It has managed urban affairs and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had worked for a long time as the head of the Directorate of State Management in the Pennsylvania region.
Irina Shirshina has raised three minor children, notably that she had again become a mother a year ago, refused to take her leave and returned to work.
Of course, there's no spacefield in Mexico or no launcher missiles.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Jury Gagarin's Bulletin is a tribute to the first person who was in space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period that are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin are, on the other hand, "has been hit by the planet."
In 2012, a monument was installed at the American Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument was established in the territory of the Royal Observatory for the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There's a monument of Gagarina in Germany in Erfut, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Carlov Varah, Czechia, escaped from the public protests in 1992 and was transferred from the city centre to the area in front of the local airport.
In the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga, a monument appeared for Yurius Gagarins.
That's the name and name of the first cosmonaut in Latvia, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Mors Ford murder: activists lose Linch courts on the stage to call for justice
The Fard Mercury, in 1948, traveled past the Monroe village in Georgia and roared to the little bridge of Mors Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove to the bridge, a group of white men with guns prevented her from going.
The main man, the middle-year-old man in his dress in a thin strip, pulled over the cigar and looked through the windscreen.
The inner trembling of fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" rumbled the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying squeaked the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just incense.
But when Roger's neck was thrown into the loop, almost all the spectators were actually breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to Mors Ford Bridge to re-emerge the night that the dolluxclanians lingered two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malk and George and May Murray Dorsey, in 1946.
No one was convicted for these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no person has been arrested - although we see them close to us; although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped to organize a plot.
"It's a spot in our history and it's a stone on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgian Congress, who struggles for human rights for the rest of his life.
For him, the spectacle is a dramatic appeal for action and an annual reminder to Monroe people that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must achieve justice," he says.
“We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the survivors of the lynching at Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI material received by Enbi Ci News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in lingering.
But no one was charged.
Although suspects have been on their own for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of the two related motives of linguists: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court order was for the first time authorized by black citizens to vote in praimeriz, which was due to take place in the summer.
Approximately during the same elections, according to the FBI, the black user Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester's knife, a white landowner, by sight, because of women.
Brooks says that by hearings in the city, Hester slept with his wife, Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to be born was not from her husband.
The FBI reported on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in a mortgage to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove from prison and drove to Morse Ford's bridge, a crowd of ringers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded assassinations," this conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
“It is also clear that there was a conspiracy between the state and city law enforcement agencies that not only took part in murders but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
"It was an attempt to vote," he says.
"They all were killed to send a signal to the black in the city, and if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has led the annual play of the lynching at the Mors Ford bridge.
Its spectacle is visible, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that many would like to see is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks it's the most important thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linch courts because they show us our own freakyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors, a dozen whites, the other blacks, gathered in the room and listened to the tire review over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He had played a role as the chief member of the clan for several years, but he said that the role had not become easier.
"I feel like I'm sleeping because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The sport begins with the Malcolm, erupted by Hester's sleeping with his wife, Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said nigga, get out of my house!"
Knocks the Descona back.
There's a blow coming.
At the same time, all (at least all black actors) are grieved.
Green laughs louder than everyone else.
"What's the matter," asks Ascona.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'nogga'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say hard 'r'."
And the same is true of energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of company.
All must do the right thing, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when the Descona says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
Spectacle ends cruelly and quickly.
Cricky, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a mourning black clothing stands over the bodies of the actors and performs a sad song of Billy Hollyday "Strange Fruit."
Her voice is interrupted by word.
Half a hundred yards from her eyes are wiped out of tears and sweat.
The number of blacks and whites is almost equal among the audience.
One couple came from Tokyo, New York, to see the show; many live close to them.
They all endured the heavy spirits of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks was driving them to pilgrimage to the tombs of Malcolmov and Dorsey.
Until that time, the killings were only a story, but now that they are standing at the same place where people lingered, they seem to be being screwed up in the air.
When the last note of the song gets quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children blend to their heads, touch the paint that paints the blood, and the immobile bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They aren't really dead," a little boy mutters like to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw ropes off the neck and wipe tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, a man in a suit that played the main dollwixclan.
Nick Descona hugs two other actors, and suddenly, weeping, falls into their arms, and the emotional load of the spectacle finally hit him.
"All right," one of the women whispers.
"We know your heart is good.
You have reason to do so."
Later, the spectacles will sit down with the actors.
At one desk, a white couple from Atlanta lively discuss the play with the black couple they just met.
Denise Dapplinsky hardly finds words to describe what she feels after the play.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After this, I think lynchations are still happening," she adds, "but now it's called the police shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, shared his attention.
He says he's already starting to plan the next year's submission.
"The order is encouraging to us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you do not learn from this lesson, it may happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their story, are destined to repeat it."
The Court fined Naval for violations on “Aguitation Saturday”
The Simon's Court of Moscow has fined Alexey Naval for a 300,000-round violation of the organization of the meeting.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in article 20, paragraph 8, of the CAP of the RF “Repetual Misconduct for the organization of the meeting”.
Earlier, Judge of the Simon's Court of Justice, Moscow Hizir Mussakaev, concluded an administrative case with regard to Leonid Wolkova, head of the opposition officer, Alexey Naval, who had been brought to justice under the same article as Naval.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on “Aguitation Saturday”, which Naval supporters held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitmaterials following the Saturday, the police felt that the organizers of the event had deliberately concealed its true essence, the public action (to which the capital authorities had to ask prior authorization).
Leonid Volkov and his attorneys Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuyv filed an application for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the absence of composition of the offence and indicated that the police had made certain shortcomings in the preparation of the protocol.
On Volkov ' s agitation sabbath itself, he was not delayed, but he received a agenda requiring him to appear at the police station to report on an event carried out with his active participation.
The same agenda was given to Naval and another opposition partner, Nikolaskin.
In Mordovia, the firing bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordovia arrested a local resident who had shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the Republican Office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred in the evening of July 29th.
During the controversy, the 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several occasions at the guests of the events that came to the village pond to bury.

European Union expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The European Press Service stated on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded due to a scandal around Simens production turbines in Krum.
This has been reported earlier by the “Arguments of the Week”.
The EU Press Service stated that sanctions against the RFs were expanded because of the Simens turbines scandal, which were allegedly brought to the Crimea in the sanction.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand the anti-Russian sanctions.
Previously, it was reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and the decision was taken that the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pierson reduces 3,000 more jobs and reduces the dividends to bring the business back to life
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Pierson announced that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of prior dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems facing their business.
These job reductions, which, according to John Fellon, will take place mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in an addendum to 4,000 jobs that have been reduced in the previous restructuring.
Pirson announced that he planned to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May during the third cost-reduction programme to try to rebuild the business that had hit the rapid transition to digital learning methods.
A company that had agreed to sell its share in the publication “Penguin Random House” to its partner, the Bertelsman constituency, said that its projections per year remained unchanged after she announced a 1 per cent increase in the sale of the main item in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Convoy attack in Kabul: Nato soldier died as a result of the death bombing
According to information from official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, as NATO reported.
According to untrusted data from local sources, three civilians were also killed by the incident in the town area of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last of the massacres that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people died as a result of a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people at the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
NATO reported that the explosion that took place on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by “a man-made explosive device”.
All wounded are reported to be in stable condition and receive treatment at the American Military Hospital at the Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IU) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces located near the Bagram.
In the first half of 2017, the United Nations reported that at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing on the car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban claimed they had attacked.
On 31 May, more than 150 people died as a result of a powerful blast in the city center — the most serious of human victims in the country since the United States troops led the United States to remove the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence is stressing the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while the U.S. President Donald Trump assesses whether the United States military force that assists troops and police in the country should be increased.
According to correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul during the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana.
The Environmental Protection Agency, after the judicial proceedings, rescinds the decision to postpone the adoption of the Law on Air Pollution
The American Environment Agency has rescinded the decision to postpone the Obama Age Act, which requires States to limit air pollution emissions a day after 15 states have been brought to court for the agency as a result of this step.
In the evening on Wednesday, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone measurements 2015, emphasizing that this step demonstrates the readiness of the Agency to cooperate with the States.
“We believe in dialogue and feedback with our States partners”, said Scott Prüitt, leader of the Environment Agency.
In June, Prüitt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet more strict air purity standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the federal district of Colombia filed a claim that this intention was illegal.
The Presidential Administration of Donald Trump is trying to retreat a wide range of environmental protection decisions introduced by the previous President Barak Obama within a broader programme, which, according to Tramp, is aimed at brilliant economic growth.
However, actions in this regard have raised resistance by democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on health.
The Environmental Protection Agency ' s website states that the use of ozone-containing air “can deteriorate the function of light and reinforce respiratory symptoms”, such as as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed the new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the economic sanctions of the United States against the FM.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement stated that business was an important link between countries and people, so free trade principles could not be restricted.
The European Business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from policy and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies request the police to limit the movement on the Coast in the Pskov
The Pskov People's Elections addressed the UMVD Chief of the City of Sergei Surien on the issue of the movement on the Great River.
Deputies of the hordes of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Parties and Valerie Lesnikovs believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, control of drivers would help to make the Territory more secure and safe.
The problem is that the violators ignore the signs of the “Pedestrian track” and ride freely on the coastal side.
Capital repairs and improvements are expected to be in vain.
Sports and children's areas are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the Central Coast Patrol is patrolled by PPP and the Woman's Motopatrule on the evenings.
This reduces the number of cars travelling, but does not stop completely.

British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Faja in screening the Harry Potter series of novels, died for the 92nd year of his life.
This was reported on Thursday by the Indian.
The actor's death was told by his relatives.
They say he's lived a "big life by making a success in movies, theatre and television over 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English Celtnham курort.
In 1959, at the stage of the Royal Shakespearean Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in the Tragedia of Coriolan.
Hardy also remembered the roles played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of the screenings of Agatha Kristi about Ms. Marple.
The Wilderness Years (1981) awarded the British Academy of Cinematographic and Television Arts (BAFTA) for the performance of Churchill's role in the BBC Television Drama.
Robert Hardy also had to serve as President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt on several occasions.
There was something in the Danish State: Prince Henrik, and in fact, Henry Marie André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with her venerate wife, Queen Margret.
This year the counts have a single wedding, but on the agenda of the couple is not preparations for the celebrations, but a lucrative dispute.
His highness abandoned the title of the consort prince, and he turned to the queen that he had never yet resented the title of the consort king.
Henrik lives in France, although he is officially married to the queen.
WID of Russia called on Washington to stop helming Moscow
In the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of destabilizing the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement by the foreign policy department has been circulated some time ago.
In its commentary, the MID pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps that were inappropriate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop shabbling the RF.
As the Week Armuments were written before, U.S. vice president Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the western Balkans and organizing an unsuccessful coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko meet for the first time, there's a conversation about the possibility of a decisive team.
Vasili Lomachenko and Mike Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving towards the most exciting boxing match of up to £ 147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN office spaces in Los Angeles until Garcia, an inevitable champion in the lightweight of the World Banking Council, went through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Banking Organization champion in the second half weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world champion in four weight categories, Erien Broner, on Saturday, both boxers are in the five of the best boxers, regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How are you, champ?
Good luck with you."
Lomachenko protects his belt in a meeting with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers were summoned for the photograph, manager Lomachenko Egis Climas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the most important fight.
"I've been in a half weight before," recalls Garcia.
“I'm up to 140 pounds for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm short for 140.
I want to get down to half a little.
And he's gonna have to go up to half a pound, and then we're gonna have a team.
That's what the fans want.
Let us set it up for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxo needs this one."
Climas asked whether the battle should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy to be followed by Lomachenko to lead his debut battle of 135 later this year in order to appoint for the next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0,30 Nocauts), which is also interested in fighting the winner of the race between Jorge Linares and Luc Campbell after their fight for the title of the champion of the world in the lightweight in the Forum on 23 September.
“The battle may be on the PPV because all the fans have been asked to do so,” said Garcia, expressing the willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready,
Garcia said that Lomachenko considered it to be a “wonderful boxer” and could be visiting his Saturday.
But Lomachenko did not immediately screw Garcia up with commendation and said that in his opinion, the champion in three weights from Riverside looked “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you've been asking for a knockout.”
Garcia said he was focusing on showing the force of the blow and then boxing.
They both said they'd feel the tensions in front of their own beating.
“This fight has to take place.
No other battles are so interesting and controversial.
"I am more than happy to work for him," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for someone of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great battle."

New test results have been published to assess the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the Swedish asylum-seekers tests under the new method of age medical assessment show that more than 80 per cent of the protesters have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all have been assured of the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized that it was unable to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic medical agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were estimated to be 18 years old or older, and another 25 cases of the forensic agency estimated that the test was “likely 18 years or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the opinion read that the person was “likely less than 18”.
Tests are conducted only when the age of the person is doubtful.
According to Johan Görnsson, a forensic medical agency, the results correspond to the results in the past months.
“We have not seen a great difference in statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he said to the portal “The Local”.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as aged 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “the most likely age of 18 or more years tested”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person had publicly stated that 18 had been accomplished this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of the age to make the teeth of wisdom and the volume of the knee joints and to give them to analysis to dentists and X-rayologists has also led to criticism in some institutions.
One of the skeptics is the endocrineologist at the Caroline Institute of Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have been sexually created earlier or later than normal.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the measurements that are being used.
Biological age is therefore very inaccurate.
If we cannot determine it with confidence, we should not pretend to be able,” he said to the Metro.
However, Gersensen of the Forensic Medical Agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of adopting a child as a minor is wrong.
We are at the greatest risk when a person is about 18 years old, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'll see if I can run for the president.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin was ready to think if he was going to stand for the Russian President's election in 2018, “Interfax”.
This statement was a response to the request made by the residents of the village of Cheremushka in the area of Burat.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buratia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor asked Putin, "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we ask you, when the election of the President is next, we all ask you to meet again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," said the president in reply.
On 28 July, Dr. Peakov, President Dmitry, Spokesman of Russia, commented on the comments made by some media that Vladimir Putin ' s pre-election headquarters would be headed by the Presidential Director of the RF, Anton Weino.
Sands called these assumptions "nothing based, hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as no headquarters are available, before the headquarters are established, before the electoral campaign is far away," said the Peaks.
"Although it's on the agenda," said the Peaks.
Governor of Western Virginia stated that he would move to another party
Governor of Western Virginia, representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justis announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, who would move to another party.
“You like it or you don't like it, but the democrats have drifted away from me,” said Governor Justis.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... Today I tell you, the people of Western Virginia, that I can no longer be useful to you by staying a democratic governor.”
The meeting broke out with applause.
“This is tomorrow I will change my registration to a republican,” added Justis.
"As a coach, I would tell you the time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia meeting.
The Tramp won 42 per cent in Western Virginia, and Justis did not support the candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillari Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited a coal business from his father.
His condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the move of Governor Justis to another party is another strike on the Democratic Party, which is rather impeding than working to make our country again great”.
“As regards only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of state legislatures in history, the statement by Governor Justis is just another refusal of a party that does not have leaders from above downstairs and cannot find a positive, communicating message”, reported in CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDenial.
Mr. Krasawczick found a house thanks to social nets.
A pilot in Pittsboro (Northern Carolina, U.S.A.) built a cat named Mr. Krasawczic with a weight of more than 14 kilograms after he became famous because of the Internet.
That's what Mashable says.
At the end of June, a cat photograph was published in Facebook's accompany at the end of June, because it was clearly someone who had been feeding him before.
In comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could be a new memorial.
The publication received more than 3.2,000 rabbits and 15,000 commentaries.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr. Krasovczyk.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview on the WNCN radio, a U.S. woman said that she had such experience: she took home a cat of about 10 kilograms, and he now weighs a little over five pounds.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to a cat from Australia with very long legs.
The post with the image of the animal has collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she would be able to make a career in model business.
Coe commended Russia's “very” apology for the Doping scandal
The International Athletics Specialist, Sebastian Coe, commended on Thursday what he described as a sincere apology on the part of Russia for the doping scandal but reiterated that it was now inappropriate to allow the country again to participate in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of the Federation of the Light Athletics, Dmitry Pathin, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Self-Atletics, which was preceded by the World Championship on a light athlete, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who were stolen by gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Self-Attellic Federations voted for the continuation of the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of the use of doping financed by the State.
“I felt that today's response, today's report, were very sincere,” said President of the International Association of Light-Atletic Federations of Coe.
“All the council and all the Congress have enjoyed... that the Russian Federation itself will recognize that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing its utmost to ensure that the Federation is restructured.”
Koe said that he also “approved” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, which is not now the time to restore Russia's rights,” said Kow.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to settle this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the impoverished system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, consistent with the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Atomic Federations, will be under the neutral flag to participate in the peace championship on the light athletics that will begin on Friday in London.
The chairman of the special commission of the International Association of Light Atomic Federations, Runne Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements were still to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London following the report of the International Association of Light Atomic Federation Council, drug testing is still not done in enough amounts, but the dismissed coaches are still quietly doing their work.

Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The Patrol Ship “Commandante Borsini” entered Libyan territorial waters to halt the influx of illegal migrants, along with the Navy.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which did not control most of the country ' s territory.
The Libyan Parliament against the Cabinet and based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
The commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his subordinate orders to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was stated that they did not believe in these threats and that they intended to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations of the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan Cabinet Faiz Saraj, recognized by Europe.
The Italian authorities have launched a sea mission to combat illegal migration after the number of non-legals coming to the country from Libya was promulgated in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.

How the financial rules of football will affect Neyamara's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited losses on the part of European football clubs will not prevent the world record of Neyemar's transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint-German Paris.
Whatever the consequences may be further on the chain, for the Paris Saint-German, UEFA, the supervisor of European football, whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious tournament of the League of Championes.
From the Financial Fair-Play Rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the UFS will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neyamara was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Naymar would receive a salary that would reach tens of millions a year.
These are some of the financial aspects of Neimar's relocation to France.
The SPW can definitely dissolve to hire Neyar and add it to the galaxy of other stars, taking into account the financing of the team by the wealthy power of the ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the cost-effectiveness threshold in their football business.
The FPF introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs in huge debts in their pursuit of success were, in fact, cheating and risking destruction if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFCs stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abrahamovich in Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a world brand, has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period of 2018, clubs may have lost Euro30 million.
And even though Platini was disgracefully withdrawn from the presidential office in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to contain excessive spending.
The FPL seems to be alive, and we will move forward to tighten the rules,” said Andrea Traverso, an Associated Press last week, controlling the FP at UEFA.
While SPLM is paying a lump sum for Neyar contract, it can allocate this amount for the entire period of its contract.
Nymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as the cost of Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of the PFP sanctions in 2014, the SPW, as well as the Abu Dhabi Manchester City, had been subjected to severe sanctions.
ERP was fined Euro60 million (at that rate $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and it was ordered to limit the composition of its team at Liga Champions during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
UEFA tracks clubs that may attempt to overtake its financial inspections by dispersing its income from companies associated with the club owners.
Although the Qatar company could offer SPW, but if the funding amount was higher than the standard market rates, WEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014, when WEFA decided that the SPW funding from the Qatar Tourism Office had been disbanded.
It was reported that part of Neyar's earnings in the SPW could be made by the organizational committee of the 2022 peace championship in Qatar.
But SPG and Qatar 2022 deny that Naymar will be ambassador to the world's championship, and such a manoeuvre could easily be discovered by WEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the SPW mean that WEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by acquaintances, WEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with the SPW on the transfer of Neyamar.
They communicated with Associated Press on anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the SPL.
According to the latest published report, ERW gained more than 10 million euros from the turnover of Euro542.4 million in 2015 to 1016.
Reports for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
SPW expects Neyar's arrival to be a conducive ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and t-shirts with the logo of the team.
The club assumes that it will grow at least 30 percent as a result of the recruitment of a new player.
Undoubtedly dissatisfied with the departure of one of the best soccerists, the Spanish League tried to prevent Neyemar's transfer, stating that the SPG would break the financial “Feir-Play”.
“This is an obvious case of “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” stated President La Liga Havier Tebas, in the Spanish newspaper, bearing in mind that Qatar is the final owner of the SPW.
Arsenala trainer, Arsen Hunger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnatu, shares the La League's doubts about the financing of the State club.
“It's all the consequences of share, and it's completely changed the landscape of soccer over the past fifteen years,” said Hungarian on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's going to be very difficult to observe the financial feud because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of oath will determine the President
Where and as new Russian citizens pledge their commitment to the RF, the President will decide on such amendments to second reading in the relevant law to establish a committee of the General Assembly on Legislative and Publicbuilding.
Even a week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order in which to make an oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacity, and the revised text of the amendments to the “Citizenship of the RF” Bill (the “Evidence”), which will be considered by the Committee on 11 July before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of oathing the citizenship of the RF in place of formal signature of documents on 6 June during a meeting with Speaker of the Lord Vyacheslav Voldynim.
Deputies have introduced this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the Bill to repeal the decision on the extradition of nationality to those who have subsequently been convicted for a number of terrorist or extremist crimes, for example, for public appeals to terrorism or for public acquittal in the media or on the Internet (art. 2, para. 205.2 of the Criminal Code), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 211, art. 211 of the Criminal Code).
According to the Bill, the logic of the law was that by making the documents for citizenship, the person was signed under the promise of compliance with Russian law, which violated the promise of extremism.
The draft law was introduced in April by leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasilla (“Single Russia”), Hennadia Züganov (CRC), Vladimir Girinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov (“Righty Russia”) and Speaker GD Vyacheslav Voldin.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the State and Legislation Committee approved the text of the bill for second reading, but it has been revisited.
It now states that the order of making the oath will be established by the President of the RF.
Previously, parliamentarians were about to describe the procedure directly in the “Citizenship of the RF” Act, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere before the State herb and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place, the list of locations where the guerba RUF could be located is governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the Cabinets of Heads of State of State, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive branches, etc.
Most likely, this could be the GTA.
A solemn oath will be given to those wishing to obtain the nationality of the RF once the officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport is to be given only after the oath is made from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath must be preceded by the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will vow from the age of 18 and not from 14.
A rule was retained that the oath would be freed from incapacity or limited capacity, as well as those who could not pronounce, read or sign the oath on their own.
In addition, the President of the RF has the right to be freed from this procedure and “other persons”
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian bearers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an appropriate declaration to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarily certified copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
The waiver of “extraordinary” nationality, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided by an international treaty or if it cannot be “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
A group of deputies proposed an amendment to the law, including the first Vice Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CRC), Natalia Polinski, Paul Krascheninnikov and Irat Farraov (all of which was “Single Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate with Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Consequently, very many people are waiting for their destiny on the nationality of the RF, explaining on the eve of the Judicial Committee on Statebuilding and Law, Paul Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not extend to those who wrote down “other” nationality and passed the previous passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for irresponsible reasons” did not cease to be considered a national of another country.
Aliens are now prohibited from serving in the municipal service, being recruited for facilities and organizations related to the security of Russia.
A person with dual nationality or residence permit of another country may not also become a member of the State of Justice or a member of the Federal Council.
It is envisaged that the law should enter into force as of 1 September 2017, and the necessary regulations should be prepared at that time.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in the "Jark American summer" and "Trade detective"
The current termination of history, nostalgically reminds us of the famous days of the characters in the 1980s; the era of the boundary in the 1990s (approximately when the outstanding masters of David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a comedy of the State for MTV); and of themselves, in 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Benx, Amy Poller and Paul Radd, moved to more serious things.
As a fact of culture, it is both an uplift and an embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, she seems to be anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the Absurdist humor (including the original story of the bank-speaking vegetables that H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result is doubled by the chief joke: middle-age actresses play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood, thus making it impossible to return into a joke.
"Ten years later," where adults are already playing adults, they have less emotional roots, and their traitority is more unsystemable and includes reefs from stalker films of the 1990s, like "The Rocks, Killing Wheel."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller horses, and a bunch of other things since 1991.
Many plot moves are the same.
The Gentle Coop (Showolder), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Margerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has a virginity.
And there's also a crazy and subtle conspiracy, in which Ronald Reagan (such as Schowalter), who is now incited by George Bush-old (the tested parodia in the execution of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchisa is the derogation.
It's especially funny to see a young rad who's singing Matt Dillon's song from "One-neck" who's a character who's a big man named Andy now an old girl.
This franchise could be successful by random madness in the spirit of a recursive series "Seven Up" until it came to a logical conclusion, I think, "The Wonderful American summer: Twenty Years Later" where the last stage would be a film for the Premier of the Worship American summer.
The detective's in the Amazon speaks to another kind of nostalgia: memories of the cold war of the Americans, the Explosive Blondie, or even Blosska with its image of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gaitwood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Ris Thomas, depicts a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s on two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninian path.
The main roles -- the life of Gregor and the idealist Josef -- are Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelio Ulyz, and their dialogues are in English by Chenning Tatum (he is the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levet.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the police spend time watching a chess match like the Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the frame, including Jenny Sleit, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevinya, makes it interesting to play the "record the voice."
But "Translator Detective" holds for the truthfulness of an advertising drama -- there's even a killer in the Ronald Reagan mask -- which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are lengthened, and it's not very funny.
If it were to be made shorter, the "Development of a detective" could better deal with its amateur in the spirit of an agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, two fat men sitting in the billboard, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
The imaginary Communist viewer, this image says western culture is capable of doing anything to make obese.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not that wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them, too.
The prize fund for the Russian Supercube for Soccer between Spartacus and Lockomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Prime League (RFPL) by Sergei Pradkin for a press conference.
According to the head of the FRF, the winner will receive 70% of that amount, reports the RT.
He also added that to date there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotive match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
According to TACS, Spartak is an active champion of the RC, and Lockomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young men cleaned the furniture chain by 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old Finnish, with a furniture firm, visited the police day.
The man stated theft of expensive tools from the chain, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The mining of thieves became tools of nearly 200,000 roubles: two welding appliances, perforator, hydraulic, slab.
The security of order began to search for criminals and soon came to the Bashkortostan community of 23 and 24 years old.
According to the media service in the Republic, the accomplices penetrated the businesses, hacked the front door and delivered the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first crashing car service.
Theft has already been initiated, and law enforcement has been able to return only a portion of the stolen tools to the legal owner.
The Lord commented on the words of Medvedev on the relationship between the RF and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Heather Naurt in response to the words of Prime Minister F. Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two States.
Previously, the head of the Russian Government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the FM a full trade war.
Commenting on these words, Naurut acknowledged that Russian-American relations were “low-level”, but noted that it was necessary to seek “unity areas”.
"Look at the truce in south-west Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the U.S. and Russia," quotes the words of the diplomat RIA Newsty.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on a statement made by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The new Bill of Sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, U.S. President Donald Trump, signed the last Wednesday.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grows" roses from amethists and quartz
The French fashion house's Yuvelar unit Dior - Dior Joailerie - filled the collections of Rose Dior Bagatel and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three chicken on the bark tapes.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan offers two new rings and a box of amethists, pink quarts and diamonds performed in gliptic techniques (manual stone rings) and pavement and on the 70th anniversary of the house.
Head Dior Joaillerie Victoir de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew in their place in Grannville modeler Christian Dior, and the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
Trump found perpetrators of deteriorating relations with Russia
The U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented and dangerous level.
"Can you thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed before Donald Trump.
They will, inter alia, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement stating that the law would not allow the US to enter into profitable transactions and would further draw the RF, China and North Korea closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to purchase the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbanka
A businessman from Belarus, Victor Procopenja, revoked a request from the National Bank of Ukraine (NLB) for purchase of a Sberbanka daughter's unit.
The businessman's decision explained to the RBC the intention to “concentrate on other our planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step would be “a better investment of time” despite the investment attraction of Sberbanka's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main claimant for the purchase of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov consortium and the Belarusian company Said Guzerieev in July.
The Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after Peter Poroschenko imposed sanctions on their daughters in March.
Sberbank was one of such financial organizations, other than the ITC and the External Economy.
Novak called the cause of the blecauth in Crimea.
In the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Energy called the cause of the Blecauth in Cruma.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of the incident.
He said that the peninsula had been left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Reddam region.
The truck in the accident struck the line of electric transmission, resulting in the disconnection of Cuban and related criminal networks.
The electrical accidents of large criminal cities were recorded last week.
Specialists have eliminated turmoil within hours.
It was initially reported that abnormal heat could be caused by the blecout.
The Bank of England will maintain interest rates at 0.25 per cent
The Bank of England is expected to later declare that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and diminishing inflation have caused rumors of possible increases to cease.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unabated and left the interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank ' s Cash Policy Committee (MPC) voted, with a result of 6 to 2, for maintaining the rates of 0.25 per cent, and this month, the fewer members expressed their support for the increase in the rate because weak economic growth had weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while it was still expected that inflation would rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that the increase in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the bracketed inflation, and said that it was likely that the costs of loans would have to be higher than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of relinquishing the part of the large set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of the brandit.
Since next February, the bank will close the emergency funding plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it is now in the framework of this plan to provide an additional 15 billion pounds, up to 115 billion pounds.
In the report on the decision on rates, the bank said: “Basic MPC forecasts that the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while the pressure on real income of families continues to affect consumption.”
On the question of rates, he reiterated that, in order to stop inflation, a “slightly tightening of financial policies” would be required in a small amount than the markets expected.
Currently, markets predict the first rise in the third quarter of the following year and another increase in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “steady” and “restricted”.
The projections of the bank for this and the next year are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has maintained its projection of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
Pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after the recent unsatisfactory growth rates had diminished the higher expectation; GDP had then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth seems to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it starts to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank ' s last inflation report gave little cause for the joy of households whose inflation was high and low wage increases: the bank said that the pressure would increase before declining.
The Bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” earnings in the next few years, but expects that wages “significantly” will be restored by the end of its three-year projection.
The economy is also determined to increase as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low pound rate, which will compensate for part of lower consumption costs.
A year after the last August, the rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the referendum on the issue of exit from the European Union resulting in the fall of the pound.
The bank estimates are likely to take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision at rates, there was a rise in noise around the projected increase in rates, as inflation had pressured households with severe pressure, and the three committee experts asked to increase the rates to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the past month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is fully a result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Koreko Ipotics brokers, said: “If you take into account the recent fall of swap courses, it appears that the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and look forward to a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable for those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as credit refinances, often with the possibility of a lack of commission and with a low rate, become more popular than ever.”
The Public Health Service will rewrite the controversial HIV drug of 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for the prevention of HIV after the battle of the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposition prevention of HIV (PREP), a pill taken before sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infected persons at an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three-year test period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the appeal court had upheld last year ' s decision of the High Court, which asserted that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PREP, despite its allegations that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) described it as a“veraging moment”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England, by April 2018, the venerological dispensers in London, Bryton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to register people, and even more dispansers will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposition prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-infected HIV-infected.
Research shows that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When PREP is adopted before sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be used daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to a drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and are not successfully treated.
Dispensers will select suitable participants, including men, women, transgenders and people whose partners are unknown to know whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and attributed to a doctor of common practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme would cost 10 million pounds, and the British National Health Service signed a drug contract this week after an international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PREPs for collecting clinical data on who the drug is targeted, how much the drug is absorbed and used.
“This most important innovation must complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone over more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, NAT President, National AIDS Control Office, stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is written to target people in need of help and at risk, gives the opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at the HIV risk group will have access to a new means to which a person can control without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to a lot of better lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrens Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, it is necessary to ensure that the test is quickly launched throughout the country and that no HIV risk is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with a pilot drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
The Shadow Minister of People's Health, Sharon Hodgeson, said: “We welcome the commencement of the PREP test, it has been very late for months of delay and provocation by the Government.”
Data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this rocky infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the advantages of the PREP.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and move us to a step towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatar adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The sixth meeting of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution which noted the importance of the continued presidency in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a well-recommended form of the organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
The Congress also stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the distinction between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and social-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that the treaty between Moscow and Kazanya was concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the Deputies of Gossoweth Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only subject of the federation who has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called the President.
In Russia there were difficulties in obtaining international driving rights
The units of the GIBD are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IAS).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait for a few weeks, which is a real problem for vacationers wishing to leave abroad on their car or to take it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The MLC was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on specific police officers or a rolling office: some require MLCs, while others require sufficient national rights.
To be insured, drivers of international law still receive, but it should be borne in mind that, in non-ratification countries (e.g. the United States, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities are entitled not to recognize national rights or the IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in virtually all units of the GIDD, reports Commersant ' in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the HIGIDD units, the talons are simply not issued, and the band is not enough for four months.
You can write to the public service site, but it's already stretched up until mid - August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the MOU cannot be obtained “for technical reasons” without giving in detail, in the Samaria area honestly say that there are no forms, and the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Moscowians have already faced the problem, and social media reports are increasingly reported:
Irena Burmistrova, "Recognise why in Moscow no international law is available?"
That's right, 'cause all the GIDD offices are out of form.
Elena Podkolzina: "Quite to knowing people!"
International rights must be acquired very urgently.
In Moscow, the talons are always far ahead, and there are no talons on the ground (the button is, but the talon can't give it).
It would seem like the public portal shows that in the SpB the free time before the fig.
Has anyone been receiving in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the Gosauto Inspectorate.
This may also be linked to a deficit, but it is not clear what changes are involved before.
Blanks procure a special purpose centre for road safety (OBDC) and then ship them to the HIPD units.
In recent years, all contracts had been contracted with AO “Convenience”: in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 MOU forms had been manufactured, 15,000 forms had been purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract had been concluded on 18 July with the GSO “First printed yard” for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that CNS just didn't have a time-consuming tender, and that's why there's a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel to more cheap Asian countries, China, Thailand, and so on.
What rights are being adopted there, to the end, is not clear, so people are reinsurance, and therefore there is an influencing demand for international shorts.
Recently it was known that professional drivers would have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
That suggestion was made by Mintrans.
The international driver ' s certificate (IMS) of the new specimen has been in operation since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Kram Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's capacity to build a bridge in Krum.
On Friday, 4 August, he said in an interview to the portal, the Diseaser.
No respecting international company would even put a chat or a chase there, because it would risk losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that had acceded to the sanctions against Russia concerning the Crimea.
"That is my deep conviction that the project does not actually have any prospects," said Petreenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build smaller sites.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
“I believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so inappropriate to join the project,” said the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the arch of the Kram Bridge.
A large assembly of the Kram road arch of the Krym Bridge is completed on the quirkshore, which is locked at an altitude of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“Sometimes bridge builders have prepared for the installation of the rail arch on the fairway walls”, reported at the project's information centre.
In April, Head of Mintrans Maxim Sokoval informed President Vladimir Putin of the construction of the site in advance of the schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Kram peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, an official who had not been employed for 10 years was dismissed
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was the head of the Spanish official, Carles Recio?
Permanent stroll stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not your direct boss.
Nothing else in the bureaucracy world can happen.
Origins seem to have been used to all the "servants of the people."
Nevertheless, officials have been able to surprise those whose taxes they live on all the time.
This time, "censation" was complaining from Spain.
There, a Valencia Carles Recio archive officer had worked for ten years without going to work.
At the same time, he received regular reparations.
The whole thing is 50,000 euros a year.
And here's Mr. Recio's "wonderful Times."
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it was found that the vicious walker had come to office every working morning at 7:00 each morning to observe in the electronic system.
I went home immediately.
Once again, he was in work at 4:00 p.m. to remark in the system that he had left.
It's ten years.
It was also known that all the free time the walker spent drawing comics in the home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are now thinking about how to punish Mr. Recio directly, who could not fail to know how to “actually work” in his workplace.
Judges are invited to protect against the chairpersons
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRR), on instructions from Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
HRW proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts and to introduce their choices.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRD wishes to establish special districts that will not be linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential commission.
The HR Committee has finalized proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with members of the Council.
The meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of judicial misconduct, as well as issues of public control in the places of detention (see UN of 9 December).
The outcome of the work of the HRT was 25 proposals relating to both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlev human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the chairpersons of the courts to improve the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for a judge has been successfully competed and received the support of the judicial community, the President of the court is of the opinion that he should be present to his appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to distribute cases among judges.
To do so, experts are allowed to do so, and may be a specially written computer program.
The President also believes that he is not entitled to “prejudge the results of the qualifications of the judge, initiate his disciplinary responsibility, and decide on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “elections of judges themselves” and to “condition their powers for a relatively short period of time with mandatory rotation”.
All Presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the district) are now appointed by the President for six years upon submission by the President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HR Committee proposes a new appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The HRT states that “the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation is required, not at the regional level of the judiciary in the RF, but in the judicial districts.”
Experts base the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “trial districts” that do not coincide with administrative divisions in the RF, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials whose use of “telephone law” is difficult.
The world judges of the HRW propose that people be strengthened to deal with some “category of civil and administrative matters” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"This is just our proposals," explained the U.S.A. member of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamara Morshakova.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only HR, but also to the Supreme Court (VC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still a time to perform the assignment of the BC (in the middle of the co-executors - Genocura and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the FM).
To report to Vladimir Putin how effective the independence of justice is being ensured in the FM, President Vyacheslav Lebedev is due until 1 September.
Live a high life: Halfway and cunning designers turned this little apartment into Earls Cort into a space dwelling.
Joan Lee, a former banker engaged in real estate repair, moved from a space house in Nittsbridge to an apartment in Earls Cort in 2014.
The apartment's on the first floor of a nice model house in Queen Anna's style, and in favour of a new design, it says that Joan didn't gather her things and didn't move again.
“Now I lived with my ex in Nightsbridge in a much larger area, ” says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Cort, and there were the same high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered the price on the same day."
Since the first view of the apartment, a full renovation of 1,000 square feet has been carried out.
Initially, it was an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning — to get into the bedroom, we had to go through the kitchen — and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and a semi-stage to get the best out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“ I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Erphan Azadi from the Notting Hill architecture and design studio “Duck & Shed” to use ceilings of 12.5 feet high and to create a housing that would not only be a successful project but would be worth Joan for life.
The ceiling was not enough to build two spaces over one another, so the architectural task was to create a semi-stage where a full growth could be achieved.
Erphan had to think creatively to cope with the briff.
“The work with steel is very complicated,” he explains.
“We had to place spaces so that they would stay on top of each other, and we would not have to swallow up.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to extinguish designs so that they would be at the right height and allow spaces to be used from top to bottom.”
This decision allowed Erphan to set up two full-fledged rooms over one another in a fixed space — and much more interesting.
From the semi-emergence through a vintaged copper light from Retrouvius, a view of a silly hotel is opened downstairs.
Star furniture with gold, silver accents and vintage lighting appliances from Serge Muy provide a project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacularity, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirror boxes are used to store all the dishes of Joan.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can bare the kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the kitchens that make up.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a door that moves upstairs like in the garage.
"It was engineering here," Erphan's story about an armored steel wood-walled shield door.
"She's equipped with an anti-weight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
With the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the sex area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be,” says Erphan.
“In fact, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations on the basis of the gender area.”
Here they were able to increase the gender area using qualitative materials that provide the area of luxury.
“The material is what we're touching, so they're helping to create an emotional relationship with the house,” says Erphan.
“No one is in love with the electric wire in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't strike the strings of our hearts."
It's evidence that with a good design and an increased subway of the apartment, it can turn out of something normal into something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian Government approved the establishment of a commission on public cultural policy.
The decision was issued on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The chairman of the Commission has been appointed Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the RF, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy strategy in 2016 until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries declined to a minimum of eight years
The increase in consumer prices in G20 countries has decreased to the minimum values over the past eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Previously Rostat reported a decrease in the consumer price index of 0.1 per cent in Russia.
Thus, the deflation of the first weekly period in 2017 was recorded by the agency.
Inflation Target in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, however, believes that the target has already been achieved, according to the agency, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal cutting of Baikala taiga
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on environmental development in the Baikal territory, warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donski, noted that a bill had been drafted earlier.
It allows the deforestation of forests during the removal of fires, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored to ensure that, in the process of deleting, "nowhere is all cut out."
Donski noted that the bill entailed monitoring by the CDM and oversight agencies.
The media: VSO fighters are secretly contracted with the Donbas militia from the command
A regular telephone line in Donbassa has been established on the line of armed confrontation.
The warriors of the opposing parties are constantly interacting with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The VSL and the Donbas militia have established cell phone communication secretly from their high command.
This is reported on 4 August by Strana.ua with reference to the military operations in Donbas.
According to the publication, units commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily on telephone.
Communication is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Part of the result of such conversations is the truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists were aware of the cases in which an officer received congratulations on the day of birth from his formal enemy on the front line.
The GSS and the DNR and LNR militias have been sitting in the trenches on the border line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbassa.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs disappointed the blocking of UNSC attacks on the Embassy of the RF
In the Russian Foreign Political Department, the actions of selected Western diplomatic representatives that block the statements of the United Nations Sowbez in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Embassy of the RF in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
It was recalled that the Russian Embassy territory in Damascus was subjected to mortar attacks on 2 August three times a month by terrorist groups, Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (former Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the RF) and Filec Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is united in the qualifications of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSB resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the MID RF noted that “it would appear, in itself, that the Nusra terrorist attacks should face general unconditional and strong condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessment of leaks against diplomatic missions”.
However, as emphasized in the Diplomacy, “even three times a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council have blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft summary statement of the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital.”
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“The most dismayful thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts encourages them to new provocations and terrorists, gives them a sense of impunity”, stated in the MID, and added that “it would not be like these barbarians to have a conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them at the same time.”
Vladimir Putin spoke for limiting the number of unplanned business checks
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, during the investment project meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of unplanned entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of planned inspections, and said that it was necessary to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
“Official checks are normally carried out without the relevant agreement with the Public Prosecutor's Office; only 2 to 3 per cent are in line with the Public Prosecutor's Office, everything else is being done on its own”, quotes the President of the TACS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should not be allowed to remove servers and rigid discs on businesses.
In addition, in the view of the President, business unions should be given the right to defend the interests of their members before the court.
“It is hopeful that it will make a positive contribution to business cases or to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship,” said the Head of State.
As reported by the U.S., the moratorium on planned inspections has led to an increase in the number of other types of business inspections.
In May, a survey was carried out by the President of Russia, Boris Titus, which revealed that the actual replacement of the planned audits had occurred in non-planning (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), the prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), the raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and the checks on citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
Detail of business checks in the U.S. material, "The small business has gone from the other side."
Brothers are fighting for a real estate value of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria, worth over 500 million dollars, 40 years after their Italian ancestors established a dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton soccer club and the builder, Colin de Lutis, live in the Turk palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him to the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still holding an aggravated dispute about the conditions of divorce.
With their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth over half a million dollars bought since their family bought a shop at Smit Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded a company called Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 points of trade.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family property list consists today of office buildings, sites under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, flats on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller and trade centres in suburbs.
In agreement with the deceased father, Colin, whose Paul describes as “the chief driving force and the dominant identity” of the de Lutis family, has about two thirds of the assets of the company, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money was a stumbling block for Paul.
"Divorce proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings were held before the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now controversial about who will control the existing business - of which, in Paul's view, Colin disfellowshipped him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of uncompetent management of certain objects.
In the evidence given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family to be the highest priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenditure is growing as a snowcom: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and the Charter of Keck Cramer; both sides attracted the most well-known lawyers, including the Royal attorney Allan Meyers, and the best strippers.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they had run dairy bars and hastronomers and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last class of school, and Paul was a boy at that time (approximately 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luiji often told me he didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the de Lutis company group; Colina says that Mark got 10 million when he got out of business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were “satisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to Eddie McGir, the best friend of television published in 2015.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Kolin replied, a text message stating that, since the case had not yet been tried before the court, “I don't really have anything to say.”
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a suit against me and to scratch the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he tried to meet the brother’s demands.
"Our father would not like to see how Paul and I disputed in court," he said, adding that "he still hopes to resolve the conflict."
That hope must have been dissolved on Friday.
"The decision in our case will be brought to justice soon," wrote Colin.
The new head of the Trump is planning to limit information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
In that case, he'll be the first.
“Politico” reports that the new head of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tempus, including news from the media, in hopes of keeping the Chief in a calmer state.
That's what the reporter Josh Dowzie reports.
“A meeting held by John F. Kelly, a new head of the White House, with the head of the office on his first day of work, he identified the main problem in the White House at President Donald Trumpe, which he hoped to decide: bad channels of information to the President.”
Kelly told the staff that the information should go through it, in paper or through briefings, because the President would be better to decide if he received the correct information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is quite correct, but others have already failed in trying to relieve the Tempa by tracking the receipt of information.
The relationship between President Trump and television a few decades ago, and now, when he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was resented by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to show him that he had been given fair coverage in the publications that could be reconciled," said Sam Nanberg, a former electoral headquarters adviser, in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote to the Politics that “the six former members of the electoral headquarters had to keep under control the Tempa habit of writing in Twitter to ensure that the information they received was a constant flow of praise.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter has ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe those members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if they weren't, the Trump tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff had spared him at least a few troubles, their efforts were not futile.
But no one has ever been able to keep the Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving the Tram material, whether reliable or not, which confirms their views.
The politician, just by this story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly give the President questionable information.
Consider an example described by reporter Shein Goldmaker:
"Non-existent and ex-Trump staff say that Trump can react very harshly to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm down until he finds who was behind them.
That's what happened at the end of February, when someone gave the President a print on the GotNews.com, a website of Charles K. Johnson's internet provocator, where the Deputy Chief of Staff, Kathy Walsh, was accused of being "standing behind a near leak" in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is forever beaten in Twitter for aggressive conduct, that he has not provided specific facts or that in the past he has filed false charges and then refused them.
The temp has read the article and has begun to question the staff members about Wells.”
Goldmaker adds that the then head of the Rynes Pribus and the secretary of Rob Porter were trying to build a system to manage and document the Trump's flow of papers.
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
He may be more effective manager than Pribus, but the Tramp still has impulsive nature, and his assistants continue to fight with each other for influence.
These constant factors make the task of Kelly very difficult.
The Tumen Public Prosecutor's Office fights with HIV dissident
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the decision of the Kalinini Tumeni Rajouse, which terminated criminal proceedings against a local resident whose HIV-related daughter died of a young child.
As a result, the child was killed because the mother was HIV-disciplined and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor considers that the crime cannot be left unpunished to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case of the Tumeni resident was initiated at 109 p.m. in April, after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection 4B.
According to the Procurator ' s Office, the mother is herself HIV-infected.
“Women did not treat herself and refused the treatment of her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection”, explained in the Tumen Procurator's Office.
The criminal case was filed in the Kalinini Rajsud Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl made this appeal, explained that “the woman has forgiven, she has no claim, she has quelled the harm and apologized”.
The Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and appealed, requiring the termination of the case and the resumption of it.
The girl died, and it is impossible to repair the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to survey the baby and treat her with dangerous infections”, reported in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
In the opinion of the supervisory body, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents would follow her example.
As reported at the Tuman AIDS Centre, some 12 HIV-positive children in Tumen are now not receiving medical care because of their parents' refusal.
"And this situation has improved -- in the year the ad hoc group's work, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their opinions -- have allowed the diagnostic and the use of drugs," said the Spokesman for the AIDS Centre, Elena Loiva.
She said that it was not possible to influence parents in legislation and that not all HIV-positive children were able to detect that mothers did not allow them to be investigated, hid, run away from hospitals.
The risk of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, Peterburg Sociologists presented the results of the first Russian study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Medicines and AIDS service NCBs call these views anti-medical, and they face a serious threat in their proliferation.
A terrible photo session that ended with a tragedy took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Khmelnik.
A cheerful company of elevated young people walked through a bridge over the railways, where the truck train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea of making an effective selphie on the roof of the wagon, and reported to the FACTAM in the police communication sector in the Kmelnik region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but his indifference led him to the line of electrical transmission and was instantly hit by a current.
Fortunately, this case was known to the station manager, who immediately caused an emergency.
Prior to the arrival of the victim, the doctors were moved to a safe place and then hospitalized to the Hospital of Hmelnicka in the district clinic.
The men diagnosed the torso burns of 1-2 degrees.
His condition is now regarded as stable.
Enforcements are reminded that in recent times extreme selphis on rooftops, bridges, and moving transport have become increasingly popular.
The police encourage people to be vigilant and to avoid such photosessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed oceans to exist in ancient Venus
Ancient Venus could have had oceans.
French scholars suggested that this would be the case.
Scientists have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the process of producing water on the planet, writes Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of its history, oceans were created with 10 per cent more water than now on Earth.
Previously, the Armuments of the Week reported that according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed 4 billion years ago on Mars.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were wounded as a result of shooting in the San Francisco Park
Three people were wounded in San Francisco and the Associated Press was handed over.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there was a large number of visitors.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting people.
The outward appearance of wrongdoers could not be considered because they had closed everything except their eyes.
Another medical assistance was provided, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, no details about his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were wounded during shooting at the night club in the town of Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured in attempting to leave the premises.

The Gypsies crossed the roars and returned to the Millionaire Street
Some of the most wealthy West Midland homeowners are again in conflict with the resolute Gypsies that have overcome the roamed municipal authorities in order to reopen the field next to their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on the wheelchairs in a field bordering the rich street of Solikhal, which was a jolly name for the streets of millions.
Having brought with them horses, infants, and many houses on the wheels, they returned after they were expelled not further than in May, and had not been prevented by the roams that the municipal authorities had dug to prevent their incursions.
This tactical company found a gap in defence facilities and ransacked its vehicles through an area that had not been fenced to leave the track.
The riots attacked the Municipality of Solikhal, saying that he was “unable to solve the problem”.
The anonymous local resident said, "They came here on Monday night after they were driven from Bentley Hit, where they were scorching stones in the passersby."
Municipality should be disheartened and forced to act because they are totally unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and here they came back.
More gypsies came last night, perhaps even more today.
“The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like to see that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality cannot even put an end to it.”
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, “It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leaving the previous time, and please, this attack continues.”
This time they became more, and we even saw the horse feeding on the meadow."
The representative of the Municipality of Solikhalla stated: “We know of the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbruk Road and cooperate with the Solikhal police; we take the necessary legal action to drive them as soon as possible”.
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many local residents report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by telephone 101 as possible.
This allows for an understanding of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Champagne wine plant "New Light"
The GUP of the Republic of Krym “The Envoy of the Champan Vines of the “New Light”” is decided to share, converting to the OAO “The Envelope of Champanian “New Light””, followed by the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Krima Anna Annuhino.
100 per cent of the shares of the business will remain in Krum State.
The statutory capital of the shareholder society will be 595.5 million rubbish, consisting of 5,955 million common shares with the nominal value of 100 rubbish each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Krima stated that if there were no funds to modernize the factory over the next three years, there would be a threat of stopping the plant.
The disbursement of major funds in the enterprise is between 60 and 70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion roubles to be modernized, and due to organizational and legal features it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of the revenues to the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"Taking money from the owner is problematic, talking about the leverage of large credit organizations," said the Minselhos Crym Sergei Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the projection plan for privatization in 2017.
It was suggested that it should be stocked and traded.
The source of Interfax in the authorities of Crima estimated the possible value of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investor's investment in the modernization of another $30 million.
New Light increased the production of grievous wines in 2016 by 2.8 per cent compared to the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by the prince Lviv Golitzin as a factory for producing the iron wine of the new world’s acquired name.
The plant is located at 11 acres [11 ha] of land.
Suburban third graders destroyed more than 40 tombs
The Ministry of Internal Oversight Services in the Low City area has identified the identity of citizens who have destroyed 46 graves at the Lishko cemetery.
Atrocities were the third - grade students.
The first statement that the cemeteries were damaged by unknown plates was received in the Russian OICA in the LISK region on 27 June.
A total of 24 people have been contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Enforcement, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found suspects, two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments fell, and that prompted them to do hooligan acts.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is increasing the tone of NGO ships that save migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that belonged to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities,” said the Minister of the Interior of Mario Minnita in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper Stampa.
Minni's warning was issued the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rette, suspected that his crew was actually collaborating with traffickers and facilitated illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for a year, had renounced substantively the detailed charges made against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrodo Cartozio.
“For us the salvation of human life is and remains the highest priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone,” says the social media statement.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now put forward, only after we have collected all the information and we can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Jugend Rette vessel since October.
His crew was suspected that he had taken a whole lifeboat on board migrants directly sent to them by traffickers and allowed smugglers to leave with the boats they could reuse.
At least one such meeting was projected to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, as alleged in the charges published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities who control rescue operations in the area, rather because of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct presupposes, primarily, that the Juventa courts will be held on board a member of the Italian police who will monitor their activities.
As yet, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations agreed to comply with the code: “Get out of children”, MONAS Maltese and Pro-Activa Pro-Proproprospertty Campaigns from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary, but acceptable, provided that they did not affect any “significant changes or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize Organization “Physicians Without Borders” (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minni said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants coming to Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal safety and to cooperate with local mayors were fruitful.
"In the last days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the RF have recently intensified their policies in Libyan direction, and delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have become part of visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal Libyan settlement of the MID RF and the Gosduma, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Moneygov, described the “U” goals that Moscow pursues in the region and on whom the bet is making.
The contact group on Libya, which you lead, is almost unknown.
So, let's say the Ukrainian contact group -- everybody knows about it.
And there's a cover of secrets.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was established on the initiative of the MID RF and the State Duma.
Its activities are governed by the Foreign Commander Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in Libyan direction by the Speaker of the Lord of Vyacheslav Voldinim.
The detention of the Russian tanker Mehanic Chebotarev in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We thought about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military professionals, the representatives of the Lord, had been established, and our work had been supported by Chechnya Ramsan Kadirov, head of Chechnya.
How did it turn out to be your leader?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to take the lead in the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the liberation of sailors from Mehanic Chebotarev.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups confronting each other in the Libyan conflict - and on the side of Tripoli (where the UN-recognized Government is headed by Faiz Sarajem. - " € " ) and with Tobruk (the Parliamentary Resolution that is opposing the Government and supports Marshal Khalif Haftar, which controls the eastern parts of Libya. - " US " ).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice-premier of Libya-United States), we were able to agree quickly on the liberation of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to establish a contact group to make better use of these contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya, we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict, we have a dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience in the force structures, including in the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to join the Team of Specialists on the region, representatives of the RAN Institute of the Middle East.
No one is permanently in Libya from our staff, and that is not necessary.
Whether there are Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now.
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All talks and publications about this are not valid.
But your contact group is included by the former military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot points.
Or such closed cities for us as Misurata (where militia units are based) that have played a role in overthrowing the Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and are notablely intensified in subsequent years.
We came to Misurata in January this year.
We were scared, we were told that everything was Islamist, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for why such rumors go, which is actually the role of Islamists there.
In Misurata, we met with all representatives of the IG detonation in Sirte (in December 2016, the city on the Mediterranean Coast was defeated by militia banned in Russia by the Islamic State - U.S.).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to verify that they played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalif Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion have you reached?
The Islamic State in Libya won no Haftar?
It wasn't him.
Haftar was operating on another front, in Bengazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, there were structures under the Government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited the people who had conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they arrived -- the visit continued from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was accepted by the Federation Council, Duma, MID, and Rosgwardia.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and are likely to be in the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire arrangements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris, Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saraj, could be implemented?
Or, again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be terminated, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar had agreed to another meeting has been a good signal for us, not long ago was not possible.
In the recent past, both leaders were very negative on each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on that day on board the Russian Airport Admiral Kuznets.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurat, they did not believe in coincidence.
They said, "You must be very courageous people who came to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key players in the Libyan conflict.
You and Haftar were communicating.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's relative.
But what we have learned, of course, makes dialogue with him easier.
And not only with him, among other things.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet the generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here's what they say in Russian.
And they're going to get to Russia, to some extent they're experiencing nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the likely abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
Of course, we are interested, but, as I have said, we do not take sides in this conflict or want to arm others at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in some equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyan people have consistently called for Russia to help withdraw it.
Libya is now actively pursuing the process of drafting a constitution.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions, and that there will be an internal consensus.
The elections that Saraj and Haftar had also been discussed should then be held.
If elections are held and finally elected by legitimacy (and no party currently has such status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations Union.
To raise this issue now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
On the day in the media, it was reported that Italy, which faced the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned to the destiny of EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation, using its relationship with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the Haftar troops to control the coast and to put an end to the smuggling business of immigrants in Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the south.
In that regard, tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is it to have the South chased the flows of migrants in far-reaching ways?
So, in a sense, the buses that the Nigerian migrants ride were turning back?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope, however, to help combine the South in the negotiating process between Sarajem, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of Government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of sharia rules in the country.
How radical is it?
Would that not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll express my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he's the opponents of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself maintains that Libya must be a perfectly normal country, a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he also actively fights against terrorists.
Where did he get this reputation?
It was established by those countries that were not interested in Russia's communication with Tripoli.
The Tripolis is the capital, and there is a legislative, executive and judicial power.
There, a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not getting there.
And we mixed them all and started actively communicating with Tripoli and Tobruk.
We are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosenifty has concluded a cooperation agreement with the State oil company Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnifty Igor Sechin made a deal, directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of the Libyan oil company Rosneft.
What will Russia do to her?
I suppose I'm reselling.
And what are Russia's economic interests in Libya?
In plans to re-sign contracts concluded at Muammar Kaddafi.
These include previous arrangements in the transport sector (laughing), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Is there anything for the Libyans to pay?
Well, they have oil.
I mean, as with Iran, is the oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't really do these questions.
Actually, Russia's economy is not important in Libya.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping.
The main thing for us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree between themselves so that they can establish order and that Libya ceases to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libyan people and destroying terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence of radical fighters in Libya (now or before) from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that to date there was no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of the Islamic and radical groups (Libya).
And from what States are those militants?
I don't want to take these details into account.
Then we'll make the question different.
How many of the Islamic militia fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, not more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks like Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are engaged in active talks with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our readiness to return to Moscow or the Grozny.
When can such talks be negotiated?
It's hard to say.
There are still several visits to be made, and I hope there will be clarity about the time and venue of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, charities collected money for a expensive gift to a sick boy.
A nine-year-old son, Sasha Mazola, who has a brain hydrocephalia and a full blindness, will be given a special runway on 5 August.
A useful presentation is made by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region, Oksan Kosarev, and the director of the Museum of Constant Bobkov.
The money for the coach was gathered during the charitable marathon, "Don't stand to do good," which was held in Melihov on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chechov.
Before the marathon in the museum, I received a letter from Sashi, who lived in the village of Manuchino of the Czechov district, saying, "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked Mom to write that letter."
"I'd like to get a present on the runway to make my feet strong, and I'd learn to walk a little."
Sashina's dream has come true!
Following the entrance to the Concerting Post-Scriptum Museum, a well-deserved Russian artist Alexander Gindin will perform poпурs from popular classical works.
During the charitable marathon in Melihov, the choirs of the Visennes David Desert, called by the Student of Elijah Drozdichin, P.I. Chaikovsky and Russian Academy of the name of Gnesini, the artists of the Melikhov theatre of the Chechov Studio.
Auctions were conducted for visitors, book fairs and charitable sales of souvenir products with the marathon logo.
The Melihovo Museum Reserve took the initiative to make the Czech Memorial Day on 15 July a single day of charity in all the Museumskia.
A 30-year-old resident of Oliveska Zitomira, near the local football stadium, fired several shots in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was insulted by noise, reported by FACTAM in the Zhitomiri Police Communications Division.
Then the man entered a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict in which a man used a rubber bullet shooting device to wound one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
At the scene of the incident, police officers and rapid medical assistance were arrived, but the shootings had been hid by now.
The law enforcement agencies established his identity and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullet shooting device that was sent to the test.
In this case, criminal proceedings have been initiated under article 296 (Huliganity) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
Detention is threatened for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Remember, a shooting attack took place in Kiev, Luqjanovka, in the area of the Tatarska Street, on the night of 28 July.
Michel Carter's verdict for reports that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
The Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for having been prompted by text messages and telephone calls to suicide by her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months of her life behind the crack and another five years of the test.
Carter was found guilty of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, which killed himself on 13 July 2014.
His father, Roy, said at the hearings on Thursday, "My family is sad.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain on his leave before the appeal.
She was at the risk of a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy were suffering from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red trousers and cream blouses, listened to the sentence of standing, shaking her hands, and putting her eyes down.
“In her own actions she killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor declared to the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But attorney Carter stated that it was a "tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant impact on her actions”.
The prosecutor read the statements of Roy Linn Roy's mother, which says, "No day has elapsed when I would not have mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of the way I do my best - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Kamdin Roy said she was incessantly pursuing the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become aunt of his children.
"Hallowing the man who has always been with me since my birth is the pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case would seem to be a legal precedent, since in Massachusetts there was no law that provided for the responsibility to advise a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was suicidal to Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in a few messages sent two weeks before he died when he rested with his family.
She wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You just have to turn the ignition on, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monice said that Carter wanted to gain attention through the death of Roy and forbid her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for murdering her British apartment neighbour in Italy and acquitted two years later.
A 30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in Los Angeles, saying, "Missel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prisons."
Eugenius Bogochev, "I let Langford go like a high-flight bird."
A 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNITA.
The U.S. Defender ' s Defender ' s Evgenius Bogochev commented on the President of Unicus Evgeny.
Keith made this decision on family circumstances, and Eugenius Bogochev told me.
He's got a little child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be close to the house.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played three seasons in UNITA and showed a high level in each match, all 100 per cent.
So I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and a play career.
Kit Langford played in the Casan Club for three years, gaining silver from the Single League 2015/16.
During season 2016/17, he was awarded the most effective player in the Eurolyga season.
He took 21,75 points on the average for a match.
The result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Euroliga, who received the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign the Chinese Shenchen contract, informing Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a 2-year-old contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second one in July of the Eurolyga star that goes to the Chinese championship.
Previously, Iannis Burusis moved to Chinese CBA, an ex-centre Panatenaicos.
A solar tourist from Pozmoskaya was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigay
Today, Adigay rescuers evacuated a mosquito tourist from the mountainous region with the strongest solar burns.
The man rested at the Fisht shelter at a height of 1.6,000 metres.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure and had difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescue manager of the tour group said that the man had received the burns in the camp.
Audio needs to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW stated that it would be proposed to update software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman stated that the company believes that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, with reference to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is located, which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Dimler stated on Thursday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies have described their step as a revocation.
European autoproducers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installation of equipment converting out of diesel cars is also increased and the competitive cost of cars becomes difficult to maintain.
While German autoproducers are under considerable attention, the Chancellor Government of Angels, Mercel, has also been accused of being acquitted by influential autoproducers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "chief devices" which, during testing, could adjust the number of emissions of harmful gases so that they conform to the rules and were disabled in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders were sentenced to trial the others on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, a former chief of thermodynamics department was arrested, consisting of an Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zakkeo Jovanni Pamio, Italian, and he's not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi undertook a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of establishing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously been concentrated on the United States.
The inclusion of Audio in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the producer of elite cars is a disproportionately high share of the “Folkswagen” income.
In Astrahani, the cafe visitor paid for false money
The police received a report from the bank ' s department of detection when recalculating the money from the perceptual point of the suspicious bill by 5,000 roubles.
A study at the Expert Criminalist Centre revealed that it was false.
According to UMVD of Russia in the Astrahan area, a visitor to a café purchased a bank note was paid.
It is worth noting that the cash was not equipped with the instrument of determining the authenticity of the buyers.
The police are currently establishing persons involved in the manufacture and marketing of a fake CBC ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services calls for attention to be given to financial transactions; traders are encouraged to establish instruments to verify the authenticity of money received.
The astronomers found an "Adian" planet on which even iron can melt.
The astrophysics, having first studied the properties of a giant exoplanet stratosphere called WASP-121b, were amazed at its temperature, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts pointed out that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that infrared radiation is emitted.
The Habble telescope captured the lighting of the water molecules on this gas giant: it's high temperature that makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet light in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot jupiteres" - gas giants, by size and mass, comparable to the largest planet of the Solar System, but tens of times closer to the parent star.
As a result, the exoplanet only lasts 1.3 “earth” days, and its gas shell is filled to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the provande.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now feared that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavunda has become worse because of dry weather and insect-borne diseases; this has led to the constant headache of scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years it has experienced the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the fall of rains has become much smaller.
This affects lavanda's lifetime.
And there are little zicadas that jump on the leaves of insects that carry microbacteria; in the very dry weather, they get very much."
There's a lot of at stake.
Lavunda does not only attract vacationers; lavender oil is very demanding in perfumeration and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "There are very long colts with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or no.
So we have fewer parts containing ether oil."
Decisions that are currently under consideration include improved water distribution and soil evaporation slowing, as well as plant spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water, and the production of drought-protected classes.
Ambassador of the Winter University 2019 met with red-school students
The twofold world champion on Hokkeya, Ambassador of Winter Universal 2019, Alexander Semine met on the eve of the start-up Hokkey, and gave autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held at Winter University 2019 in the thematic week of Hokkaya with Shaybo.
Any visitor of the tent could ride on horsebacks on an artificial ice site.
In addition, estaphets, victorins and games were organized with the souvenir products of student games and the aerobic federation.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Sémine advised the boys to take as much of their sports courses as possible and stressed that the most important element at the start of the training was hard work and the great desire to go to Hokkey.
"It's nice that Krasnoyarsk has a place like the Winter Universal Scotton 2019, where athletes can directly ask questions to team trainers," said the champion.
Let's note that promoting student sports and healthy lifestyles among redheads help the Ambassadors of the Winter University 2019.
Universal Shater will work throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University Directive 2019 press service.
The words of Medvedev were commented in Hosdeep.
The official representative of the U.S. State Department, Heather Naurt, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister F. Dmitry Medvedev, said that it was necessary to find “units for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to “better bilateral interaction”.
As an example of such successful cooperation, Nauratus referred to the Syrian Armistice Agreement.
We're two nuclear super-Powers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
Naurt refused to comment on Medvedev's claim for a full trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, she certainly has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of the Lord.
Previously, the U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill on the strengthening of sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the RF Medvedev stated that Washington had declared a complete trade war by ending the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that US sanctions would take place for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the U.S. researcher, "the pure winner" of the Tempa.
Missing Bodbilder in the Truck, they found a stranger who lost his memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very pinpoint circumstances, leaving the car to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully sought by acquaintances and locals.
There's Shamil on a foreign daughter in Ramen.
He was totally naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport disappeared.
Identification has helped to make an announcement of his disappearance.
Medicines coming on the phone recorded a partial loss of memory and a trauma trauma in Khanmetov, reports Pablik Mash.
The athletes are probably waiting for other surprises.
The evildoers who kidnapped Shamil probably had already been in his apartment, the keys from which he had also been stolen.
Oil-gas revenues in July exceeded projection of 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil-gas revenues received since July 2017 exceeded the estimate of RU 7.4 billion, reported by the Ministry of Finance.
The exceedance, as explained by the department, was largely the result of a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to a rouble compared with the average monthly value of June used for evaluation, as well as the excess of actual gas production and exports of the projected levels of petroleum products.
“The leakage of the federal budget from the monthly valuation in accordance with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 in the amount of +40.2 billion roubles,” says the report of Minfina.
Thus, the aggregate amount to RU 47.6 billion for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of a foreign currency would amount to RU 2.07 billion.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Minfin of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the CB will enter into foreign exchange transactions in the Mosk Exchange trades, even during the business day.
Acquisitioned foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury Accounts at Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly Riodose newspaper usually meets on the environment to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupted officials or war-long drug dealers.
But today, with their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to a office in which the grenade was already thrown in 2009, or leaving them home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name the names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on hold with the Government or with cartels, a whole list of teenagers whose work on chaos is becoming dangerous in Mexico.
Violence does not give resumption, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that abound in the country: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enriko Pena Nieto assumed his post in December 2012; 589 people, after attacks and threats, are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter are their publisher and inspiring co-founder, Javier Valdez Kardenas.
“The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Waldes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is very acute, even though his presence is universally - a large photograph of Waldes, showing the average finger, with the label “Justitude” hanging on the Fascination of the Riodosa Building; two reporters in 30 years; Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing t-shirts, showing his smile, face in his eyes or his firm panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although the office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to investigate journalism cases, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Defence of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of homicides per year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists' murderers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they'll write about violence in Sinaloa, although they're killed by grief, even though they're much more dangerous around now.
Without information about murderers, without justice from security talks at meetings, Ibarra says.
"Very foolish to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"When we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
The morning of May 15, Waldes left the Riodosa office in the capital of the state of Kuliakan.
Only a couple of blocks before his red Toyote Corollu was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the title of the newspaper, which means the Twelfth River.
The shooter left his car and broke her nearby.
Waldessa was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Hearings usually go quickly across Kuliakana.
But about Valdez, almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vakuum.
Let us not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with two-story massoles of narcotics, which are more than many living people's homes.
Forget for a moment that the state of tranquillity is just when one of the cartels takes control of the naval state with important ports and pathways of the U.S. drug traffic.
Despite this and that Waldez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old cofounder and director of Riodosa, was crushed with guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks that two mistakes helped to kill him.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damascus Lopes, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, who fights with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have irritated sons; the people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were brought to the Kiosky.
The second error was that he did not force Waldes to leave the country for his own security after another newspaper, which was captured, wrote about the same story.
Waldes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Neroest and, in 2003, with five colleagues, he founded Riodosa, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinnaloa, “there was no room for journalism without affecting the subject of drugs,” said Bohorques.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales and advertising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but readers were attracted to reading about things that no one had ever dared to write.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received a prestigious Maria Murse Cabo Prize for reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Waldez won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate the Mexican drug trade wherever it may be.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ prize.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "the way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeyento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that you're both a journalist, or you're just a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Ryodose's staff miss Waldes, a joker who chattered like a loader in the port, a friend who was generous for arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to get alive.
They relied on his order.
He should've always wore his hat.
He had to go to Guayabo's El, bar across the office, and always sit there behind the same table.
Now they ask him, "Have he been destroyed by the love of one order?"
His death also caused them to doubt how best to do their work and survive.
"They don't like to know your wives, your children, their legal business, and their clandestine drugs airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorquez.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-assessment and self-sustainment.
We have to believe our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor "Riodose" Andres Villarel, is that "the obsession can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier."
Old rules, says he and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa - like the Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of profitable smuggling routes, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
In a room where Riodose was gathered for security training, it was suddenly prohibited to make cell phones: several days before it was known that spying programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadows of a tree of 104 degrees of heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They have been commissioned by the State Government to protect the Riodose office, which is located in the four-story building in the Bourgeois quarter of Kuliacan.
Some journalists asked about whether these police officers included 50 per cent of the order servants whom the Governor himself had said they should not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area under de facto control by drug trafficking gangs.
The next issue of Riodosa had three main themes.
This is the murder of the brother of the former champion on boxing, Julio Cezar Chavez.
They also had the exposing of government expenditures concentrated in the home city of the Governor.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliacan, blocked by the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it had happened, so caution had to be observed when the time had come to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time to drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of the policy of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated at all levels of government over almost the past century.
Several governors have recently been charged with aggravated corruption against PRI.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo, Guzman, slipped off the raids of the military.
A few months ago, readers would have sought Waldes' column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"Look, we'd already know what's going on," says 46-year-old William, for his artistic corpse called El Flacco.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are dissolved."
The Valdes Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and steekers protesting the killings of journalists, because the staff have become who they never thought they were: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went the following morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor ' s office devoted to another journalist.
El Salvador, Adame, disappeared in Michoacan State in the west of the country three days after Waldes was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the pavements and walls of the houses.
On that day, the Director of Bohorquez was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support in the requirement of justice in the Waldes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the following day after the murder of Waldes Ramirez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked not to give her any further publicity work, fearing that anger would harm her objectivity.
Waldes has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “circumcision” of organized crime, its associates in government and indifferent societies.
In his last book Narco-Journalistica, he wrote that the reporters are not killing just drug trafficker gangs; they do so by orders from politicians and security services in conspiracy with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee, Articulo 19, believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you down," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings scare people.
Everybody remembers the death of Mary's blogger Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, found a note allegedly written from the face of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboards and earphones lay next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent, Miroslava Bridge, was killed in March.
Others continue to hold as El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels with a editorial on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their home states or even a country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to look at the dangers on the streets.
And sometimes they're killed, as it's obviously happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, together with four women at Mexico City's apartment three months after the escape from Veracrous.
Those who remain and continue to work balance daily between risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he's afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico falls into hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the Riodosa publishers were sitting on the pavement next to the office and drinking beer when suddenly their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near Masatlan's resort city left behind, according to confirmed, 19 corpses.
The war continued to ignite, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the pavement, they put the news on the Riodosa website over their mobile phone.
The first page was to be reworked the next day.
There's another round in the neighborhood.
Bohorquez looked at whether the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't.
Sitting under the immense portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose average finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, Ryodose staff continued his case.
"How can you think about closing up," said Bohorquez, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the practicer asked me to send her to the street to report?"
The dinosaur used the camouflage to avoid the enemies.
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, even though he's terrifying.
The researchers reported that the first discovered remains of incredible creatures of the size of the rhino from a Canadian miner remained so well that the experts called it “Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs”.
It has been so well preserved that they have even been able to determine that the color of his skin was redish and brown, and to say that he had some kind of a dark past.
The report published in Modern Biology describes it as “the most well - preserved in Tireofor in the history of discoveries and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world”.
It is a newly discovered copy of a nodosaurus living in the middle of a milestone period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition was shocked by researchers who call it “very great”.
This grassy tyreophorus is the most well - preserved fossil of this species in the history of discoveries, according to the articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shannom Fank when he was working at the Millenium Mine of the Sancore Company near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He stumbled on something that seemed to be different from the natural rock, and he decided to look at it more carefully.
The mineral was sent to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work has been done to detect an animal inside the earth’s depth with a mass of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the outcome can be demonstrated.
“It's only a little bit fussing, and it's almost possible to believe that he's sleeping,” said the lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and most well-saved copies of dinosaurs — Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was vegetation, even though it had been covered by a pantry and was like a walking tank, likely to have been at great risk from fleshy dinosaurs.
This powerful pancreased dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from the predators and used a protective technique known as a protective colour, which is also used by many of the animals of our day.
This would allow him to quickly blend into the environment and avoid meeting the enemies, experts say, presuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This existence was widely publicized in the press in May at 110 million years of age, and is now exhibited in the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrelles.
Scientists have already studied the animal and have given him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the Museum Laborant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent over 7,000 hours after his scratch.
The amazing preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the image and form of the chechecheese and plastic plates on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a widely distributed method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the substance was darker than its bottom.
Although the shielding is widespread, the discovery has become surprising because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is considerably higher than the size of the live animals with protection.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by fleshy dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of the modern - day shielded animals — e.g. reindeer, zebras, or armor - bearers — are much smaller and more accessible mining, which shows that the nodosaur had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by the predators to a massive, coated, powerful pantry of dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Melov Period”, said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in dinosaur also indicates that its skin was to be red root.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the remaining contents of his food tract, to find out what he was eating during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken down into the sea where he had sunk and his back had his lung on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was as warm as he was now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread far farther deeper than now.
"This nodosaurus is indeed noticeable because it is fully covered with the rusty skin, while it has been fully preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost as it was at that time, in the early mill period.
There is no need for imagination to regenerate it, it is only a little bit of giggling, and you can almost believe that it is sleeping."
A small period is an age when giant theroposes, fleshy dinosaurs standing on two legs, wandered around the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaur of the river, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the tyreophor could be hunted by any of his terrifying ancestors.
These include acrocantosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) weighting six tons.
Scientists whose recent discoveries appear in the modern biology magazine believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in the fore.
The existence was found by Sean Fank when he was working in the mine of Millenium near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum officials, this is the world's most well-saved tyreophorus, together with the skin and the pancreas, and it was whole, from the face to the thigh bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (5 m) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic was the two twenty-tier skirts from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this grass - eating tyreophorus has been hard to walk on what is now Canada until the river that has flown into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his pancreas accurately to the smallest parts.
The fossil remains of this particular copy have been preserved so well that the leather remains still cover the pancreas along the skull of the dinosaur.
According to Michael Grészko in the National Geographic Journal article, the degree of safety is “real as winning a lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
Fossils of the skin are still covered by pancreas that swell the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it turned up.
I can count the scaffolds on his pilgrimage."
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to go to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then Odessa area in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without documenting his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival reports a Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on his channel on YouTube with his presentation.
Saakashvili addressed the commemoration of the Warsaw Revolution against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the Polish politician did not know, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician addressed the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, as well as Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service deprived Ukraine of its nationality, the Opal Politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents until unknown.
Previously, the former Governor of the Odessa Region, Michael Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for the acquisition of Ukrainian citizenship had been counterfeited.
The politician stressed that he didn't fill out any petitions.
The investigation of Wynesicher and Olkhovica has been extended until January
The preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renov group Evgenia Olhovik and the head of the Energy Cholding “T Plus” of Boris Weinzicher has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court deals with the extension of domestic arrest by the accused.
The representative of the SC reported at the meeting on the last decision to extend the duration of the preliminary investigation.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need to remove and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations on the territory of several RF entities,” said the investigator.
He added that suspects were regularly bribed by the leadership of the Coma.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olhovik, as well as the former ZAO leader, “Complex Energy Systems”, Mikhail Slobod, who presided over the Vimspel company by 5 September, handed bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of the Coma for the maximum benefit of the heat and electricity tariffs, as well as for the creation of an enabling business environment.
Weinzicher and Olhavik were detained, phased into Sictivcar and arrested for two months, and Sloboded escaped the investigation and was released to a federal search.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked.
Just one day after arrival in New York, Saint Luis, a tourist visit, sat on beds in an airbnb apartment, looking for a fairboard tape on the phone.
She tumbled on someone from high school.
It said, “The police just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noting that none of her tapes had penetrated this information, puzzled it, she closed the fairboard and opened the Twitter.
There were lots of passes in her tape with a user with a Nick @TheePharoah.
Reper from the Great St. Louis, in real time, reported on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, eighteen-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of Brown's lifeless body, spread out in the street where it would be four hours.
"This is savageness," thought Ferrell.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening she went back to the Tweets that people were going to Kenfield Drive.
There were photographs of the signal and the screaming people and the man who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who held the poster with the words: “The policeman from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched the direct broadcast, as the police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a scorching dog.
On another video, another policeman, she said, "I'm going to kill you... animals!"
"It's not a standard situation," - by her own memories, said Ferrell.
"It's not like killing that we're used to and can be called typical.
At that moment, I felt confused.
I was angry and crying."
She took a flight ticket and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years became the subject of a new documentary film entitled “Whose Streets? ” which will appear on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in flowers and crowns under color, they remembered a conversation that had led countless times before this morning, “for the experiences of black people and their situation”.
She recalls saying, “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
"I couldn't help taking her," said Ferrell later.
“What's happening today is the culmination of what has happened earlier.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised at it.
It must not only deal well with activism and organizations but also understand different levels of black people's experience and their situation and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I could provide her with an environment in which she would not personally face obvious racism, she was nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have given her a bad service if I would protect her from it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop was on South Florissant Road, on the roadway from a police station that was kind of a tent camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of the total innocence of officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined the local businessman who was preparing lunch packets.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Ferrel had a form of a new type of activism in his mind for a little while.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August,” she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missouri Sanitar Students, she was the President of the Association of National Minorities and was engaged in food justice and health inequality among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
It came by itself."
A few weeks later, Ferrel met Sabaa Folian, one of her co-sponsors.
Folian said that she and her principal operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrere were “simply seeking to document” events.
Ferrel came to the mind of the question, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that can be played on?"
This skepticism was nailed by many people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from his pain and persistence.
“We heard that the voices of people who were born and grew up in Ferguson were not focused, and we wanted to do so differently, ” explained the recent Foljan interview.
Foljan had already joined with her co-sponsor Damon Davis, a local artist known for its activism on the death penalty.
His participation sparked sympathy for the Ferrell project and for the six other local residents with whom the “Whose Streets?” project team had been liaising over the years following the assassination of Brown.
“In this documentary film, no one speaks for us or with us, it's what we're talking about," said Davis.
“It was the most important thing for me to see these people, because this is the way I will be represented.”
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience, it was to show that the movement was “not about the rescue leader, but about how the community was united”, as Folian said, it was the most open one of the participants in the film.
As a result, the “whose streets?” shows unexpectedly the personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, for example, how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked, ” said Ferrel, laughing about the first time she saw the product.
“But I knew that if you were doing such a job and humanizing black people, there should be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrel's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- those who created #BlackLivesMatter's tag in social networks after the murder of a black-adolescent Travon Martin in 2012 -- are treated as homosexuals.
"Black homosexual women in positions of leadership support all of this movement," says Ferrel. "And everything is because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Foljan agreed with this assertion, noting that “the movement is indeed supported by black women and many homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrel was not elected the central character of the film because of its distinctive characteristics.
"She was the man who sparked this energy," she said.
“ On the other hand, it's not the coincidence that it was first because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
In the meantime, there have been no cameras in Ferguson, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel's gonna be two and a half years on the test term for overturning the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that the home calls simply “Bardak”.
She's still holding up the thing she learned when she came out on Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for the U.S. player bite
El Salvador's Footballists, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, have received long disqualifications for unsubstantiated conduct.
During the fourth-funded round of the Golden Cup of North and Central America Confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAAF) Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was Henry Romero's defender.
El Salvadorans bit Josie Altidor's attacker, after which he snapped him for his chest.
Then semi-defense Seren, in the case of an angle in his sanction, bited U.S. defendant Omar González.
As a result, Romero was disqualified by three matches and Seren by six.
The meeting itself ended with the American win at 2:0, Goal.com.
Similarity: An artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
At the center of the Hall in Galera Friedman in New York, the faces of people hanging from the ceiling on the wire, white, black and brown, all of which are uncomfortable.
These 30 portraits were created by Heather Diwiy-Harborg, an artist from the cheeks and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent circumcisions from Fort Levenwart prison where a former intelligence analyst serves 35 years for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition on August 2 is called "According Similarity."
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewi-Harborg, whose arts unite technology, information and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident whom Barak Obama softened the sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing through the DNA computer software derived from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people who could have had such a genome, Dwy-Harborg created a deep, though difficult, manifest not only on the plasticity of DNA data -- different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interpretations -- but also on the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name of Bradley Edward, but since the teenage age, publicly said that she was a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spying Act, computer fraud and stealing.
Her photos were not available in prison, so only one photograph was known to her: a grainy black and white selphie, where Manning was in a Platinian shade of wigs, clearly feeling awkward, sitting behind the car, and associating her with that photograph.
In 2015, Dewi-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project on the Visions of Aliens.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of court evidence of the type of orange and chewing rubber, extracting from this DNA debris and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dwihi Hagborg on a preliminary show of a new press exhibit.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became friends on correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of Comic books “Suffered Images” illustrated by Shaili Kango, which illustrated how the president would in the future soften the punishment of Chelsea and could visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the release of the book to the light was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump declares war to people who reveal secret information in the Government, and discovers new ways to incite the strife he wants to soften in Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked to coincide with this all the time, she said, "It's nothing happened."
In a statement by an artist written on the gallery wall, a huge signature by Manning below (with a heart in place of a point on “i” in her name) calls for the end of “automatic division on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, the long caterpillars of the pencil C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as scientifically articulated), Dewi-Harborg was hoping to show us how we are all incredibly similar, in any case in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dwihi Harborg; her 2007 videowork "Lad Remembrance" is also displayed here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the aforementioned novel in comic books.
It has Manning in King Cong's style over the U.S. Correction barrels building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written.
"This is why don't you shut up."
"It's a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says a artist who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally -- like it was foreseen in comic books -- but when she comes, she'll be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulators, assembled, like crowds of protesters.
It is also deliberately done, as all at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning growth), where the pencil was painted by genetic gaplo groups.
"Before I'd put them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," Dewi-Harborg says about portraits.
"I wanted them to look like a mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like a movement that stood for her release."
A professor of the North-West University and a staff member at the University of Oxford searches the police for murder charges
According to the police, there is a national raid at a professor of North-West University and a staff member at the University of Oxford who are searched as suspects because a man was found dead in a luxury in Chicago.
According to the Cook District Court, on Monday, warrants for premeditated murder were issued without the right to release under the bail of the 40-year-old Windham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren for their alleged involvement in Trenton's death, James Cornel-Duranlo.
According to the documents, Kornell-Duranlo died after being subjected to multiple wounds.
In a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, and they arrived at the Grand Plaza complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornelle-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and the detectives are now investigating death from knives wounds, considering her murder, while the police are intensely searching for two suspects.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latem was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering the North-West University.
“This criminal case is currently being investigated by the Commissioners and the North-West University is cooperating with the investigation,” said Kabbaj.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
The representative of the University and Samerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We communicated with the British police and are willing to provide any necessary assistance to the United States investigative authorities”.
The statement also stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The Chief of Police Liaison of Chicago Anthony Gulelmi said that he was very encouraging the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have an assumption of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensified,” said Gullelmi.
According to Gullelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gullelmi, the police called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in number 108.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Gullelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July itself.
According to him, data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim have been connected,” said Google.
The Grand Plaza leadership issued a request to the lodgers, which reported: “The police are currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic accident”.
Russian vice-premier Mutoko: “We will meet the requirements of the VADA road map as soon as possible”
Russian Vice-Primeur Vitaly Mutoko said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conditions for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented shortly.
“The specific stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, RUSAD has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (Union Anti-Doping Agency).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly”, said Mutoko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the reconstitutement of the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of that organization.
According to Mutzot, it does not contain anything that could be difficult for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the claims included in the list implies that the Russian Indians must publicly recognize the results of the investigation by VADA of the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that the doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
Referring to this question, Mutko said, "We're investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no government program, and we won't admit what we didn't have."
He repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnova, Head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition “Rsport” Smirnov, he acknowledged the problems that had occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but he added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contained certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one's going to accept this report unconditionally," he added Smyrnov.
WADA has prevented RUSADA from carrying out doping controls in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to rebuild its work.
The 79th tower in Dubai is shattered.
The big fire that took place in one of the highest living buildings in the world, the tower of the Torch, is shaken, passes the Reuters.
It is noted that firemen have been able to deal with all fires by 4,00 local time (3,00 ms).
The local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
During the fire, the streets were closed to the sky scrap.
The reasons for this are not yet known.
Previously, it was reported that the 79-store tower of the Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world, was burned in Dubai.
All the inhabitants were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable bouzov's stroke of fans: trousers that don't cover the cowards
Olga Bouzov, a scandalal leader of the "Dom-2" show, struck the spectators of the Europa Plus Live festival with rabbit dances.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, a new duet singer with Nasty Kudri performed the song "We're going to be hot."
Both girls went out on the stage in provocative "birds" sewed in such a way that the lower laundry of singers appeared to be seen.
Buzova and Kudry were labeled on the pants.
Previously, it was reported that changes in the appearance of Bouzov had commented on a specialist in a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg recognized the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, by the Radio 4 news service, with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for deteriorating relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview by CNN NATO genes, he also criticized Russia for the situation with Krym and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that the dialogue with Russia was still possible and that the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Previously on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a dangerous low level, and accused the American Congress.
The Metro of Yekaterinburg introduces a new way of paying
In October, travel at the Ekaterinburg Metropolitan Metro would be available to pay for a bank card, stated by Paul Vedernikov in an interview with the Public Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 world soccer championship the same system for travel in subway as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want other people, mundial guests, to take advantage of the metropolitan by using their bank cards without taking jots or standing in line," he said.
Playtaps that will help your company not become another Uber
Amy Erett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, incorrect.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Erett, headed by 75 Madison Reed in San Francisco, an e-trafficking company.
She therefore appealed to others for help.
There is now a new type of staff startups that help companies to find out how their staff members feel.
By designing and licensing the software assigned to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to escape, to contact certain teams and demographic groups, to offer anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and, in some cases, to allow the informers to pass off top managers and directly address the Directive.
“Now we have instruments such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and President Glint of Redwood City, whose analytical programmes are used by companies to measure staff involvement.
Erett explained that she had gained a better understanding of what she thought and felt by her staff in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to espress-questions and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a warm map of the company and shows in an illustrative form, which has more complaints and whose approval managers have a low level, allowing them to understand why.
Companies are slightly aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, who was involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a blog post describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed displeasures were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The Internet portal, “Let's talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry by 2020, could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The Convercent Startap from Denver, Colorado, assisting companies in preventing and detecting bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the fall of Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual staff surveys, to collect confidential responses in real time and to review the heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that enable staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight into the Directive.
“The public opinion court overtook the power of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company is ill-treated or ineffectual, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face the costly consequences of battoos by clients, the outflow of staff and the judicial proceedings, reported to Quinlan.
“Ruby Tuesday”, a network of restaurants with over 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, used Convercent for more than a year to make sure that staff were aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's office.
Earlier, if a staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or a head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that she would be seriously treated.
Often this was a frightening and awkward experience, reported by James Vitrano, the director of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to monitor complaints from staff members.
Now, when the company is using the Convercent service, the problems previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, charity and unjust pay — can be found and handled quickly.
“I can draw closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation,” said Vitrano, who led the Risk Management Group of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from trials with the staff”.
According to Quinland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and engagements of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed as a result of ethical infringements as a result of Dela Enron.
But only when “social networks were spread,” companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty laundry from spreading viruses on the network.
“Before the use of technologies to control ethics, people have used hope as a strategy,” he said.
And Glint, and Convercent offer their software as a service, levying regular fees from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to receive the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received funding of $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from “Bessemer Venture Partners” in November, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising in view of the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that today ' s employees expect more of their jobs than they did before.
In hard-competitive markets such as the Sylicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the minimum necessary.
They want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they're spending their time with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, they feel they're listening to them, and that the work they do brings results, they're more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQuin, Vice-President for Global Benefits and Enjoyment of staff in Linkedin, where they are used and “Convercent” and Glint.
Investors get revenues when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses go well when staff are loyal and involved.
If the third party ' s analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and engagement of staff members, it is not surprising that they find support.
Cultural experts in the workplace argue that it is important to have data on staff participation.
But the data are useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback, it may give the impression that there will be a change.
And if change does not come fast enough or not at all, disappointment can develop, and staff may lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, president of the management consulting company Kotter International, who had to see companies commit an error by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the officers will wonder, ‘ Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Erett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff interviews, is in a position to take action on the same day as anyone reports the problem with Glint.
And after collecting feedback from staff who were dissatisfied with decision-making speeds and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning new knowledge of its staff and hopes that, in the long term, this knowledge will help it to keep staff more efficiently in the industry known for the high turnover of staff.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt is discovered at the Red Ormée
In Barnaul, fundamental measures have been taken to address the causes of the asphalt failures in the Red-Armaj.
The place where the holes had doubled on the recently embedded carriageway (the crossing of the Younger Street) was decided to “open”.
Remember, the destruction of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the land in the area of the homeless network.
According to the Vice-President of the Urban Road, Maintenance, Transport and Communications Committee, Ivan Garmat will conduct a detailed survey for the detailed survey and removal of the preconditions for the damage.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is envisaged that it will be necessary to rebuild and concrete the melting of homeless communications.
This is reported on the official site of the province of the capital.
Commander Brunes has to do longer because the National Students ' Sports Association cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching at 11 p.m.; a crowd of soccerists from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to talk on one side of the new training fields of the team at the Kampus.
Some of them pulled up their t-shirts, tearing their backs, brilliant sweat after the tense first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
The flying players will go back to their hostels after three hours of training to prepare for final examinations and return to Basserman's football center the next morning to meet at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, Bruinz Jim Mora, a coach of the team, said, “The next three days these guys are waiting for meat cuts.”
The fact that the National Student Sport Association canceled the exercise twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload for the players, actually extended their work day — at least until the end of the examinations on Friday.
So the beginning of the first three trainings of the California University team in Los Angeles was appointed at 7:15 p.m. to fit them into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two training sessions per day has increased the number of days with one training, and Bruinz is moving the beginning of the camp for almost a week compared to the previous year and conducts training during summer school for the first time in the six Mora seasons in Veciud.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training until 20 August before formal preparations for the first game in the season against team of Texas University A&M in September.
Mora said that it supported a change in the rules of the National Student Sport Association, despite the fact that another paragraph had emerged in the density of the players' schedule.
"For three or four days, we give them this huge burden, this is a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just got through it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it's really going to be great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; it is a challenging task, as its fields are in direct visibility with the adjacent parking parking parking and from the nearby Laskin Center, a dear hotel that had already been bombarded by footballs that had overcome the protective network behind the gate.
The Bruinz players should take the hotel from these weekends, but Mora assumes that a problem may arise when rooms are free during the season.
“We shall have security,” said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, assuming that someone can take the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have a video recording, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in the parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not going to worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All victims of the attack in St. Petersburg subway in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice Governor Anna Mitanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in stationars, transmitting the TB Centre.
Remember, the explosion in St. Petersburg was heated on 3 April this year.
The suicide bomber Akbarzon Jalilov was blown up.
As a result, 15 people were killed and the executioner himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abror Azimov, were arrested.
Recall that in the previous day, Rossbuvard recommended that the Metropolitan of Petersburg reconsider the road safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal searchers ' frameworks.
Facebook reinforces fact chequeing in the fight against fairy news
Facebook will be more likely to send the texts suspicious of mystification, independent experts, and to show their findings under the original posts, stated on Thursday the largest social network of the world that is trying to fight so-called fay news.
In a statement on its web site, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them to check and possibly show the results of the cheques under the base post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the most important ways of spreading so-called foe news, which many believed had an impact on the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters were misleaded by false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, prior to the September elections, they expressed support for a plan to fine social networks if they did not expeditiously remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook reported the testing of a new cheating algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Better than seeing what reports are contested by independent auditors, people want to have a broader context to make reasonable judgements about what they are reading and what they are sharing," wrote Sarah Sue in her tape manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "connected articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of fay news.
New novel comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the small castle of Skotney was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s was a shelter for Margaret Tetcher.
But for 700 years from his comfortable place in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he watched a turbulent story around, and now inspired Jamie Rods, the Yorkshirez, with a spear hair and a tendency to have historical documents, to a novel comic book.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at a man who died 300 years ago," he says with excitement.
"You feel it so personally when you hold that letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian Age and tells of the families who lived in Scotney; every story illustrated one of the young British artists, Ayzek Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Axli, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book of Rods, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Dead Man and Other Histories" -- a collection of papers from the British Library; this project suddenly touched him to the bottom.
"I could've pulled a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on an anchor," he says.
"It's a fingerprint."
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times fire was lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man who has such a passion for old papers, to receive support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and to live in a castle for four months (“In fact, I have a little bit of food there”) it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the Victorian Castle of Victoria, walking through the archives, and looking at the many treasures of property and old things, such as the head of guinea on walls or bottles that had been in the pit of centuries.
He walked through the park and at the ruins of the old castle, talked to the foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, in the night, he "walked his whiskey and sat down to write."
The story of Scotty Castle is not well studied because the National Fund has received full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the officers were only beginning to understand the archive he described as "that the Aristocratics had been dropped into the hills for centuries."
Days, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned, "You think land disputes are boring," says Rods, "but here's two families fighting for this beach.
There are times, boys!"
In some of the history of the castle collection, the hero is becoming the starting point for wider research in English history, for example, in the Robber, leaving the newly constructed castle to join the 1381 Crescent Revolution.
“There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called the Russian families of Kenta and Sassex,” says Rods.
"The Kristian uprising began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the castle story, for example, the Priest, which tells of the Jesuit priest whose Darrelov family has been hiding at her home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the Contrabandist, an 18th-century smuggler, Arthur Darrel, who is supposed to incur his own funerals, stoned the tomb (which was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug).
Darrela's favorite Rods family of all who lived in Skotney, "The Jentlmen seem to be a perfect guinea, they've been in debt forever, and they're spending money on things that they couldn't afford.
During various generations, the Darrela men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women -- I imagine them as a company of nice guys who can care for the heirs of big wealth."
Following the completion of the Rods Castle work, there are other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish slum, where he wrote a graphic novel about the Elamianmakes, a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Skotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like that, damn it, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen largest banks are selected by the "Rossia"
Conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARBs) is developing: following Sberbank, WTB, WB24, Alpha Bank, Gasprombank, Rossellhozbank, Binbank and FC “Option”, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, ARB organizations will account for at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not just a exit -- all banks that have declared a break from the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions -- the Association of Regional Banks, Russia, headed by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, recognized, by the end of the last session, and the most effective leader of the Duma Committee and the deputy on the number of drafted bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was initiated during the discussion of the Council of the Federation, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, including new bank classifications depending on the size of statutory capital.
At that time, Haregin Tosunian, President of the ARB, stated that, in the view of the association, the Bill was adopted in the interest of the largest banks, thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their clients.
Other claims included criticism against Centralobank, which, according to Tosunyana, did not always justify the revocation of licences from some banks, which was true to the objection by the representative of the CBC: many of the directors of the banks, in particular the External Prombanka, had been included in the governing bodies of the ARBs.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive views in a very sensitive relationship with the principal banking regulator and became a visible occasion for the fifteen largest banks, in dissent with the ARB policy, to start preparing for the association “Russia”, noting that “the efficiency of the ARB work would be low and that there was no constructive dialogue within the banking community.”
It'll be better for the investors.
What's the end of the case?
Let us answer the main question that arises in the least or nearby banking conflict: the investors will not be at risk, but the banking system will be more secure.
Leads the “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, known for its sensitivity in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all CB leadership is present in the annual activities of the association, and all relevant legislative initiatives of the regulators are carried out through expert assessments of the “regions”.
In the staffing-organization plan, there are also obviously no special shocks.
Surely, the ARB is in a difficult financial and management situation after such powerful and influential participants are deprived of their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - a banking community-friendly organization - there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the field of monetary treatment as a whole.
It cannot be said that, in an association of the Russian Federation with the protracted arms, they are ready to accept, on any condition of the new members, according to the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksakov (“may too much to want”), who, on 21 July at a press briefing in the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that “the next day, the representatives of the banks departing from the ARB had asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the capacity of our association “Rossia”.
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
A negotiating process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, the agenda for the extraordinary assembly of an association is being prepared in Sochi in mid-September through an international banking forum.
That's where we can figure out.
Also, Anatolia Aksakov, stressing that “the chair is not holding”, called the possible new leader of the renewed Association, Georgia Luntovski, who leaves the post of Vice-Chairperson of Centralobank in September with a high description of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolia Aksakov, who is now resting in Kruma, is planning to suspend leave and arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Association “Resession” to consider the agenda of the extraordinary assembly of the “Rossia”.
The entry of vehicles with petrol engine to major cities of Russia will not be limited
The Deputy Head of Mintrans Nicolas Asaoul stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline vehicles into major Russian cities will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our notion is that the ecological class needs to be gradually enhanced.
And there's the concept of going into zero emissions right away.
I don't think we're technically ready to do that.
The question is, since what year?
That's the same thing at the slogan level, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"By the age of 20, I don't know, maybe it's going to happen," quotes Prim's words to the Minister.
Earlier, the Vizvetia newspaper reported that by 17 August, the Vice-Primeur of Arcacia Dworković had been commissioned to examine the proposals for options for electric transport holders submitted to the Government by the PAO Director, Sergei Kogogini.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of cars from the AVS in major cities and in the resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for obtaining grindcards.
According to the media, President Donald Tramp stated that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the Grencartes rules.
The plan provides for the reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, the stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and the restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase the wages and save the taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so in the event of a change in how the U.S. grants Grencats to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of making statements will give advantage to candidates who own English, have financial resources that enable them to maintain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” said the Trump, according to the American media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
Once we think about 2017 as the year could not be worse, a new report on technological successes in sex robot production came out.
Uh-huh.
The sex robots are at the centre of the attention.
The Worker ' s Fund (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkie, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffild and the cofounder of FRR, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users can choose the color of the robot eyes, the form of the horns and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers, and soon we'll see them much more," said Sharkie at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex chicks have evolved from their industrious assemblies to robots with silicon skins, warm to patches, and almost human relics that govern artificial intelligence.
Users can also "construct" their robots by their own taste, selecting everything from the color of the eye and the shape of the robot's pineapples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "person" compared to that that Stepford Wife would be very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex goats have become robots with silicon skins.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to adjust the quality that they find attractive -- e.g. shyness.
There are other sex robots of Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which are already programmed to be an individual -- for example, "Holly Farra" makes a sense of shyness, and Dika Wendy has a "smart" character.
"The Roxxxy Gold has a character that's beautifully suited to yours," it's fascinating to report a True Companion site.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She's changed the mood during the day like the real man!
She may want to sleep or choke, or she can be "in the mood"!"
In the emergence of sex robots, there is a lot of concern -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but most concerned the subordinate image of a woman, associations with rape, which are causing the possession of the Cold Faroy.
On the "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrant only for men.
"If a woman has a vibrant, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex games.
Their emergence and the growing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, the departure from the ideal of gender equality to the desire for sex with subjection as an optimal supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of the consumer culture.
But what comes from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not foolish and aggressive until free markets allow them to do so.
It's not a coincidence -- that these complex sex robots have emerged just when women's rights around the world were threatened when there was a president in the White House who boasts about what comes to women.
The feariest thing in the Serialle of the Series is not graphic images, twisted bodies, and grinded eyes, that's how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The aim of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical image of real women (only with the proportions of porn), which technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear to be people on the stomach to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's the robots that do not look like real women.
They cannot break their partners or leave them.
They don't have their lives or their biography -- nothing that could point to independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful rabbis.
Or, as they say in 2017, they're servants.
L.A. Yujin (Puh) Gether, who has been in charge of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on 31 August.
Andrew Lebedev reported on this in an interview with the BBasket portal.
We tried to agree with Jather, but unfortunately he won't come on family grounds.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow our young players to develop," he said.
I recall that with the direct participation of Gether, the Ukrainian assembly took the sixth place in Eurobasket-2013 and first hit the World Championship on a basketball, where the “silto-Blue” was unable to overcome the group phase, and the U.S. producer recruited an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 picks and handed 5 gears.
Jetter has ceased to advocate for Ukraine since the resignation of the main coach of our national team of Americans, Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
The male Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Finland, Turkey, Romania and Israel.
The Ukrainian team will hold its group tournament on Earth.
The trustees of Eugenia Murzin will have five teams: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male assembly held two control teams, where Dutch and Belarusians were retreated.
A big fight of the Trump?
Looking like Mita Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the fact that the polarized political disputes of the United States electrorat have broken some families on a micro level was a common place.
Between the Day of Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers clogged with columns on how to deal with the horrible relatives who voted for the Trump.
I think we're all strained so that we're going to go.
They're talking less about Trump's ability to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, my left-wing poetry from Chicago, who's been on a long knife with the Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that the uniting in the fight against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
In the Trampe in the White House, all she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she had disputed over the policy for decades, were suddenly and strangely on one side.
This is no doubt good at dinner; but I cannot stop thinking that in a broader context it might be dangerous.
The trump inhaled the left flank, but the deformative effect of his rule could move us all to the right.
When we talk about the Trump and the “normalization”, we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will be disillusioned by his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing Republicans, who will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense in line with its standards.
I've caught myself so much in my old-fashioned madness today by Mitt Romney -- with a dog on the roof of the car and a 14 per cent income tax (but we knew at least what his tax declaration looks like) -- compared to the Trump both, and the other one seems to be a very small evil.
When the Trump goes away, the next republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park -- the largest carousel in the New York Park Department, and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are horrible and immense, the pictures of the glasswalls on the central drum -- the rubber clowns and animals, who are terrified and terrified to look at their backs, are extremely ominous, and the sound of music is fascinating.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointing: species from the sky scraps are getting old, building silhouettes are too fast to cause a trembling, and the reality of the city fails to be a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried the day I found out that Suiss-cottage is actually not a Swiss shale (the thematic pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not accountable) but a big round crossing in North London.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of eleven, and two women in 40 can have a great time.
If I could make a carousel valuation, I'd put a five-point, but fortunately, no one asked me to do that.
And this week at the umbrella, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" shops from one to five stars.
In the caffeine corner of my street, it's still the same plus 15 percent estimation of teas for a stake.
As a result, not only has neutral interaction slowed down, but it also has to take personal interest in a situation that does not imply it.
The poor salesman in the university smiled gently while I was tired of evaluating my experience of handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of the pain in the chest.
Pistorius leaves prison because of a visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on wrists, which the prison administration claimed he received as a result of his fall in the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of deliberate murder following an appeal by the Prosecutor ' s Office against an initial conviction for unintentional murder.
He killed Stéencamp early in the morning of St. Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his friend for the night gate hiding in his bathroom.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office stated its intention to protest this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which she said was too soft.
The Attorney-General stated that he would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be reviewed this year.
Pretorius may be 15 years old if the Public Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
NTW journalist suspected of being beaten has selected a subscription on non-departure
Citizen law enforcement officers elected a non-release subscription for a man who attacked a NTW journalist Nikita Raspjaev during a direct episode from the Gorky Park on 2 August.
This is reported by the TACS with reference to an official representative of the IMD RF Irena Wolf.
“In the investigation of a criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code, the 32-year-old man who hit the person of a correspondent of a telecanol in the Central Cultural Park and the rest of the name of the Horky, the suspect has been selected as a subscription on non-departure and proper conduct”, Volk clarified.
The representative of the Ministry added that an administrative protocol for police disobedience had been drawn up in respect of the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a direct episode on the day of VDW, an inevitable man approached the correspondent and hit the face.
As it later turned out, the bulligan has nothing to do with VAT.
According to the Ozrozjaev himself, the occupants, on the other hand, tried to detain the mosquito.
Two Bulgarian nationals were detained in Greece for illegal parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian nationals were detained in Greece for illegal cassation parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who had placed tents in an improvised place, including two Bulgarian citizens, was detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still being carried out.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the BTV Telecommunication that the Bulgarian citizens were subsequently released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the control of the free camping and have already imposed serious fines on all who are caught during a parking place not intended to do so.
The inspections will take place throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry accused the Vice-President of the United States of America of rhetoric during the Cold War.
Statements made during the European tour by U.S. Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by the Russian Ministry of Justice.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is growing up to the primitive ideologically ideological stamps of the cold war that are totally evaded of reality”, says a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
So in the MI De, they responded to the words of Pens about “Russian threat” and the violent crossing of the borders they had said in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated the destructiveness of the choice of “or with the West, or with Russia” and the uncertainty of the alleged non-alternative accession of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to detach Kosov from Serbia and thus created another hotel of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to stop the shelm of Russia and its foreign political line, which is consistently based on respect for partners and willingness to work together, on mutual consideration of interests,” says the Russian MIDA statement.
Feldsher suffered an accident with a “speed” in Pozmoskovier
The accident occurred in Stuppino, which resulted in an attack of an alien cart with the “Assistance” cart.
Today, about 08:10 msq occurred a clash of Mitsubishi's car with a speed ambulance in the city of Stupino of Moscow.
“As a result of the collision, the speed machine turned over”, said the TACS in the MAG press service in Moscow.
There are law enforcement officers at the site, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, the woman dumped her newborn son at the construction site, confining a celephane package.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident was informed to the Police Division that he had found a package with a baby in an unscheduled private house.
“On the scene of the accident, law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly delivered the child to the health facility”, reported in the Odessa Head of the National Police.
The medical authorities have determined that the boy was born a few hours before his detection, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
The birth of 36-year-old local residents is identified in priority operational and investigation activities.
It has also been found that a woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family had not previously been counted and had not been recorded in the law enforcement field.
Currently, the police have established the circumstances and reasons that have forced the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is under the supervision of the doctors.
In Nicolaus, a 21-year-old woman reportedly thrown her undernourished child into garbage.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, but 55 isn't 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian estrada, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebrity, the singer communicated with the observant.
I remember your colonel.
Gloria Gainor sings for the nominee, a powerful salute over Moscow River.
You must have pretended that you wanted to spend your next five years.
Did the plans come true?
If you're talking about a profession, it's been a good time.
I've been working a lot, three times traveling with hastrols all over the country, giving 120 to 130 concerts a year.
I made two nice albums.
Of course, now I'm not the one that, let's say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks don't deceive.
Sing as I sang at 30, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" on the one-named song that is written together with Timaty.
She's not quite ready, so we haven't taught her anywhere yet.
Let's do it later when we're going to have a video on it.
And the album will be presented in November for a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow, Crocus City Hall.
The great American drummer Chris Coleman puts his hand on your new plate.
Do you think you wanted him into your garstral composition to get him into?
I think Coleman is one of the most famous drummers in the world today.
He was coming to my studio, recording his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (known drummer participating in different projects. "Evenue") offered.
But for lengthy work in Russia, they were gently raising excessive conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought I'd find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found the great drummer Max Malashev.
It is better to feed your own.
Sometimes I want to get some of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is high at the international level.
Western music magazines and various hytar festivals invite him to attend.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said, "the new generation of guitarists has come with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I've been telling you that I'm in there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not stupider than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been facing the challenges that American musicians have always done.
They sought the highest level of quality.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has given me ten years' notice on my entry.
But I'm going to give visas documents every year to the British Embassy to allow me to go there again and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe belongs to me favourably.
And in August you have a concert in Monaco, not ordered, but private, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
Now we've been invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert have been distributed.
The Randev Laima Wykule, which will start on July 20 in Jurma, will you?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyme is a great singer and a beautiful woman who can offer herself and a beautiful fibre, and even a whisper.
After the games and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Highsky's creativity once.
Two albums with his songs you already have in discography.
When is the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to write about 80 to 90 songs of Highsky about the same pitch as he did.
Only the voice and the guitar.
No other handwriting.
I'll be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to engage in the album and Alexander Jacoblević Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what's going on.
You and Boris Grebencherov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you'll write down the album of his stuff then?
Boris Borisović is a great man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked him, Can I sing a song or something?
He said, "Grigory, I write songs to make them do."
Please try, sing.
It's probably interesting to record that album.
As long as I don't have that kind of task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisović doesn't mind, I'll probably do that.
If you don't focus fully on the business of your producer center.
I suppose until you've realized his potential, have you signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're the self-sufficient, the people that have taken place.
You mean Sergei Lazarus?
Sergei is a brilliant singer, I invited him in.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Panayots, whom I've been leading in the Gold.
We made a deal and work with him.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a pity if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to pick him up a repertoire, I'm taking his clips off.
I hope it's a good outcome.
I'm also trying to move other artists in my center: buying them songs, weeping poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the radio and television rotations.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a written album on the way out, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return the money they invested in them.
Although I'll be happy if one of them has a commercial success and pays me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, you don't want to overlapping oxygen.
Let everyone work, break, prove how I used to prove.
If tomorrow you're invited to make a tour in Ukraine and guarantee it to enter the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mainly closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, I believe, flying to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say they have to fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll run.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this has been the case with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people, and we must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And I used to do 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine a year.
We met nowhere.
A very thankful audience.
And with a few Ukrainian artists, Ani Laurak, Light Lobodai, Artem Loic...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and heartfeltly regret that they are now unable to make their talents fully available to a wide Russian audience.
Music needs to be able to combine and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely for the moment...
Andrea Olopkova was thrown out of the cosmodrom
As U.S. became known, the Technical Director of the Space of East Andrea Olopkov began his work at the State Space and Production Centre (HCCN) on the name of Khruniczewa.
Earlier, he had done de facto construction of East space, but because of disagreement with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure Management (CENCI) had been transferred to a facility in Moscow Phila where the coordination of production was undertaken.
Mr. Olopkov will have no change: the technical director's post is likely to be abolished and the function is dissolved by CENKI units.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of CENCI for Technology Development, Andrey Ollockkov, moved to work at Hrunicev's HNPC, U.S., told the top managers of several space industries, as well as the staff member of the Government.
"He's been working for a new post for a few weeks," said the U.S. interlocutors in the industry.
CENCI ' s operational comment on Thursday failed, and Mr. Oilkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the U.S. information was officially confirmed in the HCCN.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, said to the enterprise. - Andrey Bootkov, his task to provide a minimum of launch for the first launch on the East launch was fully accomplished.
Mr. Olopkov moved to work at CENCI in 2013, with a shoulder service in space forces, in particular in Baikonura, and in Plesetsk, the “very” cosmodome was the first deputy commander in the rank of the Colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Olopkov became a criminal case.
The consequence accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional commercials were received from the State order, but did not comply with the commitments made to clean off separate parts of the launching missiles in the Arcangel region and the Republic of Coma.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development in CENCI were extended to various projects, but most of them were the construction of space in the Far East.
The then president of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Restepenko, in an interview, said directly that the situation in the East was “critical already in October 2013”.
The case was that a strategic error had been made in the planning process: the completion of the construction and the first start of the “Soise-2.1” missile was planned for the same time, the end of 2015.
In order to implement the launch until the end of the year, the construction had been completed six months earlier and had been postponed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it had to be cunning: CENCI experts had begun to build parallel technology equipment in under-developed facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrey Oilkov.
Notwithstanding the risks that existed and the transfers that occurred (on December 2015, “Soise”, only took off on 28 April 2016), this idea was justified, says the U.S. source on the cosmodome, “Would we still not have a single start from the East but would have been doing the construction work”.
The vice-premier Dmitry Rogozin, the cosmodroma manager, jested to call Andrea Olopkova his “space Susan,” but he almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Boyskov, he remembered: for example, in the U.S. interview, he proposed depriving the Federal Special Construction Agency (Specister) of the only East and direct work with subcontractors, "Why should we put all eggs into a single Constituency basket?"
That idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the general contractor to complete construction and maintenance work on the launch and technical complex by launch launch launch launches in the fourth quarter.
According to the UN, Mr. Olopkov's transition to a new place of work was a controversy with the management of CENCY on how to complete the construction and space complexes, as well as how to work with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for all," says one of the top managers involved in the Orient.
A government staff member, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best professionals, finding him an equivalent replacement would be difficult”.
According to the “U” data, this would not be necessary: the post of technical director of space would be abolished and its functions would be distributed to CENCI units.
A two-school curriculum will be launched in musical schools
In the future, pupils at the musical schools will be able to receive two specialists at the same time.
According to the Minister of Science and Education of the Minosculture of St. Pigeonenko, it is possible to re-evaluate the repeated disciplines of students, and the question of re-paying the rest of the studies in the second speciality to be resolved through special grants is transmitted by the RIA News.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we are working with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow two specialities to be learned, but at the same time will not be inconsistent with existing legislation in the field of education,” said Blueenko.
On Friday, Vladimir Putin, with the tutors of the Syríus child centre, a student, Maria Andreev, reported that she had to pay recurrent items in the second speciality at the MCS at the Moscow Conservatory.
She told me that she was studying violin and piano class and had the awards of both competitions.
The Head of State recognized the matter as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russians are detained on the wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Cyril N., who, on the wall, clipped on the roof of the high building, reported the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, using two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office buildings complex and took himself into one of his towers.
He did not use any special equipment, insurance, and rope.
We got a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security staff dropped him on helicopter land.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out whether the young man is legally located in the country.
In the meantime, videos with a young person at a height have become popular in the Network.
Users called the young man Spider.
According to the media, such experiments are hobbies for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate ADC.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies suggest that diet rich in meat proteins and breastfeeds can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammable intestine disease.
This incurable disease, which suffers from about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leads to creeks and abdomen, chronic or bloody rubber, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
In order to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and breastfeeding, but researchers at Washington University found that the main amino acid protein triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestine.
Dr. Marco Colonna, a leading researcher, explained that immune cells in the intestines are watching to prevent harmful microbes from entering the body.
Cells capable of starting the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium is too severely inflammatory, it can lead to inflammatory incense.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in a basket has increased tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria needs a triptofan -- one of the protein building elements -- to start the emergence of these cells.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a link between one species of bacteria, Lactobaciillus reuteri, which is part of the normal microbiom of the intestine, and the development of the cell population that increases tolerance.
The more the triptophane was kept in the feeding of mice, the more the immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same work would be done with people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less incinerated environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying the variety of more tolerances of immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but contained separately did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mice bacteria, viruses, and mushrooms that normally live in a pulmonary kitty tract.
The DNA of the basket cells was sevenated, and six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells but missing from mice without them.
The mice, raised in a sterile environment, with no good microbiome and not developing this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and their immune cells came into existence.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then carried small portions of liquid, without bacteria, into the underdeveloped immune cells from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptophane, known as indol-3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of troptophane in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophane was doubled, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same increased tolerance of the cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our stomach-cheating tract.
Whether by-products of triptophan from L. reuteri are conducive to the development of cells in people like mice, but people with inflammatory intestine diseases have detected defects in the triptofan genes.
She says, "Perhaps the development of these cells should be strengthened, because these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
The high levels of triptophane, if L. reuteri is available, may potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
According to José Mourinue, Manchester U.N.E. has hired “genies” in the face of Nemani Matić
Manchester Unated hired the “genies” in the face of Nemani Matic, considers José Mourenium after a semi-defense debuted in a match against the Sappdoria tonight on Wednesday.
The player, acquired for 40 million pounds at Chelsea, began with a 2-1 winning in Dublin at the last pre-sessional game called U.N.A., before the Supercube W.E. v. Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a semi-defensor, while players like Pogba and Andreas Perira burst forward when they wanted to.
However, since Matich did not participate in the Chelsea Pre-session Tour on Asia, he was seriously lacking preparations for the game, and he endured only 45 minutes, which, according to Morinue, required further development before the beginning of the Prime League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks soccer,” said Mourinue.
“We will help him prepare sooner than it is late.”
Just like Matich, his new players Victor Lindelef and Romelu Lucak began playing at Aviv's stadium when Mourenia began forming its main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Indonesian newspaper reported this week that Moriny wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for the three out of four,” he added.
"I'll be more happy if they get me four out of four, but they've done a great job for me."
Former leaders of the social democrats of Lithuania encourage them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Lithuanian Democratic Social Party, the former Prime Ministers of Algirdas Boutkjavićus and Guedminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Simeon Speaker of the Social Democracies of Cheslovas Jurchnas, appealed to the unilateral parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported in the “Parliamentary newspaper”, tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and Greens - have led to a discussion in the Social Democratic Republic of the Party as to whether the ruling coalition should remain.
The three senior experienced associates approached the same parties with an open letter, which states, inter alia, that “the disappointment of the party's parties with the results of the elections is understandable, but the coalition with the “Crestiians” has created for us no matter how easy it is, but the conditions for the further realization of the objectives of social justice, which our initiative is envisaged in the Government's programme, and to maintain the political dominance of the left-wing centre over the right parties”.
In the view of former party leaders, the debate has so far “realized emotion-based expressions without specific arguments”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by unreasonable actions.
A disabled Anton Mamaev was fined.
Moshorud has reduced the punishment of the handicapped handicapped man, Anton Mamaev, from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Previously, the judgement of the Timiirazew Court had been released from the SIZO.
On the other hand, Mosgorud confirmed that the accused was a criminal, since he had organized a robbery and abduction of a motorologist at the former Skénaz fighter.
Moshord, by his decision, reduced the punishment of Anton Mamayev to 200,000 roubles.
“Mamaeus is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the composition of the crime, and therefore must be prosecuted,” explained the U.S. Spokesman for Mosgordo Uljan Solobova.
In this case, the Court took into account Mamaev ' s health status, the factual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the penalty could be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamaev Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would constitute grounds for changing the category of gravity of the case and for changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he remained disapproved of the Mosgorous Court decision.
I'm disappointed by a court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification and will continue to fight for justice.
His counsel, Andrey Orlov, did not dismiss the appeal before the Court of Cassation of Mosgorous Court and the Supreme Court.
"We'll use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA Newsty".
Remember, the 28-year-old Moscow of Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a criminal case in the autumn of last year.
Disability claims to have bought a motorler from acquaintances for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, Motoroler owners, including a former fighter of the Strassa, stated that the disabled and his assistant Vasili Serostanov had taken property from them, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timiiranev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Serostanova to three years of colony, while Anton Mamajeva was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment and serving sentences in a general regime colony (art. 162, para.
After the disabled person was placed in the SIDS, the Public Chamber, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timiirjaze Court.
The defence, in turn, appealed against the decision of the first instance in Moscow.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The 2017 General Russian People ' s Front ' s Fund of Action will focus on environmental issues, reported to “Investigators” a source in the United Nations and reaffirmed the head of the Alexay Anisimov Police.
He said that, as a result of the Frontiques Forum, it was planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental problems and to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interviewers at the FNF noted that the report of the head of State would contain “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to ODS, the outcome forum of the ONF will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its holding is not yet determined, as a rule, under the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at the key activities of the UNF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts in Rostowe-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan Woode.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward at these events, we will also develop systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and the interviewer with the ONF “Investigators”.
The Co-Chair of the Olga Timophoeva Central headquarters, chairing the Committee of the State of Environmental Affairs and Environmental Protection, reported that “Frenchers” would report to the head of State on the work of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The Concluding Environmental Forum and the Plan of Action of ONF are likely to be reconciled.
In a year, we expanded a powerful team of experts on environmental issues, saw gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we prepare for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “Frenchers” will report on the work on the priority projects of the ONF, as told by Olga Timothyva.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergey Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had already participated in the work of Mediaforum ONF, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go back to history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to make them work for years.
To avoid falling out of the agenda, Olga Timothywa added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Studies (EISI), Andrey Colladin, noted that in raising environmental concerns, the UNF operates within the presidential agenda.
Many things as experts have been offered in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President, "Evidence" Andrey Colladin.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give the regions additional impetus for development.
The expert added that, in the future, through the FIF, the regions would be able to break out not only their environmental problems but also the development of eco-tourism.
The relevance of environmental topics was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the bulk dump in Balachya (hereinafter closed) and the coal dust at the port of Nakhaka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal transfusions in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timothyva).
Ecology experts believe that the legal framework for addressing environmental problems in Russia has been established in general, the issue is further enforcement practices, as well as civil society positions.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is considered by Leonid Bocin, Head of the Fund for the Environment for All.
The HRT member, Head of the Greenpeace Russia NGO, Sergei Chickenkov, in a conversation with “Investigations”, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business was needed to successfully address environmental problems, some legislative efforts were scarce.
As soon as society and business realize that addressing environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, said Sergei Chickenkov.
The expert stressed that a trend should be reversed that a violation of environmental legislation was an economically beneficial solution for the business.
British inventor used a microchip to get into a house and a car by the gмах of his hand.
The British inventor was the first man in the country to have a microchip set up to open his home door, enter the office, and even make a car with a simple glimpse of his hand.
Steven Northam, a 30-year-old, has used a tiny chip between the big and the pointing fingers, and now through his BioTek company, offers this service to firms and private individuals who want to simplify their lives from the technology account.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthetic consultant from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the use is conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technology is like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compliant at 300 pounds per lock.
A married father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Requisite for the White House has cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine TIME, the White House decision last month to ward off a seafood helicopter on the South Lizard for an event dedicated to the American Industrial Production cost $24,000 to the taxpayers.
The Sikorsky VH-3D White Green, known as Marine One, when the President is present, became the central part of the event held in the White House on 17 July, where American construction programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and senior officials of the White House inspected technological products from all fifty states.
A helicopter in Connecticut was placed next to a boat from Man, a firewall from Visconsin and a loader from Mississippi.
According to the Records of the First Esscadrille of Sea infantry helicopters (HMX-1), the Helicopter Administration of the White House military ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the South Lawn on the occasion of an “uncommon” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you were aware, because this is an unusually extensive press event”, wrote commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to his chief, the first Deputy Aviation Chief of the Sea infantry Corps, on the e-mail of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lizard at approximately 7 p.m. on 17 July for a three-hour event and remain there before the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to reflight according to the time limit.
The first crew was accompanied by a helicopter during the event, and the guards of the unit remained close to the aircraft while they were on the ground.
The records received by TIME left unclear whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch law prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the activity was inconsistent with that decision.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it was not,” wrote the commander.
“It is like you have nowhere to go,” replied the Deputy Chief.
The event “Done in America” was declared a White House as an official event, and Hatcha's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the reform of the health sector that was then being drafted in the Senate and commended the efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking for them is the only one in the interest of photographic possibleness.
The trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove back at his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his share in Twitter with complaints about the use of his predecessor ' s presidential plane.
“The white house is delighted with the display of “Done in America”, which presented products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, Deputy Spokesman for the White House.
The crews of HMX-1 often carry out training flights around the Washington agglomeration and in the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy up to an inch.
When the Tramp was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the event “Done in America” was recorded to the crew in respect of the necessary training flights per month.
The units also flyed 11 additional hours on that day as part of “non-President support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not costed for any of the other exhibits represented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in a helicopter demonstration in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and determine the exact amount spent on the event is difficult.
But according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017 fiscal year, the reimbursement rate for the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit ' s records show that the airplane time was 30 minutes each side of its airfield based on the Kuantico Marine Infantry base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“Assessing the cost of taxpayers, based on an approximate rate of reimbursement, is totally incorrect,” said Walters.
“These exemplary rates include the composition, services and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, services and the costs indicated in the treaty.
At the time, former Speaker, White House Speaker, Speaker, spoke in defense of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea of showing things made in America this week,” said Spyser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like the majority of Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military technique, which has worked tirelessly for so many Americans.
It is, of course, appropriate to draw this attention.”
It was unclear whether Trump had been interacting with a helicopter, looking at the southern grasshopper during the event, but he had definitely been sitting in a driving spot in a fire car.
In the White House, Trump addressed the representatives of Sikorsky to the press on the subject of his own fleet of the products of the company.
"I know Sikorsky well," said the President. "I have three of them."
Moscow will provide grants for the rehabilitation offices of urban hospitals
The annual grants of Life Savings will be allocated to the intensive treatment of the capital clinic.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, visited the Urban Clinic Hospital of Judas.
During his examination of the clinic, he gave a thankful letter to the traumatic doctor, orthopaedo Victor Protzko, led by the most complex operation to reconstruct the teenage foot.
Sergei Sobian also described the decision to allocate annual responses and intensive therapy to urban grenade clinics.

Currently, medical offices are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive and stationary, there are day-to-day offices.

The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term stations (SPC).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
Best medical equipment is used in surgery to reduce significantly the time limit for the rehabilitation of patients.
After operation, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year, 36,000 patients were provided with permanent medical assistance at the Judas clinical hospital.
Medical clinic staff performed 1,800 operations in various degrees of complexity.

Said Guzerieev, the son of the Russian businessman Mikhail Guzerieev, was the consortium master of the consortium.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.

Democracy in Afghanistan depended on the role of women in politics, stated in the United Nations.
The elections could be representative only when all members of society, including women, spoke on Wednesday to the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Hazom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are being voted for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Burity
The efforts of the Soviet and Post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buratia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the cost of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Government ' s Regulation on Changes in the Regulation on the Optical Energy and Power Market and the Consolidated Balance of Electronic Energy (Energy) Production and Pollution (Environment) within the Russian Federation' Single Energy System on Substances, established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Burity (17.07.2017).
As a result, the cost of electrical energy for burial producers is reduced by a quarter, making life easier for small, medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have been circumventing Moscow Cabinets in futile attempts to equate the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkuts region with a hazcade of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, which flows from Baikal, the main watershed Territory for which is Buratia.
Only this year's moves started.
In March, the tariffs for electric energy for the population were reduced from 4.24 rubb/kWh to 3.93 rubb/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of Buratia by the Federal Government ' s decision in the List of Territories of the Optical Market Price Zones, for which the features of the operation of the whole and retail markets have been preceded by industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the Irkutsk region pays for kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares to describe at least the near date of the new tariff movements towards the downfall for Buratia.

National trade union of unskilled, municipal and boiling workers (GMB) is concerned about investing in McVitie's in Glasgo
Trade union requires guarantees from the biscuit producer McVitie's in connection with his long-term obligation to produce in the Glasgo factory.
The GMB Scotland office reports that the future investment of the Torkos object was silent.
More than 500 people work in a factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years she has invested more than 5 million pounds in the site.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the facility, staff members and trade union representatives will “know first”.
In a letter to the leader of the company, the GMB Scottish office demanded McVitie's reactions to concern that funding would not be allowed for modernization of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the master of the business and investment plan on the future of Tolcross.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the Great Glasgo territory; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of Brexit, the growth of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline in production, East End Glasgo desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The leader of the Torkros facility just yesterday received a letter from the GMB Scottish office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with trade union staff and representatives”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with staff members and GMB representatives, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to the staff that, as all companies working in a competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions — and this concerns all our facilities and activities — to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Torkros site, especially in production lines and improved functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a productive facility, and in the event of any change in the work on the site, the staff and trade union representatives will learn first.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not provide guidance to Rosenefti and Gasproma
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of gas transfers to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (GNPC) should be joined by the Kreml and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give the Gusproma instructions as well as “Rosnefti”.
Thus, President Vladimir Putin of Russia responded to the request of Igor Secini to help resolve the contradictions.
The Head of State noted that the relationship between “Rosneft” and “Gazprom” should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Previously, Igor Secin, Head of Rosnifty, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, reported that the lack of agreement with the Gazprom on gas for HNCC jeopardizes the project ' s duration.
Sachin noted that the dialogue with the Gasprom on this issue was continuing.

Has Barcelona been warned of the transition of Neyamara three years ago?
The La League member may regret his interest in Marko Verratti.
Pari Saint-German will not stop pursuing Neyamara after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record of the three years ago?
The sanctification proposal was revived by a summer transfer window when the League 1 Club was ready to break the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark of the return of Pogba to Manchester United Nations during the last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition ends, Naymar will be the most expensive player in the world, as well as the world ' s most highly paid professional athlete, as SPW offers him a salary of more than 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona and the rage of the proposal were expressed and how Naimar broke the contract, despite the fact that a source close to the leadership of the Catalan Club insisted that the club had always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But has the soccer world been warned of this possibility three years ago by the President of the SPLM?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the hiring of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a rigorous warning to any club that would like to lure one of the best players of the SPLP.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going to oppose them, we're going to make the offers to their players," said Al-Helaife.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed its interest in the Marco Verratti semi-professionalist.
The SPL made it clear that the Italian player would not be released as a compendium under any conditions, and now it is likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of his proposal as the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neyamara.
