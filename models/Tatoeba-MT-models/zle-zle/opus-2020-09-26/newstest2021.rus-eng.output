Semilarski v. Public Prosecutor ' s Office: Cassation of the former Vice-Mer of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that a decision on it is likely to be made in early September.
The Courts of First Instances refused the Samilarsky claim, but in April his appeal was filed by the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019, as its authorization did not fall within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court order stated that the complaint contained a claim for reparation in criminal proceedings.
“Regulation of such matters must be done by the Procurator ' s Office and the departmental court”, previously explained to Correspondent ERR as the Spokesperson of the Tartu Courts Annet Kreittsmann.
She said that Walvo Semilarsky had appealed the judgement before the District Court, which had not changed the decision of the first instance on 5 February.
Now I'm going to say my word to the Lord.
According to Defender Semilarsky, jury lawyer Oliver Nees, his client for about two years was unfoundedly suspicious of bribery.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor's Office refute the unfair allegations and reparate them with moral harm.
The case of the prosecutor in the special cases of the Liuna District Procurator Margus Gross, which he made in October 2017, when Semilarsky, together with the other Vice-Mert Tartu Artem Sukorov, was detained at that time on suspicion of having committed several crimes.
“Remind us that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential bodies of local governments, were corrupt.
These public suspicions were accompanied by me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions were false, the Prosecutor's Office doesn't want to say anything about it,” commented Semilarski in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the Prosecutor ' s Office should act.
"The assertion of bribes and corruption proved to be false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its rulings on Russia as well as in Lithuania that, at the investigation stage, the representatives of the State should be careful in the choice of words that suspects would not be represented as criminals before the sentence was handed down.
The Prosecutor's Office also requires a presumption of innocence, which unfortunately has not been respected in this case against Walvo Semilarski,” said Nees.
“The public submission of Semilarsky as a serious offender and a bribe in the circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is inadmissible, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfairly towards the complainant,” added counsel.
According to rus.err.ee, the former vice-mair of Tartu Walvo Semilarski will not be held accountable for the charge of bribery - the criminal case against him against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is judged on charges of deliberately infringing anti-corruption legislation in specially large transactions.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in city law meetings in decision-making by companies operating in Tartu, whose owners or leaders were actively engaged in personal contact at an extra-employed time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarska had personal interests, and he had to withdraw from the decision-making process.
Previously, as wrote rus.err.ee, the Procurator ' s Office had suspicion of receiving a bribe and of infringing anti-corruption legislation in specially large transactions.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there was good evidence against both Vice-Merals.
The two officials then resigned.
The Suvorova case later reached a court that had fully justified the policy.
The trial in the Walvo Semilarsky case is still ongoing.

How the CB's decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Russian Bank is expecting to re-decrease the key rate.
It dropped by an additional 0.25 per cent point, to 4.25 per cent of the annual, a formal regular historical minimum.
As a result of the return of a short drop in the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated projections on the Russian economy, the controller looks at economic prospects more optimisticly than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy alleviation can soon stop.
“We continued to mitigate the monetary policy, primarily given that the risk of inflation declined from 4 per cent in 2021,” reported the head of the Russian Bank, Elvira Nabiullin.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiollina, will take over one and a half years.
It noted, however, that, following the lifting of the restrictions on the pandemic, the economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, the construction and production of consumer goods increased, and the annual decline in goods and production slowed down.
According to the specified TB projection, in 2020, the economy was reduced to 4.5.5 per cent (before expected 4-6 per cent), while the recovery of the economy in 2021 was 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, and 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Russian Bank revised the annual oil prices projection to $38 and 40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
The CB had previously expected $27 and $35 for the barrel.
Finally, the inflation bank projection for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent against the earlier expected 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The view of the Russian Bank on the economic situation becomes more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, considers economists for Russia and the CIS “Renaissance Capital” Sofia Donets and Andrea Melaszhenko.
Thus, the Russian Bank has consistently lowered the key rate more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 percent.
At the last meeting in June, the CB had reduced it to one percentage point immediately due to the low rate of inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate the volatile economy as a result of the pandemic and its related constraints.
The pre-deployment of the monetary policy remains (at the next meeting of 18 September and until the end of the year), but the limit is close, agrees the main analysis of Rosbanka Evgenius Koschelev.
The combination of inflationary risks also indicates the proximity of the gap in the mitigation of interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to the prevention of the epidemic and faster (as compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
The follow-up of the Bank of Russia will require more attention to inflation during the harvest season, as well as to the external volatility of the geopolitical conflict, says Koshel.
In any event, the reduction in the key rate will lead to further reductions in the rates for the most reliable borrowers and possibly on the mortgage, says Maxim Petronević, an economist of the analytical bank's opening.
The adjustment of rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, it would specify.
Needs rates may fall by 0.3 to 0.6 per cent for the second semi-annual, mortgage rates may be completed at 6.2 to 7 per cent, and the BCS Premier Anton Catovic is not excluded.
In his view, the average rates of contributions would also fall - they could drop to 4.2-4.5 per cent in the coming months (now barely above 4.5 per cent).

The authorities of the Pozmoskaya told us about the fate of closed landfills.
The area of solid waste continues to be closed in the Ground.
This year, the authorities are promised to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills existed in modern garbage systems.
But it's not possible for every polygon, but many of them have grown up with a dense vegetation.
After the polygon is closed, it rises to regeneration - the polygon's body is overwhelmed by soils, mounted degasing systems and dismantling infiltrates.
This prevents chemical processes inside the dump from igniting, bleeding, poisoning soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to be raised with a useless bunch of food in the midst of its abnormal building.
Why don't you do something useful about it?
For example, in Ruz, where the rehabilitation of Annino Polygon ended literally in the days, the authorities are considering making a bunch of mining slopes.
The area, which has been operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown to the extent that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land.
Therefore, the regeneration had to buy out neighboring sites that de facto had long been killed by garbage.
"Some time will pass, the polygon will sit down," and the fortress will come, and we'll think what we can do to make it a good start.
The head of the Russian district, Nicolas Parfenov, told the journalists.
Two polygons will be renewable energy sites
Torbeevo Policies in Ljuberts and Timohovo in Bogot City will become sites for renewable sources of energy from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, a gas-propelled power plant will be launched in Torbeeva, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hour electrical power and about 0.95 hygacalories of heat, which will provide for its own needs, thermal supply of administrative and production facilities.
Timohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and continue its work as a garbage processing complex.

Beautiful high-minaretes only adorned Aya-Sofia
Once again about Aya Sofia, the text of O.Vladimir Zelinski had to be protested.
First of all, there's a free entrance, hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's house is better for free entrance than paid.
Secondly, Muslims have earnestly conquered this land, as the Orthodox have conquered the Volgo-Okan intersection, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozno) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered the Americans.
Are we going to get everyone back?
Do you think there are no Gentiles who will need to return their cape where the Tenth Church is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims have made this building better and invested in it.
I mean, they're just like the plants and places that the Lenins have taken from the Bourgeans into their property, they're owned by the Lennites, Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from Kremlin to Angana, so they're all on the right of the progressors.
Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid nun, a stupid nun with beautiful minerals.
Fourthly, there are no "Islam" and "right-looking" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanges that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of a British MIDA Toynby, a believer who's embarrassed to think that way.
And to the believers there is a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
He who believes does not pray except wherever he is asked to leave, and he departs therein and prays therein.
But he is a believer, and he is not a defender.
We're squirrels, not stones.

The authors “remembered the sharpness of the subjects raised and did not want to insult anyone”, said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in a conversation with the publication “Subject”.
"I think it's a story about the power and general aspects of human life.
It's not connected to LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the father of a boy who was transformed into a woman's clothes.
He stressed that he was “dignant to work” and did not view it as propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightened by the reaction of some people to the serial line: for example, there was a case where "a man in his deep mouth shot a diversion site and said that it was not true."
"So a couple of cases were when we met the dissatisfied local people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims began to help us," he summarized.
