Republic Resistance Strategy for Obama ' s Re-election
The leaders of the Republican have justified their policy to combat falsification in the elections.
However, at the Brennan Centre, it is considered the latest myth, claiming that falsifications in the United States elections are more rare than deaths from the thunderstorm.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States have been counted by the Republican lawyers for ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that make the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon was new in the aftermath of the November 2010 elections, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, in just one 2011, 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 states have been adopted.
New electoral laws require the voter to issue identity cards with a photograph and evidence of American nationality.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early vote, abolish the right to vote on the day of voluntarily vote, and denounce the right to vote from citizens having jurisdiction.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. State obliged voters to issue identity cards with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities have hurried to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to make identity cards with a photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a medical insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have identity cards with a photograph issued by the State Government.
In addition, five million new voters have no such document in 2012.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of those who earn less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required identity card with a photograph.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for candidates from democrats are not allowed in several states to use identity cards with a photograph issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states permit members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for the Republicans, to use the certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no State required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, this requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are United States citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the vote of Latin American departees.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators initiated in 2011 laws that abolished voter registration on the vote day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a decline of 17 per cent in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of pre-term voters were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same was true for Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted prior to the vote.
Unlike the white, 76 per cent of the voters, there were only 46 per cent of the voters pre-term.
Of course, democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to enacting laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws have been politicized by democrat governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended in the intervention of the United States General Prosecutor.
This has limited partially the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring identity cards with a photograph.
However, the new rules that had entered into force certainly made it difficult to exercise the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Critics against democrats condemn the biased laws that had been enacted, with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Centre of Brennan shows that the States that enacted those laws represent 171 out of 270 votes required by the electoral panel to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to argue with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
It is only one thing that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Carbon cancer screening: is it tested or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces mistaken results, false negatives, and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical interventions.
Husbands, and so reluctant to dispanserize, are even more questionable.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked the views of the two specialists.
Research conducted in the United States has witnessed numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so it is difficult to interpret and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different rate of death in those patients who had been screening and those who did not.
The study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasy is 30 to 40 per cent higher for those who have not been screening.
So I would recommend a test starting from 50 years, or from 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of Afro-American descent are also at high risk.
The key is to take the right solution as soon as cancer is detected.
Can be both aggressive and aggressive.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him possible options, without mandatory prostate cancer treatment, which does not pose a life risk in the long term, but by making choices, in these cases, in favour of active surveillance of the disease.
To date, many men with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts progressing, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So, I would recommend that we do the test.
However, it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether the test is needed or not.
In cooperation with the International Urology Association, Mowembury has developed a tool to assess everything for and against the PSA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous reception to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if everyone had a good diet and had enough movement, 30 percent of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, this figure would have increased to at least 50%,” stresses André Bolje, the Spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are due to inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain entirely ambiguous.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of the cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It has caused enormous damage to human health.
"Now there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says André Bolje, Spokesman.
It is encouraging that 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, surplus weight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct intestines, vegetation, pancreas, and uterus.
“Scientific studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against fat kit cancer”, adds to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of fat intestine cancer.
Silver products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by digging, drying or salt can lead to carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to cancer,” explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But to date, the results of these studies cannot be considered unambiguous.
In the opinion of SCC, the studies of vitamin E yield controversial results.
If one showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
The impact of vitamin D on the development of vitamin D also lacks full clarity.
However, Mr. Bolio stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family anamnesia with the doctor.
"Drawing the analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in detail
Last summer, a report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs Boson has caused a real fusion - and not without justification.
It is believed that this bosson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, not much.
In addition, this is the last particle that was predicted in the Standard Model -- our best, or, in any case, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behaviour of the matter -- but which has never previously been detected by an experienced way.
But physics aren't sure that it's the Higgs Boson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very much resembling the Higgs Boson, predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, the new data presented this week at one major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
But let's say it's Higgs' Boson because the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to go through this rule, not even to try too hard, or to harm yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has the same law of a similar nature: the principle of the exclusion of Pauly, which will entice that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same point of time, if they remain in the same “quantine state”, is the “constituency”, in some characteristics.
On this basis, physics divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermentions, who are wisely in compliance with Pauly's principle.
In another, there are bosses, a vicious gang of anarchists, who have no respect for at least this principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same place calmly at the same time.
According to the site, the Particle Adventure Laboratory of Berkeley, these bosons are divided into two groups: mezones that we won't talk about here, and "particles of force" by means of which the fundamental forces of nature are distributed and some of the kind belong to the Higgs Bosson.
These very bozones, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as might be thought.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronique, it's because of one incredibly banal bozone: photon, or "part of light," which is the "curter" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, it "should" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, roughly like a stone thrown into the pond.
This "infrastructure" produces an electromagnetic wave (the light, or infrared radiation, or ultrafiolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than the photon, and hence one of the "power carriers".
A more stable field
The same happens to the Higgs Boson, with the only difference that, in order for this beacon to emerge, it must be "treated" by another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to build it, it is necessary to reach very and very high energy, as if it were about a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one that operates in CERN -- the Great Adron Collaider, a ring of 27 km diameter! -- to achieve such huge energy.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs Boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials are interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stick to the refrigerator alone.
Similarly, not all particles are interacting with Higgs field: those that interact have a mass, while others (as photon, by the way) do not have it.
So, what can "might" bring all these studies, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to instil a difference between observations and GM forecasts.
In addition, some of them yearn for such a discrepancy to be discovered, that the smallest inconsistencies can open the door for "new physics" and close some of the model holes.
The latter, to be said, still has significant shortcomings without any explanation for gravity (w!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80 per cent of the universe.
But yet there's no such discrepancies in the CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies for the average person's daily life are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that he is not.
Look, at the beginning of the 1960s, the Laser Research pioneers in Bell's laboratories could not even assume the revolution that would cause them to work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell's Laboratorys, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (presided as pulse) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered rather as the Laboratory Gadget.
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for the research toolkit.
For example, the same William Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not originally intended, now serves as a “eye” for all digital cameras of the world and deserves the Nobel prize of physics 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Big Adron Collider will necessarily change our life, but it only shows, really, that everything can be.
POLITATIVE Aid is the best way to die... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The Commission for Decent Death had recently discussed the sensitive question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon and the bill is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Dolg" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monterage.
The prostate cancer that destroyed it from within gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in beds in the palliative care shelter of Victor Gadbua in Belay, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job — an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table on which an appetite lunch is on, he surrenders and agrees to help him to eat.
He stays awake, even smiling, talking to strangers who work around him, making medicines, and taking him to the bathroom.
Courage before normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhoea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"In life we are taught that a man should urinate standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbua.
Reflect to the condition of the child, for some, unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to accept the fall, he claims.
Since many people who are engaged in palliative care are of the view, important events are also at the very height of the fall.
Patients who go to Victor Gadbua's palliative shelter are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called "medical."
Ms. A., 89 years old, most feared to die “in consciousness of suffocation”.
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before she leaves her to put a mask that makes breath easier.
She continues to await the last visit of her son from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor Hadbua, care for the body and nutritional assistance are provided with the assistance of a group of volunteers.
It's a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
It's very little because we're all gonna die sooner or later.
Here life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
Be comfortable physically, emotionally, or emotionally.
We will agree to give the dying one the mouth of brandy or paps to see what he asks for.
Diabetics are no longer required to control the level of sugar.
And death is part of the day-to-day.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
His son drank that beer in the feet of the deceased in the morning.
"We're helping the loved ones as well as the patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of care for the patients.
There's no day in Victor Hadbua's shelter like the previous one.
Along with a 93-year-old who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, putting his pillows on his toast in his honor, a tragically young man dies 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two little children and tested everything to survive.
"In the past six months, between three and five cokes, always employed by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gaddbua ' s shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians are said to have no access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who entered the final stage of their life, whether at home, at the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Hadbua ' s shelter and the Big Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less solely in caring for cancer patients.
It is this great gap in Quebec's health system that makes many health professionals fearing the enactment of a law legalizing eutanasia and suicide assistance.
Beginning in October, a manifest signed by lights in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfur Maunt and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant and showing their disagreement with this initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative quality care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I've seen a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance office in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists have tried to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hopes of surviving Ellen Richard were already minimal when she stopped boring chemotherapy.
When I told my tutorial that I was stopping the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping the fight, she said.
At the same time, she told me herself that my days were counted!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are due to the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team makes their pain easier.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not completely all-powered in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of Paliative Care at the Big Montreal House, the patients are not sensitive to dehydration in 8 per cent of the cases.
At the very end of the lifetime, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or permanently.
No longer can we pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to alleviate the pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
The pain-affected people always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be evtanased," it means "I want me to get easier."
This report was made possible by a journalist grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fundkeepers and Italian Mafia specialists say every day what they know about a huge “system”, an entrance to the construction industry, public officials, politicians, trade union figures and mafios.
“Industry”, which was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how this system wakes up after all the money has been put in motion, Jacques Duscheno, the deputy and the former Chief of the Monreal Police."
It was in 2011 that a scandal emerged as a side result of the investigation of official crimes relating to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of Liberia, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
Ducheno's report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the start of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, only the Ministry of Transport would retain billions of dollars on contracts”, if some were to deter their instincts to take their share.
The Sharbonno Commission “had already held two mayors”, he added, hoping she would be able to “open the schemes behind individual individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, included a wide state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the Special Unit of the Molot, which had forced Montreal's East Cartel after 2009, to cease the overstatement of contracts.
A series of searches have been made over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotto mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Jil Wyancour, recently resigned from the post of mayor Lavaly, the third largest city of Quebec.
He was suspected of having received bribes repeatedly while ordering public orders.
In addition, several engineers were formally charged with the routes of Montreal and the construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accquo and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded the present bomb by investigating the “system” of obtaining public contracts.
Over a few years, Zambito paid 3 per cent of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to some mediator associated with the Mafia, who, in turn, remitted the money of the Mayor of Gerald Tramble “United Montreal”.
In the 2000s, Zambito blew money to the right and left, listing more than $88,000 (about Euro68,000) to various province parties, mostly Liberians, who were then in power.
In addition, he confessed that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sanitation contracts overestimating costs
In Montreal, the corruption system worked unreservedly.
Jille Surprenan, a former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the commission: he received ten years of gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournament, restaurants, Hokkey and bribes, a total of $736,000 in exchange for sewage contracts he overstated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they received a paw overscoring from 30 to 40 per cent with false supplements.
Then, an organizer from the mayor party, Martian Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned early in November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first members in Montreal to be disturbed.
The Mayor of Rivier de Préri, east of the island, has been countering the sale of a municipal property purchased for $5 million and resold for a... 1.6 million builders in the construction boom since 2010.
70% of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in an investigation which would eventually begin, she would "take out for a thread to understand the operation of an ant system to stop the gangren and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as “indulgent but positive”.
We are in the process of clearing the wounds, but Montreal will need to have its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of doubtful practices.
How we get out of the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno observes for his part that “the employers have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but he is particularly concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about this scheme”, but who did not participate in the scheme.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the electoral campaign in Quebec was 70%, he joked, "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to 100 dollars of donation to parties, but he said that this would not change the situation: “Since we do not strictly limit the costs of the election, there will be dirty money in politics”.
It requires a complete restructuring of the State contracting system and the financing of the parties: “We cannot go down below; with boldness, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If that story is a shadow of the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls on those who laugh at to look into their own yard...
"PSW - not the FC Barcelona!"
At this season, you've reached a great scale in the SWG.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but may also be the new dimension of the SPW.
Great players arrived.
I'm growing with them every day.
Technical staff also contributed much.
These factors make me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's all going on very fast in football.
But I'm not splitting up.
From the outset, I've always walked forward in the centre of the NIF in Clerfonten before I came to St. Etien.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
It's not a news to play a very high-level match this summer.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be at the level and put up at the maximum.
Carlo Anchelotti also supports my position.
He is assisted by such deputies as Claude Macelle, who played the same position as me.
Anchelotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Anchelotti is a source of respect for all technical staff.
Today, in the First League, he is unequal and is among the best trainers in Europe.
He's got a lot of experience, and he won a lot of titles with high school clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring Paris' new titles.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a series of trauma.
The trust he has given me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of part one of the SWF season?
Lyon took the leader's place in the First League.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Championes: we have been effectively qualified to one eighth of the finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, before Porto, in order to be able to take the one-eighth match.
Could the SCW be a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needed to win titles and secure a long-term perspective.
That's not true today.
Financially, SCW has funds to make the project real.
Not taking titles in the First League, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship.
Last season, we were close to that.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything we could do to get to the finish.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points are called champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it'll be all right.
Despite the fact that there are strong teams like Marseilles, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting for too much of the U.S.S.S.?
It's normal that we're looking forward to a lot, given how much we've invested and what players we have.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troy and we find ourselves finding what to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We're wondering what people expect of us first and foremost.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FK Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce the game.
The command is formed over time.
We have proved in the League of Championes that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't been able to go to one eighth of the seasons, even though they've spent huge money!
In view of the amounts we have invested, we have represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be disrespect for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseilles, who weren't at the altitude of the last season, were "intensified" by these new SWS.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The SCW seems to be completely dependent on the vigor of Zlatan Ibrahimović.
Well, if they say there's some kind of "Glathanodependence."
It just means that Ibrahimović is very successful and that he's beating a lot of heads.
He came for this and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a big player and a star of the world.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exclusively what he did.
This also encourages others to improve their games.
Tiago Silva, one of the best advocates in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with France's collection?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to participate in that Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from breaking down a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today, I'm able to play a good selection match.
That's what I was hoping for since I was baptized at the Blue.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we must now be exemplary.
What do you think of the first months of Dead Dasham's head of the Blue?
They're good for him.
He has a good position in the selection group to the world championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players, and he's inspiring to win.
What was Laurent Blan?
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal, he has qualified us in Euro.
I hope Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved one (1-1) who was expelled in Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in himself.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had no matches like that in my career.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Full contrast to the current cash exchange based on centrobanks, numbered transactions between recipient parties with commission charges for processing them.
Furthermore, the frequency of these technologies is evident in the political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudoni) is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros ...) and a secure protocol of exchange by type of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between the participants of the same level.
Some 200,000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
A number of thousands of sites are used to bid to make donations or as a payment fund.
By reaching a maximum of $30 (Euro 23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, before returning to about $10 today (the toures are shown on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special in comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currencies published in October was interested in the system.
He describes the bitcoin as the most successful virtual currency, the “competing with the dollar or the euro” and the “conforming to the normal currencies”.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to move on to video games that are earned in the game or can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook Social Network has also developed a system like this.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by a central authority.
In Bitcoin, all network knots are both accountants, auditors, currency emitts, buyers and sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two e-mails.
Only for each new payment can the user choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcocks used in the transaction are in fact in a public account book sent throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It comes through the mathematical task sent to computers that, like the temporary central bank, have been privileged to add this new line.
This is the phase of the file's heating, that is, transforming a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number before they put it together.
The objective is to find a number that gives a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes easily check out what it is right.
Transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If for the purpose of deception the user wanted to pay twice as much as the same money, only one of these two transactions would have been confirmed by the network - and the other would be unconfirmed because they had different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem is getting 50 bits of horses.
In order to avoid inflation, the prize is regularly shared in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcones in treatment is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided up to one hundred million, leaving the reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computational capacity.
The life of the network has survived the raids and the falls.
The Bitcoin websites were attacked and the Bitcoin were stolen from the reserves.
“The defect used does not apply to the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a paying company with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also possesses this shortage.
Large players like Wikipedia refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress blog form, are allowed to do so.
Recently, Adie Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Institute of Weitzmann in Israel, analyzed the account book and found that almost 80 per cent of the Bitcoins were not in circulation.
The Giant Springs were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works in Coinabul, who is engaged in the conversion of bitcayons into gold.
Pierre Nouaza, another author of the Currency Benefit, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or uncontact payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is only enough to report a address that can be "photographed and detected" by the phone, clarifies Pierre Nouaz, assured that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in the revision of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, proposes, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are considered to be higher today if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capacy and Suribi).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to re-establish control over its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not only in our hope.
We were mostly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And we are with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajikis.
They are tolerated, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer be as soon as the West acts more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the height of hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There's no Taliban attack on Kabul since the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed from the time of their insurmountable move from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
They were then perceived as a kind of release, a return to security.
The Afghan women were paid for the margins of these peasants, which exceeded Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our day.
The former modjahedes, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to hold women in their subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become pilgrims that take over State land to resell returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge United States subcontracts.
They have been discredited; most of them have not even fought themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that's not a thief.
Many young people want to leave as those who have made American generosity — capital flow.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; in Kabul, there are now 5 million people, one fifth of the population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled with both boys and girls.
These young people should be provided with jobs that would not want to return to the morbidity of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militia, loves mobile phones, television, and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, which are seen everywhere.
There is now an army.
The authorities that will command her, will they be considered to be legitimacy?
The old commanders in the anti-Soviet struggle have already taken steps to rehabilitate provincial wives who do not subordinate to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be somewhat decentralized, as was the case in Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized State with strong presidential power, rescinding the Prime Minister, who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s and even before, depends on foreign assistance.
Industry was not placed on its legs, no dam operates, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority was given to the private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that western countries were present there only to get possession of them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transportation to export through mountains, there is no mining of minerals.
The Chinese had almost left the Mie Mes Inak deposit, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and to remain the largest provincial employers.
There is also a need for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations on a single day of equality.
The withdrawal of French military units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls ' face, boys, French-language faculty at university, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in the pursuit of “conquesting hearts and minds” and in the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military-civil activity” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public activities and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in tens of mountainous villages.
These work, with intensive involvement of the local labour force, helped to contain revolt: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of soils and increased arable land.
What are we going to keep in mind by spending two billion euros on military expenses?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often at a height of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capisas.
In order to get rid of the rebellion led by foreign factions, the farmers, as I was told, need to provide them with a small non-military support that would be well controlled and directly controlled.
Heavier births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risk of President Mohammed Murcy.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily empowered it with extraordinary powers, it had decided to play the bank.
Constituting everyone offended, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Soon after two years, Egypt had relied on the preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which had weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
In the opinion of his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic confusion”, continuing to “reflect the word” and “to violate the right”.
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by expediting the transition process.
The referendum should take place for fifteen days.
A very short period of time that makes the brothers refuse to explain to the Egyptians the article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morcy seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in a interview to American Time Week.
The more appeal for an accelerated vote comes to an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, “If you vote for my text, or if I leave myself with extraordinary powers”, which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberians did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they rattled the door, feeling unable to communicate their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 sparers were quickly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, added to the fact that one of the few discords of the day had arisen around... the time for prayer, since some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly had been wrong.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consisted of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2, ultimately, remained an identical article from the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the Shariah's principles are the main source of law”.
The Salaphist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would allow them to be more strictly applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Licemoria," answers liberals who see in it only a pier.
Because, in their view, the Islamicization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point particularly to article 220, which provides advice to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the verification of the conformity of Sharia laws.
According to a specialist in Egypt, Sophie Pomeie, this is a source of concern, that is, “people who are to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can watch the theocratic birth."
Many liberals are also impressed by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be less moderate than the present.
“There is no particular religious interference at this time.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ullas, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," is soothing Alexis Bloux, who prepares a dissertation for the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he recognizes that “art. 220 may be confused, since the terms used therein are borrowed from religious lexics.
This applies in particular to “fixes” [Islam jurisprudence].
In the future, the question may arise as to the extent that civil judges are competent to decide on it.”
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday is criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers argue that they have declined considerably compared with the old regime.
Another controversial point: powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be considered, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be harmful to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been retained and insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
Furthermore, none of the articles speak of the protection of a woman, stresses Heba Moraif, from Human Wrights Watz.
She said that the prohibition of torture in article 36 was the only positive point.
A word that has not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to be on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled today in the afternoon.
Heads of State, in turn, will go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaiting holy places, the Pump of the Earth and the Sea from the lush
The earth of the Promised One unites the majesty of Bible truths, the modern comfort, and the paramount nature.
The AIF identified five of the most important reasons for going to Israel.
Worship Sacred Places
We should go to the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace is jeopardized on all those who go to this shop.
Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the wedding of water into wine, the passage of water, the soothing of the storm, and the filling of the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all, the sanctuaries in Jerusalem.
The believers here follow the Skorby Way or Jesus ’ Cross Way (latin Via Doloroza).
It begins with Antonia - Pratorium, where there was a courtship, and on the streets of the Old City brings to the Temple of the Ground of the Lord on Mount Holgof, to the place of Spokesaw, the Stone of Anointed One, and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pump of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem is built in a place where, according to Christian legend, a tree was raised from which a cross was made to crucify Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentation, remaining from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
By tradition, people of different religions leave notes here with desires that are then fulfilled.
Traveling Vertically
The ruins of Massad’s fortification remained a secret refuge from the enemies Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are situated on wet rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
And only those who are admired by the Alpinism can reach them.
The rest of them are brought to this historic peak by a rope-road lift.
In the north of the country, 1600 - 2040 metres are the famous mining resort of Hermon, where, during winter months, there is a huge influx of tourists.
He's got a bus shuttle from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the mining traffic is 45 km.
Ancient tradition suggests that pagan gods lived on the top of the mountains.
Visit the Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You're not going to all for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are to visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the Cave of the Jewish Desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It's also worth visiting the Tel Aviv Art Museum.
His exhibition is widely presented by the canvas of impressionists and expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sysleiah, Matissa, Modiljani, Shagala, Picasso.
At Acca, you can visit the Al-Bash Museum, which is a number of ancient Turkish bands with the mules of visitors and banners of the time.
In Кейsaria, we should go to the unique private Rallie Museum, where we can enjoy the sculptures of Daley and Roden.
There's no tour guides and souvenir benches.
The entry is free and no donations are categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Your Museum in Tel Aviv, tells us about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the child memorial, is in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you're in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Hebrew children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Get healed.
Three major Israeli resort zones are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each has basins, aquaparuses, dolphinaria, and oceanry.
Interestingly, even during winter months, the Red Sea is bathed because the temperature of the water there is not below 21 degrees of heat and the air is heating up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is warmer, and it is swimming for a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the world -- 417 m below the ocean level.
The lazurous water in it is a radar that easily keeps the swimmer on a swim at all.
Looks around are unreally beautiful.
They go through the treatment of salt water, rasps, and medicinal muds, and treat health with dermitis, allergies, asthmas, extrems, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetes to make order for the shattered nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancient Times
They are kept by the ancient Tel Aviv city of Jaffo on the Mediterranean.
Through it, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia came along the famous Maritime Way.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Persei saved the beauty of Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists are very fond of breeding on narrow streets named after Zodiak's marks.
They say if you touch the walls on the street, Fortuna will be favored.
Youths who come from all Israel and even other countries to the photo session can be met in Jaffo.
And in Casaria, the city of King Herod, you can go to the Roman theater, "take" the ceremonies.
During the Roman period, Kaisariah was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully refurbished theater is now used for evening concerts and operas.
Popup Notes
While traveling to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the people in the country know Russian.
It is better to take the money for the trip, not in the euro, but in the dollars that are easy to exchange for the shekel (now US$1.8 to Shekel).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a speed tram, and in Haifa the only subway line in the country consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground funiciller.
All types of urban transport cost six shekels for which transplant can be travelled for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is celebrated by Jewish tradition on Saturday.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation cease.
And Sunday morning begins work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels, only kosher food, excluding pigs, seafood, fish without chechei and dishes, where milk and meat are mixed.
It offers a large selection of ramanine and beef dishes, soups and desserts prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish humus paste, varied sauces, hammer balls, falalal, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that're "wallowing themselves."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlines love human places and do not give up on feasts.
Rental of the car, depending on the mark, would be between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 per day.
And the bike's going to be 15 pieces a day.
The museum tickets are an average of 30 shekels.
The language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
The U.S., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine were the most visiting and resting citizens.
On Earth, from January to October 2012, 118,8,000 Ukrainian tourists were visited, 51 per cent more than 2010, before the abolition of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Strong" to Moscow will prove that migrants are digging money into language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that the compulsory language testing law would give rise to fraudulent identity certificates
In Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russian cities, 13 million Gastarbyterboyers arrive each year.
Most of these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left in the homeland.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force that each migrant worker would be obliged to pass an examination for the Russian language.
To date, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the areas of services, housing, housing, housing and retail.
In time, however, the PFM promises that the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
But not only the language, but also Russian history, and the basis of the law.
The knowledge of language will have to be confirmed for obtaining and for extension of work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries where Russian is a public language.
The law is not subject to the law and the people who have been able to obtain authentics and diplomas prior to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, predestination and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian Language of Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, IHL, SPBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrant tests will be available in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The prosecution initiative was supported by the Deputies of the Lord and the FMS.
And human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have asked the press a lot of times, what will it do?
What will change the boundability of learning the language both for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service responds to this will reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery.
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of labour migrants, explaining the head of the Russian FMS office in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment can 90 per cent address the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in the case of migrants without a profession, unable to learn a language without medical examination.
Without the understanding of the language, Sébelov is sure, the future migrants are destined to face unfair people who, under the form of help, will move their “travel” into a grim close bark, where he and his dozens of such ones will chase for months without food and documents, encircling between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing in their home, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken off passports, they do not pay the promised salary," confirms the Chief Directorate for Labour Migration of Tajikistan Tolib Sharip.
Don't fight, militant!
However, as long as many citizens of the Middle Asian Republics who are going to Russia for earnings, it is recognized that not only do they not know the language of the country they seek, but they also work hard to write for their own.
Of course, it's not as much their fault as the trouble: a few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajikis can afford even an accurate primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, not to mention the proper dress, clothing, and equipment to school.
As they reach teenage age, they are employed at the earliest opportunity.
It is hard if they do not know the tongue, they are admitted.
"You feel humiliated and underestimated."
Indeed, with regard to the law on the language of human rights defenders, one important point has been made.
Only those who have legal status will be tested.
If the status does not exist, there will be neither an examination nor a subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the Hastarbeyers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Please welcome, or the outside entrance is banned."
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic and still the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is worth between 12 and 16,000 roubles.
And then, false registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, we have no registration, here are cases of extortion.
"Please a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he told the journalists, Umed Hytadamov citizen of Tajikistan.
"Fly out, don't be boring, buy painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that not only migrants ' registration documents were false.
Several "lip" linguistic test certificates have already been removed by FMS staff.
Fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they did not come to the new owners: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier for themselves to perform the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is twice as expensive as the formal testing procedure: it will cost three thousand labour migrants.
In that the main challenge is to protect the system from corruption soon, so that the shorts cannot be purchased, both the authorities and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise the Gasstrebyttis who have not been able to pass the test successfully from the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be invited to work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
IMD does not trafficking in the illicit arms market
The proportion of legal weapons crimes is extremely low
The Russian Ministry of Internal Oversight Services proposes to strengthen the law on civilian weapon owners.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoots at weddings without casualties, and to kill seven people killed by Moscow's lawyer Dmitriy Vinogradov.
The police want to prohibit trauma in public places and raise the age from which a weapon licence can be obtained from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption of Irin Yarovya and promised that amendments to the weapon law would be made to the Lord in the near future.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by “gatekling”.
An open letter has emerged in the network, whose authors, the representatives of the various civil scourge organizations, demand that the “unreasonable tightening” be abandoned.
A percentage of the weapon-registered bullying, stated to the Russian Bibisi Bar Criminal Basil Lesnikov.
According to data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 firearms crimes were committed in six months of 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not place the offender in the black market.
Now, they say, any weapons at a low price can be found in Moscow.
In the meantime, the IDP claims to control the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The Black Market of Weapons is filled in several channels.
The five main channels, says the Colonel at the resignation of Victor Barants, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and Henstabe for ten years.
A screenshot of a gun ordering site
The first is an Army or a military track, that is, a gun that was stolen during the fighting on the Caucasus.
"The Russian officers and the Caucasus themselves pulled out the outer,," says Barants.
The next type of black weapons is stolen by criminals from the forces.
Baranzek explains that the police warehouses are also included and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "flies" are sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses have often experienced explosions.
"There are proven versions that part of the firing was made specifically to cover the shortage," said the former military.
According to Branz, the weapon manufacturers make their contribution.
“Private weapons plants are now being produced, which do not stand up for competition in the international market and throw weapons from underground to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of black market is smuggling.
Especially do guns and machines from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzsia.
"There's its own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia that organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where's the weapon?
The experts considered the nearest share of each of the sources of illicit arms in the black market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rostata, criminal literature, and open portals on weapons issues.
The vast part of the illegal weapons are written by researchers, coming from the army and the forces.
Half of all weapons in the black market were found there “by fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, the report states.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons originating from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases of weapons-producing abductions, and 5 per cent of the cases of black archaeology.
A consultant seller of one of the weapons stores who asked him not to call his name is assured that the weapons found by black miners have long been unpurchased - too old.
Most often, he says, the new party sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through a flag, a person buys a unit, such as a gun TT.
He's being handed out, handed over through the fence.
"He's transporting it to town and selling it 900 euros per thing with two stores," he says.
“Really, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically, when the plan for the disclosure of crimes is burning, the illegal arms dealers are under control,” adds the consultant.
"How's the luxury store?"
The seller and buyer are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at the websites, on the blogs, until a friend who offered to come to the Bogovaya platform, where there's a man who's going to take me to the corner where we're going to trade.
The price of the trunk I only found out there.
Military observer Victor Baranzez
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consulting salesman.
There are market sellers, but there's also a need to come, impliedly, "from Ivan Ivanović, who asked me to tell her that she had a tooth falling out."
I'm even getting a couple of cassettes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He's only giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
Newborns are searching for weapons in various ways.
Former military Victor Baranzee tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article on this subject for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photographs where everything was "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer says, "No cat is offered in the bag, you can try everything.
I'm a potential client, not just buying, we're going with a seller to the woods, we're putting a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that guns are good, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Magazine on the couch
Internet searchers are sending them to websites and groups at Vontact, where they offer to buy weapons for different purposes.
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
"Sufficient to have a certain amount of money," they write in a advertisement hat on the "Building a gun or a gun."
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
And the minors will be sold?
"No license, of course," asks Ivan user (orthography retained).
"T.Mosqua's "Culle of T.T." is concisely formulating the Fedorrenca request.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of base site sites and those wishing to buy weapons with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish to feed and then get a coal to Siberia.
Military inspector and former military Victor Baranz
I've heard of these patterns: the site is usually registered outside Russian laws.
People get orders.
The buyer is paying the bathroom.
"The answer is to send a photograph and an instruction where weapons are hidden," says Dmitry Kislov, the Spokesman of the Public Organization "Right on Arms."
Viktor Barants claims that leaving the application on the website, it is possible to stay without weapons and to get behind the grid.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of base site sites and those wishing to buy weapons with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed and then get coal in Siberia," he claims.
Macarov for $100
Experts estimate that the amount of between $100 and $900 can be credited for the purchase of illegal small arms.
According to Dmitry Kislov of Arms, McArov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage stocks by the management of these medium-level warehouses.
According to the official stast of the department, the number of such crimes for Russia as a whole declined by 7 per cent in January to October 2011 to 22.9,000, while the number of detected theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fastfud workers and supermarkets battling
The Macdonalds work runs up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart Corporation and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as "Makdonalds," "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendis" and "Centukki Fred Chicken."
Until no one predicts whether this wave will turn into a ninth valve or it will breathe in early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages earned by a number of Walmart employees and the rapid feeding system, the aim of protesters is to establish trade union organizations in them.
Until now, this sector of the economy is almost covered by trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The events began last week, after the Day of Thanksgiving, in the so-called Black Friday, when a cheap sales orgy broke out to America, captured millions of hunters and sometimes accompanied by tattoos.
On that day, some Walmart Corporation employees, with 2.2 million workers around the world, left their jobs and piceted with trade unions and left activists in company stores whose goods are dissolved by people of modest and medium-sufficiency.
Walmart sells to everyone in the world, from guns, hunting guns and car batteries to dust, eggs and milk.
His stores averaged 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many of Walmart’s low-paid employees are being abandoned at work alone.
The availability and assortification of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods in part because it pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult working conditions, such as the shortage of loaders or manual scanners.
The shares on Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and reported that the cost of the insurance provided by the corporation had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
The typical Walmart employee who's got $9.5 per hour, that spending isn't at all, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart increases the average wage to $12 per hour, it will cost a corporation of $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she's spending on her wages now.
If Walmart's entirely shifts the increase in payroll to buyers, each visit to the store would cost them only 46 cents more.
They'll spend some $12.39 a year more than now.
The advocates of Walmart suggest that protests took place in only nine states and did not harm corporations.
The Black Friday continued in her shops from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. of the next day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 goods a second.
In total, its cashiers performed almost 100 million transactions on the Black Friday.
The representative of the Corporation, Dan Fogelman, argued in an interview with Huffington Post, that the jobs had left a total of less than five Walmart employees, and that the protest was just the "ordinary piar-trick" of the organization of her trade union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart (them in this progressive city are not complaining, and so they are not yet here), but the Macdonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn't even give you hospitals and pays you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, member of the New York hive
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Rapid dietists increase, but a little, and on average, their employees receive 8.90 dollars per hour in New York.
No one earns less in this dear town.
How you can live in New York for that kind of money, it's incomprehensible for me.
At one time, almost a quarter of American teenagers were going through the Macdonalds, who worked for their post-school counterparts, living with their parents.
Few saw the basic source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly pushing on an interview with the Macdonalds employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal forum, a commentary is made that the author notes that it is irresponsible to bring children up if you don't know what you're feeding them.
Participants who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at Makdonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that the cashiers and cookers pay at least 15 dollars an hour, that is, more than double their current minimum wages.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of rapid nutrition.
The American Law prohibits the administration from impeding and punishing the activists of the trade union movement with idlers and dismissals.
On the other hand, the Administration rarely facilitates their lives.
However, it is difficult to reach out to the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the unique turnover of staff.
Inconsistent
The noise protests were held on that day and in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the stock was in the middle of the day at the Makdonalds meeting next to the Times Square, where several local democrat politicians spoke, in particular, a member of the hordest of Jumain Williams, who said, "Makdonalds" says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn't even give you hospitals and pays you for honest work."
Other eminent New York Democrats, such as the mayor of the city of Bill De Blascio, have supported the demonstrators, which stated that “we must be friendly in supporting fast-food workers so that they can achieve the fair pay and economic well-being that everyone in New York deserves!"
As the New York Times described, this was the biggest act of this kind in the history of the American fast-food world.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, but not all of them were employees of a fast common drink in New York where tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
Until it is clear whether this spark will produce a mass flame.
"When the brain is deceived, it's going to be middle."
Recently, the topic of complementary reality has been widely accepted among the advocates of modern technology, mainly through the prism of special points.
First, at its annual conference in summer, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the relevant patent was also shown by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the leader of the 3D group in the Cambridge Laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Isadi, it is clear that for the scientists of this company, the glass is a step.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general, what's your research team doing?
- We're interacting with machines, but we're trying to break the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind stuck in the mass at the pixel phase on the flat screen, sometimes the thumb in them.
We would like to look at the 5-10 years ahead and foresee the dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost one Xbox today is not sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has shifted to a physical level, many things still occur on a flat screen, sometimes 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system gets more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change this, working on true three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design.
We have to release the computer world into our physical world to make it more tangible.
To do so, however, you need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice management?
Popular thing, but do they overestimate it?
He's definitely not a panacea, it's a matter of privacy, because he doesn't always want to tell others about his actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, we had a project for the management of devices in public places where we thought about gestures, but not the wavings, but these stiff, short.
However, the gestures were taken not by a camera of the device but by a handwritten bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and the muscles.
As long as it's big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the twisted hours.
But the future for mixed management, for example, a gesture+voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this bank of gas?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to something that the car can or cannot at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual convergence.
I think in the near future, we will mostly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to define human reactions more accurately.
It could be laser sensors, they give a good depth resolution, that's very important.
- If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your claim for modern cameras?
Doesn't have permission, depth, or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that can be pushed away in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1,000 s.
But it's not about the megapixels themselves, it's as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us -- it adds to the designers of algorithms.
So you should remember not only the X and Y resolution, but also Z.
The speed, the number of staff per second, is also very important.
Human movements are rather dynamic, and the current 30 k/s are frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betischez of our Redmond Laboratory made a touching sensor with a controlled delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of people and machines.
I'd be very useful in my work to the equivalent of this device, but not to be touched, so that the staff would be bigger in a second.
- You don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- There are three cameras in Kinect, one of which is actually an infrared radiation and the other is an infrared signal receiver.
And then the third camera is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not applicable to determining the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or to exacerbate it by increasing the required amount.
It would be advisable to create a flexible analog of Kinect, to play with the camera curves, and to see how this would help in a three-dimensional definition of the provision.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her glasses.
You don't think, from the point of view of the day-to-day use of the complementary realities of the glass is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, keeping the smartphone in your hands up, it's not very comfortable, but that's what I think is that the coolest option would be the "transition" complementary reality when on the cloud platform you could switch from points to smartphone, the projection display and beyond.
Points are a very personal device, that's their power (private things only see you), and at the same time the weakness -- an added reality based on points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- For a moment, let's say that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark from the Iron Man, but also to the mortal man.
There is one problem that often criticizes this idea: there is no tactical answer!
Hands don't feel anything!
What are your responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that the complementary reality is the seventh breakthrough in human interaction and the car.
I think the eighth might be a tactical supplement.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the other hand as a kind of counterfeit for the image.
She's very good at pushing!
But there's technology that really aims to give these pictures in the air -- for example, interference of a few ultrasound beams at a certain point where your finger is, but as long as it's very weak -- it's like you're going on a pillow.
There are bracelets on wrists that affect neural ends in their fingers, too, a promising direction.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
Make him think he feels like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge that has to be confronted for a long time, namely, to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is going through open, practically endless work and on concepts of leaking tracks (also not like clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
As long as the brain is being deceived, work has been done for many years.
That's what makes the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- a lot of things in a totally start-up state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt is continuing with the Petersburg Advance Project, which focuses on the citizens ahead in the outback of culture and art.
The top list has already witnessed the vivid artists of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, past all-rossian visibility.
The new Rosbalt hero is the epathy artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man, dressed in all the red, which occurs at the Russian museum, at the summer garden, and at the fashioned party and the vernisajas.
The paintings of Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators wherever they go.
Cyrill Miller is one of the purely peterburg social and philosophical tales, who create new mythology.
Cyrill Miller is a brilliant person of the petherburg advance in the late '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
In addition, he is a city man, by his appearance on the streets of a smile to the citizens, which raises all moods.
Recently, he had taken the ballman and became a peterburg sharkman, since he had been able to play this difficult role in all of his divine existence, philosophy and imimage.
Cyrill, why are you still walking around the city in all the red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I picked red as a designer of species and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although everything in society is almost grey, it causes aggression and inflammation.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative action is an invitation to the discussion.
- When did you realize it was supposed to be an artist?
- At the Nevsky DK exhibit where my work was put.
I realized it was my way.
At that time, the wave of old unofficial artists passed, and the new, free types of me were unclear.
I became friends with the new wave artists, with the post-gazone girl that led to "Pushkina-10," and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, dress, music, all the genres but a word.
It was important that I find myself at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative powers must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied the territory in Pushkinski-10, and there was a musical and artistic club, a goddess club, a house of the Peterburg godem.
Many were born there: SPOM, Tequila Jaz, I remember Schnoira being brought with the Uho Wang Gog project.
The corn and his friends sang light songs under the fonar, they were in an intimate triko, among them was the fashionable composer, Igor Wdovin.
When the group played alive, it became Leningrade.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes prior to the Khalli-Galian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and he's a big career, and basic education and upbringing we've got.
"D 137" Gallery, the Griboids Club, is a call from Art Clinic.
Our employees and all-time workers are gone.
I'm a hero of last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, and the prize was "People of our city."
In the nomination of the Yearbook, I was called, my culmination ended.
In new times, it's uncomfortable to work under old rules, I'm a human of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
Nowadays it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characterized by your learning manner.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they're highly relevant and sharp.
I'll have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a modern category.
I've been social before, now I'm hurt and scared.
But in the clowns, the tragedy is getting rid of.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace by totalitarian transformation is ordered.
Now they meet on clothing, focusing on the outer mechanics, not on the inner person.
Maybe you can't give him a hand in the face.
And the deceit will be removed by reeducation.
And recently we saw you as a city sharkman, and the Cultural City must have a hero like that.
Who, I don't think, should be them.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art now has to be careful, tactical, sweet.
Cultural disintegration is proceeding.
In the past, people fought in the race, the godem one loved, the prostitutes were different.
Now, everyone's broken into the microcommunications, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a worthless paper so everyone likes me.
Now you have to think who you're gonna like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Mikhail's Stas!
- He's got broods, he's got sex and social work.
And on cultural grounds 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, money, everything will chaste.
I have some worshipers, and the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what you're buying.
As a young man, I wrote paintings that one collector had them on the wall next to Falk and Larion's hangings.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Nowadays, concepts are often confused.
They say that the culture is spiritual, the culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a culture man of yesterday, I grew up in the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, relinquished money for painting painting.
I'm a culture like that.
- Cyrill, what's not enough for Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There's a notion: a civil official from culture.
But not every one of them can be acquainted with culture.
In the case of right kings, the kings may not have understood much in their culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're strangled, because we need higher experts who will appreciate these experts correctly and give them the way.
Now the taste is flourishing.
The same Erart, but they're different from what they're honestly saying that not all modern art we're taking, there's artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you, Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's soil.
It's hard to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, that's wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who are curious. They're going to exhibits, concerts.
We've got this layer of thin.
We need to make fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented on St. Petersburg grant funds
Birth in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
A spacecraft carving with landmen on board is being sent to the search for a spare planet.
To preserve humankind, there is a major question: how can we continue to be born in vague conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be learned at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” considers Vladimir Surdin, Senior Scientific Officer of the State Astronomical Institute of P.C. Sternberg (GAIS).
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the venere is 500 degree temperatures.
You can only live at high altitude or in Venus orbit... in space.
Reproducing in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, there were plant experiments.
Four generations of orbited peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then you're going to have insects orbiting, tiny fly flies.
In 1979, eggs of quakes were sent to space to check how the embryo evolved under the conditions of vagueness.
We get a perfectly normal bird on our way out.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem that this bird must find resistance is that he must stand up on his legs and start moving”, explains RAN Vladimir Sichev, leader of the Institute for Medicine and Biological Problems (IBBP).
Without resistance, the birds were stirred.
In 10 hours, newborns had a full instinct.
Birds didn't react to the light and the sound.
And the trouble was there that they had died in the four days.
"And two times we kicked out the birds, and then we refused because we just couldn't work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the birds in space, Vladimir Sicev.
The last time the biological "minicczeg" flew in orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, the biostaff Bion will only be one-sexed.
There was a experiment with rats that were sent to space with a fetus already.
In fact, there's nothing supernatural.
"It was on biosatellites, but again it's a single experiment, and such research has to be done," notes Vladimir Siczev.
After the landing of space rats, there was a descendant.
But it is not yet possible to approach the issue of reproduction directly in outer space.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike beasts, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are conducted.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humankind has is the female organism.
Our tea is gone, and no one on Earth could say, "Will it continue after it flys into space."
Does she dare give birth to a child after that flight?
"No one answered this question," says Wahtang Wachcade, veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut, Valentine Tereshkova, gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988 a son was born in the second female cosmonauth of Svetlana Savikka, who had twice been in orbit and even worked in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, we have units of cosmonauts, who have all these long flights, and we have a good generation.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," is the result of a cosmonaut pilot, the Hera of the Soviet Union, the Hera of Russia, Valerius Polakov.
Nevertheless, humankind needs to seek new paths in biotechnology, protection against radiation, artificial gravity.
CPC hydrolaboratory is a mandatory flight preparation stage.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, astronauts are developing the skills of work in outer space.
Water simulates vagueness.
If for adults the water is comfortable, but still it's a strange environment, then for breast-borns it's a natural element.
The little emigrants seem to confirm that life on the land came out of the ocean.
There is a link between the baby being in the chilly fluid for about nine months, and it is easier to get used to the water.
It's logical, in principle, because from the moment of birth, from that first bath, it's only going to take two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says the breast-feeding instructor Marina Axenov.
In the words, if a child is more naturally ill for a child, gravity is necessary for a woman.
The muscles of the belly, the pelvis, and the ability to extract the fetus fall quickly.
All right, let's drop it, relying on kin stimulants.
You can, of course, go in a special cell to give birth, she can push him out.
"And then what?" asks Valérie Polakov's unrestrained questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of gravity, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot wear a special training suit as an adult.
He's just going to be deprived of what he's going to need.
"And this experiment that we're going to do with you, by admitting the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, completely disastrous human being to the Earth," the leader of the Bioethics Committee RAN Igor Pesta.
While the birth of children in space is a theory question.
However, it will be a reality later when the earthmen on their ships go to a distant planet that will become a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Chief Audit and Audit Office: The checking of the scheduling system failed because of the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, Czechia has good control bodies and, despite the availability of qualitative legislation, is lagging behind its application.
This statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the High Audit and Audit Office, from an interview to the Aktuáln.cz site.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I believe we lack”, commented on the current situation of Kala.
Such opinions provide a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of misconduct, Peter Craves' approach to the so-called scooter system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Citizen Democratic Party) would not bother the entrepreneurs with verifications - is it prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister may not be in a position to resist the work of the institutions that are obliged to verify and seek the fulfilment of the obligations”, states Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which legislation on State procurement of both countries was compared.
What was it about?
It's about a parallel test that we started, probably, two years ago.
More simply, European legislation asserts how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation and then applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even in an unfinished manner, there are interesting differences -- more simply, we may have "correct and infallible legislation", but in the practice of applying it, we agree with some of the parameters of Germany.
It follows that more and more refined rules are not sufficient to be established, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how does this project actually help you what it means for you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the refinement of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because that does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means receiving the appropriate item for a reasonable (but not always a low) price to avoid enrichment and perhaps criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to do that by lowering the order restrictions.
This system may be filled with papers so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the limitation did not decrease.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of legislation on public procurement.
How does the monitoring system operate in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CIA (Control and Audit Office) there, or does it work differently?
In the case of institutions, there, Bundesrechnungshof, as our CIA, is also a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
Moreover, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, that is, the audit and the federal levels, their system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only control federal money, we have public means.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As to local legislation, it's easier than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said definitely that it is the best in everything.
Is that because they're better at control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any advantage of co-operating with our office, would they?
In the case of domestic legislation, how have the amendments to the Law on Public Procurement affected your establishment, in some way the consequences have been manifested?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet been shown in our monitoring work.
Since we are monitoring the fact, there is a need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future checks -- we started using our new tool "developing the risk of inequality" through which we passed almost 14,000 government contracts, and we analysed them, and of course, these changes will be manifested there, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you believe that this law will benefit or increase the pressure on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will be “violent” and that they cannot be respected.
In the preceding rules, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with a regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in such a way?
I think it's not that way.
The system must exclude those who want to seize and abuse but not punish those who make a formal mistake without affecting the decision.
Such a system would only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP would not bother the entrepreneurs by checking the so-called scooter system.
"Shoot system" is forbidden or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister may not be in a position to resist the work of the bodies that are obliged to verify and seek the fulfilment of the obligations.
You can say, "We'll change this law and let it go," but you can't say we're pretending nothing's happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains some strict rules, as and what must be formally implemented, and that is right, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but it must apply correctly, which I think we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly through.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
Basically, they're in, but in some places, with more caution.
Carlovarese Land
This morning the roads in Carlovare were passed, but some of them were frozen and snowy.
Temperatures fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but a slight heat during the day.
The snowfall in the region ceased, with a small layer of lowlands alone.
However, the ridges of the Red Mountains lie about 30 centimeters of snow.
The information received from the regional road workers showed that the spots were lower because of the fog.
The highway R6 and the first class roads in the region are currently being held without restrictions.
However, carefulness is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All roads in Class II and Class III, including mountain tracks, are also in progress.
But some of their areas still have the frozen remnants of the frozen snow and the places of the freezing snow.
Particular attention is needed on high roads.
Pardoubitic and Krallovegradek
The Office of Czech Roads and Highways informs the Internet that some of the roads in eastern Czechia are in danger of starvedness, while mountain roads and highways may be found in the wetlands.
Provincial road workers warn drivers of a holode that can be formed especially at the heights of the Pardubitic edge.
Hollyde may be near Lanscrown, Usti al-Orlitzi, Policies, Switawi or Visco Mito, especially in the second and third grade roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located in Swetavi are processed by chemicals.
The snow is especially on the roads of Krconosche and Orlic Mountains.
The trafficked snow layer is on high roads in the Rikhnova and Trutnova areas.
In East Czech, the variable clouds without precipitation are today.
Temperatures usually range from negative three to plus one degree Celsius, a slight wind.
Plzene
This morning the roads in the Plsen province are passed, but the places need to be cautious and adapted to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
Drivers may encounter fog areas, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The road managers are now passing almost without restrictions, but they recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of Class I roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
In the southern Plot and Takhov, frozen sections can be found.
Second and third grade roads are wet, and in this case there is also a warning on the possibility of sliding sites.
Drivers must be cautious, especially on low-used roads in the Shumawa area.
The Olomousz land
The drivers headed towards the highlands of Olomoustz must today take into account the snow porridge on the road.
It remained following the use of chemicals in the Black Sead and on the road towards Videl Krshij.
In the night of the snow, road workers were forced to walk outside, according to road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other areas the roadside is usually unlimited.
"The residues of the snow lie in the heights of the Shumperk.
Driving drivers towards Essenika must bear in mind the presence of a snowstorm in the Red Sedle,” reported today to CHAN (Czech News Agency) the шумperk road control manager.
During the night when the roads were cleared, their colleagues from Essenica believed that the highways had remained naked and wet.
In Olomouk roads are unlimited, but in Sternburk drivers must be attentive to forest sites, where still humidity remains.
The Ustek Land, the Lybertz Land
Today, road workers from northern Bohemia report that some difficult passages remain.
According to information from the police database, in addition to a few spots with holly or snowfall, a mountain road is closed at a station from the Telniska in the Ustec province.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so the roads maintain snow and ice, especially in the south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, on the contrary, there are no problems, mostly dry roads.
Road complications are not yet reported.
Road workers report the appearance of a Hollow in the area of Stetti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for his education at night - the whole day was raining and tearing the snow, the night sky cleared and the freezing began.
The main road and road I/13 on the border of the Ustek and Libertz province are reported to be unfavourable.
Because of the snowy branches of the road itself, it was forced to close the road in Telnica in the Book.
Shimon Ornest: at concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy.
What do you think less than a month should the end of the world come?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people get so easy on.
Together with the The Tap Tap group, we're constantly joking on this subject and we're saying that we're the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to explain more about this to the readers?
It is a nationwide fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrave are in parallel.
They end, roughly speaking, at a time when the May calendar will end on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose 12 - hour belt is 12 hours earlier than we have.
Who thought that idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all invented with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect with the public on the situation in which we will once pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of shoe, shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world, and these things can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, and thus back to support us.
The Tap Tap group, together with other musicians, also carried out a hymn against the end of the world, which is called "Light End Cancels".
Will the favorite hymn to the YouTube audience at these Benefis Concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if everything comes and the end of the world does not come.
He's sung all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gymnas are also called in a direct ether of Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the clip of Tomas Ganak, also in Xindl X....
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other Persons of Czech Cultural Life, as we conduct many charitable events and concerts.
We are trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many like to work with us, they're curious.
What's going to be the benefit of a concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO Free Education Centre, we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlička Institute for the sixth year.
Teachers regularly attend Edlička school students and have fun and interesting events with them.
Students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we are thus trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the Edlička supplementary project, a separate building to which we will move with this project will arise in the future.
Several musical groups and performers will be present at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to draw up a programme that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irgy of Suhi.
For all details, see www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grand-forces” in the future?
In May, we're going to make our first presentation at the Prague Spring festival and, of course, we're going to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be pleased to make a presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago personally if we were in the United States.
With regard to the border, you've had serious plans, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the organization’s pathway and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first sight.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the baggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and boxes with tools.
The Czech NSA airlines and the British Airways airlines have always been great for us, and I have been amazed for many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without trouble.
As a result of travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you experienced to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, we have witnessed in Russia that we are still at the baseline in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are very many barriers, and there is still a man's autonomous movement on an electric wheelchair in the middle of the city.
Nor are the banal things that go the way of the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, what should be our constant need to reach out to the leading countries?
There's a lot of things that's far behind the level of execution.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's okay that people with severe disabilities move themselves on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very popular that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, and that's what we're doing with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier is one thing, but when we have known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then things will really change.
As long as it's unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you do in 1998?
I went to the Edliki Institute as a tutor, and there were lots of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and I'm playing a saxophone, my colleague and I organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our leader Lady Angelović says, it's a little out of control.
So popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
True, we have been helped to join the famous singers in actively working on the propaganda group.
We have come to the conclusion that work that no one can evaluate is essentially as if there were no work.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so forth.
Was the goal of spinning the Tap Tap so good?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in Shaw business that imitate each other.
This is logical, all newly accepted with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, is natural...
But this pity is completely out of place, because people with disabilities are not somewhat suffering and all the abandoned individuals we must regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities have something to do, it's a shift not only for them, but also for the whole society.
Have you succeeded in being a rigid leader, as many believe you?
If we want to do work in a qualitative way, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic outlook and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they should go to rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they're very quickly losing enthusiasm.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
The Tap Tap Tap is currently composed of twenty persons.
How many were early in 1998?
Just one Ladja Angelović.
We're an open group, people come and go away, it's impossible to prevent.
Our doors are always open to those who have will and will.
It will be held in the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The conference will be held at Incheba Stadium in Prague, in Brno at the Fléda Club and in Ostrave, in the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by television at the time the Tap Tap Tap "Light Ends."
The project aims to collect funding of 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO Education Centre at the Edlika Institute in Prague.
It's 400 kroner tickets for children under the age of 12, and you can buy tickets in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the countries of the former eastern bloc (after Czechia, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and had actively participated in a number of agency projects over the years.
But Poland's way to space started much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, lecture A. Sternfelda, which presented ideas in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from its innovative work “Introduction to Space”.
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after several years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltra and André Luis Hirsh for the “Introduction to Astronautics” in France.
Dr. Jan Hadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist in astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these subjects.
The Hadomsky became a known world propagandist for cosmonauticism, and its contribution was appreciated, including by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named in his honor.
As early as 1925, a rocket-driven railway was built in Poland.
Regrettably, the author of the idea remained unknown, as was the details of the project.
It's not clear even that a rocket had to be used to unravel or braking the trolley.
Information about this drift is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery has begun to think about rockets.
The study was carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustave Mokzitski.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of the practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German forces, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the Specialized Press introduced the idea of the ID photoelectric missile proposed by the engineer Rogozinski, and the next year, the "Avstant Torped and Aviation Bomb Missile" by author Lelivi Kivoblozky was launched.
Both projects have been developed for the military use of missile engines.
The Tymczasowy Komitet Doradzo-Naukowy, who coordinated all the work, had been engaged in all military missile applications prior to the war itself.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, the work was over due to the commencement of the war.
The next scientific work on astronauts appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystvo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Astronautics”, which publishes four volumes of astronautics articles.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in astronautics.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already on track, and it was clear that space research was a forward-looking industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (PLA) has attempted to join the international astronautics Federation (based in 1951) and has become a valid member of the AAA autumn.
In the following year, the first Chairman of the PAA, Kaziмеж Záranquević (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
At that position, he remained until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, the PSA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch was on 10 October 1958.
A rocket capable of crossing a distance of 1,800 m was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was built and a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested in the summer of 1959 on the Blaedov desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already in a position to do this scientific work -- the RM-34 rocket could travel 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 was the heir of the first RM missiles.
The rocket was designed to be two-step, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designed as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from the size of the cabinet for scientific equipment.
The rocket Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 l, Meteor-1B 0.34 l and Meteor-1C 0.62l.
The maximum distance of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 rocket and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a 380 kg launch weight, was able to carry the useful cargo with a weight of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s entry into COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermasevsky became the second intercosmonauth after Vladimir Remec.
The revocation of the Public Work Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court revoked the law on public work.
The decision led to a lively discussion in society.
It would certainly be interesting to look at this problem from a broader perspective.
Liberally targeted economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, together with unconditioned financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of the labour force (wages), price stress arises.
This notion should be understood when the producer, through the delivery of cheap goods, is trying to stand up in economic competition by stirring up the value of a competitor to take away most of the market and thus increase his own income.
This means, on a large scale, for most entrepreneurs, either transfers of production abroad or cheap purchases abroad or disappearances, and increases unemployment in countries where the cost of labour is higher than in others.
Since private capital is not responsible for any social responsibility, including unemployment, the State's inevitable social costs are increasing.
In general, the situation exacerbates the unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that there is no need to bring specific statistics.
The unceremonious methods of private capital create a situation at the level of economies of individual States where Governments are compelled to compete with one another in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, Governments give their own population to private capital in spite of social deterioration.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the legislation in force.
The objective is to economically force its people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in labour law.
As a result, poverty and the difference between the poor and the rich are increasing.
For several years, there has been public distribution of food to the poor who have been unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As a result of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases where workers receive such wages that the State must pay to ensure that they have a living minimum.
This scandal has also been known to the public in the case of additional workers in Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU States undoubtedly lead to the same situation in which people under pressure from a catastrophic social decay are forced either to emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or to live on poor wages at the outskirts of society, hoping that private investment will ever come into the country.
But you're wondering where he's going to come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for European wages.
This is true in Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State cannot participate in its own economy, which is leading to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy.
Further, the question should be asked whether private capital, which is now almost the ruler of policies and the same State, is operating for its own selfish purposes.
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The existence of virtually all-mighty and widespread lobby in all States is proof.
As a result, we have a disproportionate situation in corruption, mutual benefit, in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment, but not a crime.
In the FRF, the situation is that government ministries, owing to lack of financial resources, are tasking the drafting of bills to private legal firms that are tightly linked to industry.
These bills then approve Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as stipulated in the Western Constitution, but from financially strong groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that a liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly found in a situation as described by the Appian in the Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompeii: “The State has long been dissolved and the authorities are engaged in violence.
Stones and swords are the bribes, the illegal receiving of graces.
Dying and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to elections with a pre-sold voice" "...mankind people did not at all run for the position of ruler, after all, one time the State left for eight months without a consul." "The serious thing was to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-government and the need to choose an energetic human being. "Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it became Caesar who finally replaced democracy to self-government.
As in ancient times, today’s society has its own unreasonable interests without taking into account public interest.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended to be used for public purposes.
The result is not different from the past: the unprecedented fall of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the fascist and Communist regimes is that we must look for a foolish liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, followed by the next tour.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we have already witnessed, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The revocation of the Public Works Act is not a decision or at least not for all.
Under pressure from competition both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State ' s share in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"With violence nothing can come out, and never can come out" -- Sting, "Lord song," where the main verse of the refrench is the words, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, they wouldn't have been," the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshell Rothchild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as usual, produced many responses.
Some advocate Israel, argumenting its position that it is entitled to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by arguing that with the racism of the Israeli State, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to think about who, in these recurring waves of killings, the perpetrator, and who, ultimately, the victims of today's Israeli citizens, including self-government, were born at the time of the current political situation and were not witnesses to the outbreak of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who is first of all served by the 95 years of tension (due from the signing of the Balfura Declaration in November 1917) on a small part of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are backed by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people are the main engineer of events in modern history.
The history of humankind is first and foremost a history of power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
That is not so clear whether these people have always taken their own steps, or behind their throne is someone who has guided their action towards the targets set before them.
It should be assumed that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that stems from them could not take place for one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be viewed as the head of the stroke (I don't know if someone's worth over them, but it's not excluded) - Rotchilds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) has bought them in the 1990s to stop rumors linking their name to criminal actions in the highest areas of the shadows of which they were, and which have always led to the strengthening of their power, the increasing of wealth, or both.
They have large stockpiles in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were only four countries, but at the same time the Russian Government had taken its central bank into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rotchildow Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own (see - governmental) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to release his own money and wanted to cancel FED (Federal Reserve System) and was killed in 1963. Deputat Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to bring FED to court for the triggering of the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their aspiration for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars established by the great masson of the 33rd Level of Albert Pyk.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially in Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion (this amount of slaves would be sufficient to provide their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families headed by Rotchilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of decisions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis that they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Gabsburg heir of Ferdinand, the Austria-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia, beginning the fervent revolution.
The first world war ended in a sudden, unfounded and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy the royal Russia) and consequently the dissolution of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the commencement of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a hidden conflict situation by imposing immense military reparations on Germany, rather than creating a prerequisite for the radicalization of the depleted masses, then have only been left to throw the Germans into a sufficiently strong, inspiring and proposing simple decisions of the Leader, to further establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and have indeed played a role in the fifth column, in the incitement of a warfire.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rotchildas provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfura Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had emerged from the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or what he had done was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany had been brought back by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel had been proclaimed to create a third war blade.
If international bankers were able to unleash it, the Jewish people, like the second world war, would be the victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only within the country but also at the international level (only a sharp division of people against the supporters and opposers of Israel).
Who is responsible, and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment in an endless chain of violence has begun with the greed and aspirations of individuals to world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers encourage people to vote in elections solely for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international politicians who do everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Pakistan, Pakistan) will threaten to break into the world conflict, and given Iran ' s control over the Aarmuz Strait, which contains 20 per cent of all the world ' s oil stocks (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockfeller in 1994: "Everything we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their submission is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocratics enjoying comfort.
A world where every organism born at birth implants a chip with which it becomes a person under total control.
"And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to have a climes on their right hand or on their forehead, so that a man who is not marked by the name of that beast or by the number of his name cannot sell.
That is the wisdom. Everyone who has understanding can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and it is the number of six hundred and sixty-six.

They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown chess of Mohammed Reza Pehlevi, who had fled after the U.S. revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not to be expected - she could not afford to throw a chess offboard because it could have undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not in a position.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failure to release hostages by force.
Detainees of diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian Government's mediation.
Their destiny has raised a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran attitudes at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, erected by Actor Ben Afflek, "Argo Operation" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America little victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy, six workers escaped.
After the complex peripetics, they finished their journey to the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in taking them out of Iran, with an extravagant legend of cover, whereby they went to Canada's passports as members of a survey group that searched a place for a survey of the science and fantastic era.
Genres Combination
The plan that the expert on evacuation, Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, the specialized journals had written about the film project, and press conferences were organized, and the derivative company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on Tony Mendes' memoirs.
Afflek's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, the so-called “film-kinoopus”, the story of a good idea, an affair, might be an example of a series of films about friends of Ouschen.
The film is constantly changing the moods, on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the titras show marking historical photographs of events and how the same situations have been demonstrated in the film -- no big difference).
On the other hand, the relief of the Hollywood passages crossing with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations, at the staircases of institutions, on the telephone...
Ben Afflech made a great career rehab.
The ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his game was no longer the object of ridicule.
Argo's third full film, after a dark detective, "Goodby, Baby, Farewell" (2007) and "The City" Triller (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Afflek film that is not filmed in the hometown of director Boston.
The atmosphere of the place, however, refers to qualities that raised the earlier films of the director over the Hollywood Standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are happening on the streets, when real events are reconstructed, the embassy's opening scenes are impressive, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when history suddenly changes.
The similar effect of Afflek and his colleagues is achieved in the scenes of fabulous (false headquarters on the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story did not imply a lot of exciting cinematographic scenes.
He's quite successful with this little thing, and sometimes he's thinking something about it -- it's not so elegant there. (the price in which the American phone call prevents the impending crisis at Tehran Airport, and the race on the airstrip looks pretty dull).
The lack of Argo is a lack of vagueness, which requires too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Afflek's film lacks a little dramatism, it's a film that can be seen with moderate interest, assessing the plot and regeneration of the seventieth trillers.
But it's hard to catch.
This is, however, enough for a reminder of one, still known, life history, as well as an exaggeration of the perceptions of all-mighty and all-knowing special services.
Air balloons, bananas and circus Rules
The portal of www.bankovniplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop”.
“The Us triggered the latest event in which the EU planned to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies”, stated the “Right” organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the already nominating absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court to combine the rates of insurance for men and women.
Women still had life insurance benefits because they were objectively less susceptible to insurance companies.
"The most incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013,” said Nager.
The EU disputed orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in harm to nature and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury degrees only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of a chicken cell, which caused eggs to travel significantly this year.
Also criticized was the actual prohibition of the use of the term “butterbродous oil” or the removal from the sale of classical lightbulbs.
Quality bananas shall be 14 centimeters long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are generally protected by a State or group of States (such as the Czech Republic now defends the demands of its banks under threat).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the banas of higher quality in the European Union should have reached 14 cm in length and did not have the courage to display “anomalous criterion”.
However, the European Commission was justified by the fact that it only harmonized the existing divergent national rules that complicated trade.
While resisting some States, the EU had mitigated the standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives would lead to the planting of products.
A candidate for winning in the survey may also be the EU ' s last year ' s decree that the sale of balloons must necessarily be warned that children under eight years of age cannot inflammate them without adult supervision.
The EU researched the United States that air balloons in games were a potential cause of death by suffocation.
This limitation now extends to children under the age of 14 who have been banned from wearing rubber rods.
Funny ideas are also born at home
A sufficiently absurd is the rule concerning European officials themselves: everyone who has a official position in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, given the delicateness of the topic for Greece, and should instead say “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal of Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, proposed to vote, in addition to several of the absurd rules mentioned above, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum food stocks that can be located in the Czech Republic on the day it enters the European Union.
Subsequently, Czechia exceeded, for example, the assigned amounts of conservative mushrooms, for which she was in danger of being fined.
The opponent was also interested in paying some countries for their lack of seas and in granting grants.
But those ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation”, stated in autumn 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas.
He argued that the country had a high crop of grains and that the so-called intervening procurement had provided the State with full stockpiles that had to be shipped.
For being far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for subsidy offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by the Minister Paul Nemtz (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to be made for the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Excellent orders are the exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, EU efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe that more should be recognized.
In the view of the experts, it is a serious problem to draw EU substantiation for projects that are not even implied by a common point of deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
Emotion is expressed among the Czechs and that, as in other European countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to identify its traditional products in a specific way, and it does not always win the competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name Olomoutsk raw materials, but the Thames Ram, whose traditions in our country were rooted in the 19th century, our producers had to be renamed "Tuszemak."
Only food from the reeds, not from the sugar can be called rum.
The European Union ' s official list of registered products, together with globally known “feta” and “horgondzela” raw cheese, a marcipan from the German Lubek or the Parma branch, has already been found, for example, Carlovary sugars, humiliated and treshbonian carp and gretz hmel.
Also, the EU may be proud of the granular sponge and the spice tube.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm a lover, says Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man get the head of a presidential ballot?
I don't think of being a senator or president myself.
If we'd had everything in our country without trouble, I wouldn't have run a ballot.
But I can't see over the past 20 years, the country has been screwed up by thieves, people are increasing taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to figure out how to change it.
And since I have been forty years old and I am an independent person who is not a party, I have no other opportunity to influence things other than to run for the Senator or President.
You went to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you thus turn back to the people you chose?
I've always said that I'll be involved in the struggle for the presidential castle, depending on the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified that if I were to be chosen by the senator, I would go to the presidents.
My goal is not to be a post, the post is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
I therefore need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we're as a nation cunning at our bar or TV, but they're willing to untwist anyone who's trying to change something.
This is added to the media, which negligent humans, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was a adviser to Irgy Paroubek.
Let's go to your eyes.
The struggle for the presidential castle has begun with theories of the physical and criminal responsibility of politicians and the reverse property declarations of more than twenty million.
To do so, it is necessary to amend the law.
You have no such authority as President, and only the whole Senate can offer laws.
How do you want to do that?
When I lobbyed as a citizen to make the tours a free entrepreneurship, I was able to move forward.
The problem is politicism, when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or right, it is deliberately impeded, and it deters citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have a much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I do not have party disposition on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you think you're more right or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people refer to me rather as a left-handed person.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little left or a little right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
It's not about someone being right, but someone on the left, I want to combine people.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it will offer HRM or GDP, and I will likewise be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove that by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or are spoken of by eminent experts.
But without parliamentary support, only slogans will remain.
And with that in politics you won't last long.
Or do you think that when you come out and talk to people, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
Just persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected President, there would be no problem in organizing a direct television broadcast in which I will turn to the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties, calling for the legalization of material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell them why they do not want to.
If there is a strong person who is exposed to abuse, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, which was a merit of public pressure.
I'm telling you that I'm a lover, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am only a politician, and for my programme, I will seek the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move on; if that is not possible, I'll be back to the private sector six years later.
It's kind of sounding like Ocamura has to save Czechia.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I've gone around a number of famous people proposing to run in the Senate.
I went to Rad Janchur, and he refused a lot of work.
I also supported at least the lead investigator, journalist Jan Lorentsov, who opened up fraud with light fuel products.
I've put out my candidacy because people are really unsatisfactory, but now I feel weighed.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and the majority of those who had chosen the plaintiffs.
We're only two independent in the Senate.
People chose the Senate to make changes difficult.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check out the purity of the past of every potential supporter, and I don't have any money for it.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what about your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a section in Prague worth about 25 million, a 10 million apartment, another 8 million apartment, a collection of artwork for about 10 million, Aston Martín for 3.5 million and the Superb School for a million, and a few million more on the account.
By the way, Aston-Martin came in, because it was my boy's dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving in the car, was a gallantine with women, and at the same time fought against mortgage and lawlessness.
You're going to Aston Martín, you have 60 million property and you don't have money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want your own money to invest in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the pre-election campaign from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover senatorial salaries.
But I wouldn't have lived for that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't have been running.
So, then, you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd reduce that activity?
But it doesn't depend on the wages.
As I promised, my activities have been partially reduced.
For example, my deputy will be the director of the tourist agency in the spring.
People would like to know that I was an insolvent person who would keep the republic.
But I have something to live on, too.
How much as an entrepreneur have you used to get monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, I'm still getting it.
And if I had become president, I would have finished my business.
A full interview you'll find on Saturday issue of the newspaper "Right".
MVRDV architects prove that these adventures are not only in the imagination - in the case of Spaykenis and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, and we're finally able to see something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, crossing the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist near a major enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everybody has Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Now no one volunteers to go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spikenisse, a small-minded bedroom town under Rotterdam, owns an unusual record.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fiction bridges, which are portrayed in the euro billboards, in the form of an artificially painted miniature from ironbethon.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Murterdam Architecture Bureau of MVRDV, the master of bold column charts, and the author of fascinating, sometimes even cynical buildings, reacted to his normal unwitting task and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and grinding on the face.
And while the jury looked down and pressed with their shoulders, the ugly Maas made a pyramid from his original gift of size and finished speaking in defense of his project with the words, "Honorable citizens!"
Here it is, my offer, "Prince Mountain" in Spikenis, so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, mail and several accommodations and taunhouses in total for 50 apartments.
In early November, “The Book Mountain” was awarded the second “The Greatest Library of the Netherlands 2012”.
The project also participates in the 2012 national Dutch wooden competition.
Thus, the faceless suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer anything but the postmodernist pedestrian zone and the remarkably facade, the white facades of which imply on the idea of a milk plant, became more rich in one modern artwork of the architecture.
But most importantly, in Spakenisse, the first public building in the history of this town was a cultural building.
A Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that the book Eldorado is under the cheese colt.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, for real architecture and reading will be preferred to explore the area on foot.
On all sides, a leafy and easily visible space, burned brick floors and elegant street lamps make a sense of public urban area unmistakably visible.
Urban environment regenerated perfectly.
The glance is inclined to look for benches, dogs, and soccer boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Sometimes the bookstores are standing along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, typically uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We set up a classic configuration of the space from the legs to the head and pulled the reading zone out of the inside.
The inner space of the book mountain has been used in a good manner: the center is housed with offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and technical facilities.
The black bookstools, which serve as a section of walls, parapets, or staircase pearls, are especially welcome.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tempted architects and builders are lost in guessing what this is for unknown material.
"We were trying to work with secondary materials," explains Yop Traubborst, the project leader of the Spaykenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once in one agrarian business in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in heat and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness has been used as a subset for roots.
It's cheap and saving time.
The fine textile serves one or two seasons and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this canvas, for the first time in such volumes, was compressed in a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Lendbauplastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, solid material, a slightly resembling a new car and a little crossing.
They're taking 105 degrees to the top.
Those who travel about 500 meters [500 m] will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view on the city but also with Dutch croquets and wood fibers in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, especially the right humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Expenses for a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is an exemplary environmental project," says Trouborst.
Its heating and cooling uses the earth’s warmth.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass flame, even in clear days, the sun falls inside just for a little while.
Large farms from glued wood situated perpendicularly to glazing facade give a shadow and take most of the sun’s beams.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection is fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has already been here.
And a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "Spacenisse's soul a long-standing need."
The reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were to take empty places on the shelves of the entire library, which at that time had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are upstairs.
"There's nothing worse than half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection with this new home.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in fulfilling the royal task, which is called the creation of identity in a professional jargon.
Spakenisse wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point to build identity.
Sbo: “Numbers must play a more important role”
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, by doing so, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support it.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical to Israel.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the voting on the establishment of a banned flight zone.
As a result, NATO made this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from the policy that the United States, in effect, governed to its own foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is compounded by the lack of a harmonized single policy among the Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they start their role, they are on the way to "normal" foreign policies.
The foreign policy of France or Britain.
What, then, does the “normal” foreign policy specifically mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a national position, independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and linkages with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests were largely different from those of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and voted in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large marketing markets in the Middle East, in particular in the States of the Gulf of Persia.
It must therefore be cautious in order not to insult the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much, it's not a completely unilateral link.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I'm sure in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of German position prevails.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
This is a signal that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be considered in its interest.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the veto was clearly expressed.
Is there a divergence between the United States and many European States?
Because of American domestic policies, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation, of course, the Government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant divergence of views is not as significant as it always appears.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you'll notice that Obama is not very pleased with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important EU partner?
I think that makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be slightly easier for the Germans if there were a single, uninterrupted European policy, but that was not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and have to act instead on the basis of their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is difficult for Germany to do so, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This subject has always been fragile.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany’s leading role still hard to play?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, and it is still unpleasant for obvious reasons, and it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis, every time Germany takes an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans don't just handle it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, and this is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European policy is steadily diminishing, but at this time the EU does not fill that vacuum, who remains?
The Germans just have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it hurts or increases your disloyalty to you, it's life!

"Safety of Goodmarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-wide trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with firms whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the original title owners submit a claim.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"The foreigners are getting more difficult to defend their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in the violation of trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk every week, there's a new business like that.
Individuals need to add only a couple of letters to obtain the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci gets Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In this same way, German enterprises, such as the Puma sports producer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the trademark registration department in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chinese are world champions for copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
There are multi-story subdivisions in large cities that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, the case of Pattloch is not the case, and, by instructions from his trustees, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises are fully officially given to the trademark registration agency the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it a bank of minpai, a passenger stamp.
The word is associated with the ban of dakuan.
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilt
"This is detrimental to the business, and it must be fought," I believe Pattloch.
"The trademark is blurring, the unique position is lost, the image is very suffering."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to a CLSA market research company, China, with a sale of 15 billion euros per year, is the third in size and the fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, the removal of doubtful records in the trademark registry is difficult and costly.
The process may last up to nine years, with unclear outcomes.
Pattloch describes cases in which the court rejected claims because after a long period of time, the challenged name was “the reality of the market”.
If the plaintiff is unhappy, he'll even have to pay the plastic because he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the jungle law rules here.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a judicial dispute with the construction manufacturer, Sany, a company that had recently acquired a concreteosos company of Putzmeister.
Thus, Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to a Mercedes star.
The company that bought Volvo, Geely, originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion producer lost in China simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who had a famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Mark Registration Statement in Beijing confirms that the shortage of staff and equipment there had been difficulties in 2010.
But last year, there was a "return from an emergency in the work process to the norm".
For example, the number of outstanding objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent larger than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still awaiting production in the department.
Fighting It Is Precious
As often as China is, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark security applications, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has headed a list of new registrations worldwide ten times in a row, reports the department.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan fees were paid.
If simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
It's worth many times more than the case of Freudenberg's German family.
For more than seven years, the conception has been fighting against the Chinese plaguer.
The Germans have succeeded in eliminating the illicit production of fake road parts.
However, the simulator secured Chinese trademark rights for Freudenberg.
This was an omission because the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark registration agency also rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won both of the following, but the enemy continues to fight.
We need to be alert.
The matter is under consideration by the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerve."
Internal costs were hardly accountable, and the firm's archive had to review even centuries of age in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite side a "big six-digit euro" for a settlement.
"It's all clear how expensive it is to us," says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East are threatened to be overthrown even into Europe.
It is where simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
Concerne had long ceased production in these areas, but it had been possible to prevent registration.
"We need to be alert," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, rather for aliens to “all that is worth protecting, also register in China”, says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it might be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of its trademark drama, it will have to pay the licensing fees for its own name to the contrary, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise we'll be stripped of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi is rehearsed by AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
The history of relationships that reached over 8,733 kilometres.
Initially, the flooding of cowboy boots, basketball crossings, ladies' boats, and male tappings are picking up a tact on the fence floor and quickly finding it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of the singers, the alt, the bas, the tenor, and the soprano, come, fascinate, and follow each other.
And Phile Hopf, a 29-year-old driver, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and clear gestures.
The evening of Monday, at the Medical Psychology Institute in Heidelberg, the choir of Imbongi is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age attended the rehearsal, from a human genetic specialist to a palace.
Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every choir's voice has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulus, which speaks eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
According to estimates by Unids, United Nations AIDS programmes, there are about 34 million HIV infections worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzheni, the Voices for Africa has found chiefs in Germany.
Of them, 70 are attending a school preparing for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the boss.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch in Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulus means a storyteller or a praiser.
They don't say running to the banta in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir is learning songs in that soft language, and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared — south Africa.
The village of Esitzheni, which depends on German choir voices, is an area of 8733 kilometres from Haidelberg, north-west of the kingdom of Swaziland.
Infected 40 per cent
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw cabins, among many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died of the HF virus.
In Esitzeni, the miniature reflects Swaziland's disease: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy of UNICEF.
The circumcision of the extreme flesh in men, which provenly reduces the risk of half of contamination, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the Swaziland population suffers from immunodeficiency virus, and deaths are not rare at the middle of the fourth tenth.
Hor opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the Imbonics saw many children on the streets, not only with parental care, but just with food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, there is no chance for a person in a poor country.
At first, it was a private commitment by individual participants, in a few euros per year, to send a child to school and to allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the chorus set up a group of voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitzheni.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamidios and tripper (honorea) are attributed to bacterial ICPs.
Often virus-influents are HIV, human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Lobby pedicules and spices are related to parasitic ICPs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mostly from men who have sex with men.
Robert Kocha's Institute is based on the fact that in at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often suffer from sexually transmitted diseases include chlamidian infections, trichomoniasis, candydosis (greek), gonorrhea and human papiloma-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamidian infections are significantly higher than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections are affected by young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papilloma virus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
The syphilis disease, according to Robert Koch Institute, has doubled more than 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
New HIV infections have declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may cause genital mutilation, urination complaints, leakage, stomach pain, and bubbles or chopsticks.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contamination but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially when sexual partners change frequently.
In early diagnosis, most of the ICPs can be cured and remote effects can be avoided.
Chefism, donations, and not the last fee for choir presentations throughout Germany, allow for something to be gathered.
"We've all sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzheny," says Annete Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of Germany, Two Dlamini, a deliberate and active woman, is disposed of by money.
She also cares for orphans to be well - arranged, such as in one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in the Zulus of old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them have accepted up to 14 orphans, have given them a roof over their heads, and have children in uniform every day appear in a timely manner.
Those who do not have their relatives go to Hanysil's shelter, a single woman who receives the wages of the association, as well as two cooks that prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the “Voices for Africa” unit organized a sewing school, built two chickens, and jointly with the American Health Organization PSI organized HIV analysis for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's linked to sexuality."
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in Africa, King Maswati III, is known for his love of surplus.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-authorized lifestyle is also blamed for spreading the HF virus so rapidly in past years.
But it also lies with brooding workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annethe Lennartz, "but they are almost unused.
Another culture is flesh to the flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, chorus Ibmogni travels south of Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, a war spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness that many in the southern part of the black continent have known since apartheid.
The bus, full of whites, who sing black songs, does not only bring good moods and joys but even tears in the eyes of severe border guards.
The trip also leads to Esitzheni, where singers visit the children of the whisper.
Although a small village is hard to find on the map, it is more than known in the Ezulveni Valley.
"Go to Esitzheny, there's light," say the people here.
And after a flight of 8733 kilometres back to Heidelberg, when the dripping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
NASA opens ice in Mercury.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that Mercury had ice on the planet.
The Ice Cover may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. Space Department of NASA has proved that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is nearest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in a special journal in Science.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that the constant shadow of the world's region was covered with ice.
Its thickness must be at least 30 centimeters, perhaps up to 20 meters.
Possibly, water occurs from a comet or perhaps an asteroid encountered by Mercury.
No one links the discovery of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader Zon Solomon.
Mercury may reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help to explain how water and other construction elements of life had fallen to other places of the solar system.
Unrecognized for Earth's inhabitants, telescopes and small robots, such as Fenix, are looking at the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: little eyes in endless gifts.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Karlic Planet of Cererera.
Like Pluton, who is approaching the sun for Neptune, the Church, by the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a “planet”.
This fragment of the infrared Spitzer telescope represents the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in blue points, the harder to identify in the star circle, the pink "newborn" stars.
This zoom region, scientists unromanticly call it W5, is an open Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Kassiopea, 6500 light-years.
This overflowing heat of a dying star photographed the NASA Spitzer telescope.

It is located 700 light-years in the constellation of Vodoleya.
The coincidence with the Earth's continent brought this nebula called North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photos provides an exemplary colour transfer.
This new star in all beauty was photographed only by infrared sensors from Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his ring: How did they come about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably a slice of Saturn's moon, which has disappeared infinitely 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear images of the Habble telescope: the Water Craft galaxy
Depending on the color of the photographs, spiral galaxies are transformed into actual artwork.
The photo published by the European South Observatory shows a few thousand-year light-year nebula of Triphid in the Star of the Shoot.
The name Triphid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-drawn, three-dimensional), as the dark dust is divided into three parts of the winged heart of the stars.
In the constellation of the Zmeenos, astronomers photographed a cosmic collision forerunner: at the distance of 400 million light years from the Earth, the nucleus of the two blending galaxies will meet each other and will inevitably be confronted.
This star birth, Habble telescope, took off in the spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who does not like the technical reductions may call it by name "The South Cole".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows the fragment of Iris's Nebula in the Zephei Constellation.
Nebula removed by 1,400 light-years consists of particles of dust, which are between 10 and a hundred times smaller than the normal domestic dust.
This image was drawn from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows the ring of black holes away from the Earth for 430 million light years.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed for NASA the Space Telescope Habble.
The big spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This star nebula has the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle constantly creates new stars.
It's a star cloud connected to the Rosette Nebula, and it's constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
This brightly luminous galaxy with a little black hole has not yet had dust, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it emerged shortly before the Big Bang, when most of the universe had hydrogen.
Our Views in the Universe: Critical Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey, even before Galileo Galileo began to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, represented here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each diameter 8.4 meters.
“Telescopeio Canarias” has a giant inner device, one mirror only 10.4 metres diameter.
The Greater South African Telescope mirror in South Africa is segregated to reduce value.
However, it is about 11 metres in diameter.
Lack of inexpensive constructive performance: The telescope is rigidly stabilized under a vertical angle, which limits its motion.
The Hobbie Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity: High light-driven ability.
It reaches -- despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror -- the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Arizona, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extra-terrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
Participating in the Outer Mind Look (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing its computational power.
A view to the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
It's a "Very big telescope" that's exactly what it's called.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual pipe.
In Chile's ESO Observatory, it is also planned to install a European Big Telescope Sense.
Its main mirror should be thrust into a whole of 42 meters, and it will be composed of almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should not be expected before 2018.
By 2007 both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors of ten metres diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which also sees the sky with Subara and IRTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a diameter mirror of 30 meters must appear on Mauna Kea.
Here they can look at the illustrations.
The most important species from space, however, are the Habble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided pictures of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system, especially those on which life is possible.
On 2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope have been printed in the photographs.
James Webb's Space Telescope (JWST) will be shipped to space no earlier than 2018 on the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that Mercury is on the southern pole.
However, no reliable data is available because Messenger is moving closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radary measures for decades have pointed out that Mercury has had ice.
Thanks to the Massenger Zonda launched in 2004, the first one that rotates around Mercury, the scientists are now sure.
Eat butter every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblical age of respect.

Looking for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem even more young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblical age of respect.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Looking for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem even more young.
The trip through the Talish mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The Microautobus creeps on the gulfy road past the dense hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant homes.
Everything is so green and bright that you think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southest end of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometres away.
There are tales, one of the people of the Caucasus, which is not known for much, except that they speak beautifully to Farsi and Azerbaijani and are long years old.
The end point is Lerik.
A small town is throwing itself into a too heavy Soviet architecture that is not in harmony with the beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe don't almost come here, the road from the Baku capital of Azerbaijan is too tireless.
Eight hours pass by 323 kilometres because the road has only one strip.
The legendary wealth that the country owes to the petroleum of the Caspian Sea is here until it reaches the province.
However, Pilate Fatulaev (48) is convinced that there is nothing to interest visitors in Lerika.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by the Evrovides song festival, and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayawa.
She's the director of the long-term museum, probably the only one in the world.
There is a documented biography of about eight dozen tales of these places over 100 years of age, and Fatulayava points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
He had another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the Chirala Muslumov, allegedly 168 years old.
No birth certificate, however.
In view of the fact that the oldest person whose age has been confirmed by the documents was 122, the age of Musluman is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayawa.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at the age of 136, he had a daughter.
So did the Muslums chat add a couple of decades to its age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher from Max Plank Institute in Rostock, heard of long-term residents in Mid-Asia.
“Oftenly many elderly people can also be found in some parts of China, in Japan, or in Hunz Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “in Sardinia, too, there are very many very old people.”
However, the absence of documents makes it impossible to establish scientific evidence of age because there were no civil registries.
Every day a glass of deplete oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the area of Lerik are very often astonishing to reach Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long-lasting here in the south?
Azerbaijan's guide, Farid Muhimzade, explains this with special tales genes.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the other hand, believes that it's about food.
Talks like meat, bread, and most of the breastfeeding, many drink every day from a cup of deplete oil, but it is unlikely that high - colored diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it in the life of the world that preserves youth, and in the small village near the city of Lerik, Ruba Mirsoev, the city of Chengemirna, the town of the town of Lerik.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter, which she's riding all over.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughters of Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two youngsters are also jumping nearby.
In the kitchen, the guests are cooking teas that are given in typical purple glasses of anrmudus.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, and under her head tip she hides the long dark-Russian coats that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell and kept the color.
"And I've never used a champagne," says Mirsaev.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought any food in the store all my life.
She then tells of her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it's better when Gaydar Aliev's "love father" got at the helmet.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in the old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the father of the nation, which ruled the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan is practically unaware of the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani old men.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, and for local conditions it is an amount that can live well.
And perhaps the oldest son of Mirzaeva is also right, "Starics in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happiness.
The No Reason to Live as Long as Possible
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show a deep division in the country.
The future constitution, based on the shariatah, faced a violent resentment.
The Egyptian President did not stumble to paphos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success lies on my responsibility to the people and to the god," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but primarily to Christian cops, liberals, educated Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, who are still hopelessly separated from the frustrated opposition, are fearful.
Fear of the religious State in the Neil for the mercy of the powerful "Bratev Muslim".
Mohammed Murcy, apologizing almost, said that he had temporarily cut the constitutional court's jurisdiction and expanded his competence to "saving the revolution."
But what really wants to save 61-year-old engineer, who has a degree of doctorate at the University of South California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles have been delivered in a 15-hour night jump, with obstacles to an Islamist Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings are based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do "principes" mean?
This was and remains the case of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists would use vague language and the resulting legal loft for a more rigorous interpretation of sharia.
At least one new article suggests that all Sharia cases should be brought to the Council of the University of Al-Ashar, the country ' s most important Islamic institution, with great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy supervise legislation that de facto would have resulted in the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution, many things are the subject of interpretation
Another problem: the defendants must continue to be tried by the military court.
These courts during the Mubarak authorities served to repress opposition agents.
After the dictator was overturned, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military detention.
The project also stated that the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “the morality and values of the Egyptian family”.
This is so unclear legally formulated that government agencies can even control the content of movies and literature by means of this article.
This means nothing other than censorship.
In general, no article establishes direct equality between men and women.
But another forbids the prophet Muhammad and his messengers to be offended and defrauded.
But what this insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the wording for “humbleness of people” is prohibited.
Will the president's cartoon be enough or a joke about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this draft, which Murcy proposed for signature and, he said, “as soon as” would be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"Revolution's back."
For several weeks, the opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been molded.
Tens of thousands of people gathered together in an unusual unanimity Friday night at the Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and the former leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, stated that the draft constitution was “in the landfill of history”.
Through a short Twitter news service, he accused Murcia's adherents of wishing to lead a “poult against democracy”.
"If he declares a referendum, we'll go to his palace and throw him down," said Opposer Jasser Said.
"We're not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not vengeful," quotes the Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"Coran is our constitution."
The well-organized “Bratya Musulmane”, in turn, called for a contrasting demonstration, but out of precautions, not in the Tahrir area, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile to the University of Cairo.
A large number of women under covers and salaphites were involved, who shouted: “People require the application of God’s law”.
They asked Murcia to cleanse the country, and they said, "Coran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area at which it all started has led to a state of virtually civil war.
Mursie’s followers evidently refused to go on that risk.
The Bartya Muslims stated that both the opponents and the supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
It is now time for the people to decide at the scrutiny of the country's direction.
Most of the Islamist project is considered a decision.
"The notion of "human rights" is not mentioned at all."
Hafiz Abu Saed is angry with this intensified constitutional process, which was to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EPR) defended the Bartev Musulman when they were in prison or tried at Mubaraka.
Not because he divided their minds, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never appear in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The increased influence of Murcia on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing the lawyer.
These measures constitute explicit blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In place of strengthening the civil State, the President de facto canceled it,” regrets Saed.
Democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the Neil with a mixture of curiosity and tensions.
For this, it may be a payment.
The demonstrat on the Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian shellfish: the stupidest scenting fish in the world?
The five million Norwegian population has one of the highest standards of life not only in Europe but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the secret of the country's success is somehow linked to local addictions to one extremely zoo fishing dish?
Take some reconnaissance cheese pieces.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweat sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to have a smashing smell of cocktail, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but it smells indebted in the air.
Raffinsk is a trout that is salted and dived in the water up to the year, depending on what kind of shower is to be achieved.
As the twilight cools and cools down, the Norwegian crowds gather at a festival in Fagernes, which is dedicated to the same thing, say, a fascinating dish.
"They eat cheese and drink aquavit aquavit, a local tuna vodka," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local fireman on the profession and a joint “raffic General”, who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat a small - cut fish and drink it with a lot of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit more than a carcass," says Haward.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece under your nose, it's not that bad, it's very little different from the portion of the land you've been carrying on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from very different times, in times of poverty, when, before refrigerators emerged in autumn, fish were nitrogenized in hermetically closed barrels with salt water.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish were already well and thoroughly polluted, they were extracted from it and, having numbed the perception of alcohol, were used in food.
Even in the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, more than 13 per cent of immigrants who are employed here, high wages and developed social security.
Sweden’s residents (a long-standing rival and a much more prosperous neighbor) come to work here.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an unprecedented, at least a slightly maligned element of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local foods.
On the other hand, a little beer cup or sandwich will cost you £9 (US$14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most people in the country seem to do so.
People here still reluctantly mention the name of Anders Bravik, the racist and extremist of the right-wing, who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorists are referred to as “witnessed on 22 July”.
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens was able to commit such atrocities and murders.
Norway's current well-being is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventieths) as one of the largest oil-gas industries in the world.
"Only oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, whose pots are worn out with relied cancer, a woman with long bright hair and amazingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are a people, as you call it, a wise one.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks beautifully English.
We don't like showing up, we're not boasting.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of the oil-gas revenues are invested in a special fund established for the benefit of future generations.
In the years that preceded the world financial crisis, when everyone had eradicated the money they had not had, Norway was careful to calculate all the costs.
"After you can roll on winter skis and walk on summer trips, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a carcass," she adds with a rubbish laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some meal, I'm done.
Here's a hamburger with bucket meat that's definitely an exotic, delicious juice meat.
But tonight, we'll get even more of the same fish that smells unforgettable.
At my hotel, a special dinner on the scrapfish is held, during which the audiences voted to determine the best or perhaps the most fragile fish.
It's a straight-up television showing a tie leader around a plate with a carcass.
It's like a song competition called "Euroviction."
"So, Torr-Yurgen, what's your estimate for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, this is our assessment."...
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe taking aquavit.
Or maybe just breathing the smell of this fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nieto, is facing a difficult start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nieto, is preparing to take office, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his people.
The road in Mexico City is in a particularly deplorable state.
The city was overloaded by transportation and at a better time, and the steel barriers were lifted from Monday, cutting several key roadways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
This was not done, however, to prevent people from getting to work in suburban areas but to prevent protesters from joining the Parliamentary Building.
The new head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, will be presidential and will take over the country.
He's got a challenge.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance in the administration of Felippe Calderon, which is now in power, but the country has been in war with drugs, which has lost some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government declares to the people of Mexico its willingness to fight violence”, Mr. Penja Nieto, earlier this week, told President Barak Obama of the United States in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Penja Nieto, President of the United States, had developed a political career as governor of his home state, Mexico City.
His homeland, in a densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital, shared views on the new leader.
A rectangular person
In the idile town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
The residents deserve the revitalization of tourism, the development of the курort and the creation of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Penja Nieto, which differs in a variety of ways with beatings and pits previously in this area, can be reached to the city.
The tablets with his name hang on a modern sports centre building and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We link our hopes with him for real and serious changes,” says his friend and political alliances, Gabriel Olver Hernández, State Congressman from the headed Penya Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous residency, the PRI party was pushed out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace, the party holds great hopes for Enrique Penja Nieto.
In addition, he refuted the allegations of insecurity that had been put forward to the new President of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to embodiing his vision of the country's future.
It's a great public figure, and above all, a person who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The Municipality of Nesaualcoatl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most remarkable contrast with the wet streets of Valé de Bravo.
Hidden under the highway estacades, it is in many ways the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops had been brought to restrain drug gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly acute here.
In the desert, only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of killed women have been discovered near the extensive landfill.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Penya Nieto, which is significantly higher than that in the sadly-prevalent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become critical when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Penya Nieto, he was better off to say that he had not been able to deal with the problem of the killing of women during his stay as governor.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of totally ignoring the problem.
Irenea Buencia, a resident of a concrete house that looks like most of the houses in this vicinity, hardly stops tears by showing me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of Mariana in 2010, she committed suicide.
However, her family believes that her cohabitant killed her.
"When I got to her house, it was like her body was washed before," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs of her being beaten, and her body was cut off.
Mariana's mother tells us this story, and the picture of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, where there's only one word on: justice.
That is what they said was rejected by that family.
"The state's longing faces treated me as an old gossip, an unpleasant disturber of tranquillity.
They want people to accept everything they say, and they don't.
But that's not right, but it's not possible, especially when there's so much breaches and shortcomings around," she says.
After wearing a presidential band on Saturday, President Penya Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
During the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have dealt with violence-related crimes, and the new President has promised to make the problem a priority during his Government.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olver, a congressman from the Valle de Bravo party.
This, however, is what the victims' families most fear.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about the ill-treatment, accusation.
The prosecutors are attempting to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the closure of the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning ' s detention were cruel.
The U.S. ряд army is accused of abducting several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that a series of Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leakage of classified materials in the history of the United States, did not use many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had to endure while in a military prison.
During the cross-examination of the pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the weekly visits to Manning by the prison administration during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examination in the context of the application for the termination of the Manning case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and self-sufficient, was carried out the following day after Manning had stated that he had been detained and had intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analysis specialist arrested in June 2010 was accused of abducting several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks' resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the Attorney of Fein, along with Manning, reviewed reports that were filled after visits by Manning by the Administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention regimes from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When the Attorney of Fane asked for the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment of himself by the prison administration as “priority” and the general conditions of the prison as “all professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his content, Fane argues.
Manning replied that he expressed oral concern about these problems and that the authorities visiting him had discussed these problems with him and had stated that they would be handled but did not put that in writing.
"They wrote down "they don't have any attempts" (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean that I didn't raise this subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denis Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his ill-treatment in January 2011 at a meeting of the commission that considered the Suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he was removed from the regime of “traumatism prevention” and mitigated the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that a limited regime of detention, at a lower level than a suicide control regime, had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to ensure the safety of others.
"I wanted to let the administration know that I'm all right for them to reverse the trauma prevention regime... so that my life standards can improve from my point of view," explained Manning.
On Thursday Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was imprisoned at the Navy base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait and that he had lost his consciousness once because of heavy heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult for you to know how your destiny is resolved and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world was pityd for Camp Arizhan's base, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
He said that while he was in Quantico, Manning spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day -- alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only the mattress, the blanket, the shavings, several clothes and glasses.
He says he's trying to move because he's sleeping or even just lying down in the daytime.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light that penetrated outside the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned in the bed at night, he said he was buzzed and forced to turn around on his back.
Lawyer Manning formally objected to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that, after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners on the morning screen.
Manning stated that he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the check.
Responding to the questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the order of the guard that he had to throw a blanket to which he could cover himself, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempts to show the officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a coward's rubber or slap to traumatize himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, slappers and glasses were taken out of the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had experienced during the detention and would significantly reduce the length of his detention if Manning was found guilty by a military court to start his case at the beginning of the following year.
The defence stated that it was up to Manning to accept guilt for less serious crimes and that other accusations were contested as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for these weekends, and it is expected that the prosecution party will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with the strictest possible regime.
Among the charges put forward by Manning are the aid of the opponents, the illicit promotion of the dissemination of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national defence and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may be subjected to life imprisonment.
My crisis in national self-determination is the story of the American of Mexican descent.
In the author ' s view, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin break between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico City, I went through the parish hall, approached the border control zone and sat on the ground.
The marks indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexico), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood before them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York think they're Italian.
Later, I came to think of the complex design of the Mexican American.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's home, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language bearers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nieto, visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was used for meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penya Nieto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico, with the same success, instead of moving to the United States.
He would like to conclude a partnership treaty with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc similar to the European Union.
In addition, President Penja Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and insulting issue.
Most Americans had never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to renounce half of their territory under a rifle.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not for minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for a U.S. state department to speak at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, the press and the elites of Mexican society to complain that the Americans are infringing on the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with militia.
Mexico's relationship with over 35 million Mexicans living in the United States is most complex.
Would you like to talk about insults?
They're enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in that country and those who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent were not able to realize themselves in Mexico at some point in their family history and were forced to go north.
Often they were Mexicans of a certain type, striped, uneducated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico it's different.
Today, our lives are the embodiment of the American dream, we were learning in good schools and working well, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them in the same way.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as a second class, as non-performing Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors were successful in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain now, finding a well-fed life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and was legally relocated to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are some frictions between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin -- Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and the Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to the Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstin.
Getting the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found during my visit, as if our relationship was already not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to rebuild their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Ambassadors of Mexico and to represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen relations with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work out.
Too much offense in the past.
In view of the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
Excuse me, but take care of this yourself, Amygos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States the way they dealt with Mexico one and a half centuries ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still in resentment for the very recent circulation of their relatives in Mexico.
Yeah.
Maybe we're more common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas faction could be a fragile foundation for a further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are common, futile disputes about who started; numerous buildings turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians killed, most of whom were civilians; and six Israelis, for the first time in the conflict, missiles released from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless link between the Israelis and the Palestinians in their long-standing conflict, there have been changes in the Middle East.
This can be seen in different ways, but the events of the “Arab spring” sparked a host of realities in the rebellious storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis were not able to stay away from the windstorm that shook the region.
As a result, their fight may become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope to get out of this deadly impasse.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation did not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire signed on 21 November will be implemented, the clashes that took place this week have only reinforced the positions of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement of Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will declare that they have forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some of the group leaders were destroyed and 1.7 million people were blocked in one of the most populated and troubled parts of the world, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas has increased its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well conclude that time works for them.
As the influence of the Islamic movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
The resurgenced regional leader of Turkey, once the closest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Gulf of the Persian Gulf.
Coming supporters of Hamas claim to establish an Islamic semi-month around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, which governs the Hizbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, where the more pro-Islamic rebels are about to overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and then to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas' allies.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region took place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Muslim Brothers was strengthened by President Mohammed Murcia.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas ' s support.
Muslim brothers, on the contrary, are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice could not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the “strong” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military sense, Hamas was overthrown.
The Israeli Anti-Ball Missile System of the Iron Dome justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas-started missiles.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for a while.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unwavering position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by missiles released from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly by the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such acts in international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud, in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January, joined with even more aggressive conservative conservatives under the leadership of Avigdore Libermann, is very convenient.
What is the point of condoning and giving the Palestinians their own State?
If they give them all power in the West Bank, will they launch rockets to Israel, as their gatherings in the Gaza Strip do?
Better keep them behind the wall and rigidly suppress any attempt to lift your head.
Perhaps the supporters of the “strong” line will win; however, their calculations may be dismissed in the Arabic spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries are not most intimately concerned with Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence portion of Israel's budget is more than that of all its Arab neighbours together.
The commencement of war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments strengthen their own economy.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Murcia, who worked with Barak Obama to cease the fire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to no lesser extent, take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
With democratic changes in the Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinians of the right to self-determination constitutes a bomb of slow action, which will explode sooner or later in Israel's occupied territories, like a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already undermined the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension of the growth of the Arab population only exacerbates those problems.
For the bloodshed that is carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas' movements, the international community has to pay its growing frustration.
Both sides need external impulse
The only solution remains that sound representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are the establishment of two States and the concession by Israel of the Territories in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too powerful in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which had a long time to decide to overturn arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, had, more than ever, a positive position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State that had been adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatch movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian State than the forthcoming ballot at the United Nations, which could result in the recognition of Palestinian virtual statehood.
President Obama must also play his role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During its first term, it has never submitted its own peace settlement plan.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the reluctance to engage in the solution to the problem.
This is a catastrophicly invisible position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Unified Packing Act entered into force.
The warnings on the harm to smoking and image of disease-affected parts of the body are contrasted to the depressed green boxes that are the same for all cigarette marks.
The first Australian law on one-type packing of cigarettes and tobacco products has entered into force by replacing logo and coloring of different marks with the same box of deficiency and olive color, with grim images of diseased parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking by their parents.
In addition to the different pictures and labels that warn of the harm to smoking, the only difference between the packages, which is mandatory on this Saturday, is the names of stamps that are printed in the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for packing tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the aim of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion.
This was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking under 26 years of age, 99 out of 100 never become smokers.
“Evidently, even at the very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to deliver through packing,” explains the Minister of Health Tania Plibersk, referring to studies that show that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of the princesss.
Australia was one of the least smokers in the world, so that those changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries had already considered the possibility of taking such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the enactment of the law.
tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those thought by its initiators,” says Scott McKintyir, a representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Forged producers from China and Indonesia will provide much more such products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha, of a small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portsigars and silicons that conceal unpleasant pictures in the package has rapidly increased (pactically from scratch) since two months ago, British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan have tried to appeal the case in the high court of Australia.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented some six thousand products to wholesale businesses and is awaiting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the view of experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal cigarette television advertising and support sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites from posting advertising on the network, but it cannot restrict foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco products and you only have this little loophole, the idea of moving your goods on the Internet will seem extremely attractive to you," explains Becky Freeman, following public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Friman notes the increase in the number of claims for trademarks written from the person of allegedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the business of a certain citizen who loves Marlboro's cigarettes so much that he hasn't regretted the power and time and made the video, or is the advertising company behind it?
The Australian Office of the British American Tobacco asserts that industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States have filed claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unjustly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations of all those countries with Australia are very small.
WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersec, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs to warn of the harm to smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is addressed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratingly disobeying innovations.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hayg, buying cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, leader of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the middle of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it more difficult to set up the goods by the shelf.
"Now I had an hour to unload my new party, and now four hours," he complains.
"Government has to be taken and completely forbidding cigarettes, we'd say, well, all right, we're done, we're closing the store," he says, putting his hands up.
It's not that bad to gambling in the world of electronic networks and constant connections.
On this Thanksgiving Day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day in the airport waiting for the flight is really boring, and there's no much help for books, magazines, iPhone, or even duty-free trade stores.
Recently, however, more scientists and professionals in child development have expressed their support for the wheeze.
They say that in certain situations it is not bad for us and our children to miss.
This forces the brain to divert itself from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we are all constantly in front of any screen, the advantages of boredom pass by us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll be back to that.
I used to think, like many others, that the boredom was a relatively recent invention when people had more free time.
That is not true, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary of Canada, author of the book The Intriguing History of Cookie (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boredom can be a very ancient story," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii, Latin beetles of the first - century borehole were found.
The question of how we understand the boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Escud, Professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the boredom has often changed.
After studying research materials on this subject and questioning a target group of 100, Professor Eistood and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boothing is when people “will but cannot do what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that the boring person doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything in my apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is “a disturbance of attention and the resulting deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is going on slowly.”
It may seem like a very similar depression, as it relates to the boredom.
However, Professor Eistood argues that despite the possible linkages between these conditions, boring people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study “Indeeds: Determination of Booths in terms of attention”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eistood and his colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, whose participants listened to the record of the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the television program included in the neighboring room, others heard those same sounds on low volume, so that they could hardly be selected, and the third group only listened to the recording of the voice without a foreign sound track.
Those people who heard a low volume TV observed that they were boring, more often than others -- they were hard to concentrate, but they didn't know the reasons for it and attributed it to boredom.
When we are trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, discontinuing attention may cause a boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neuroscience at the University of Gwelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "e.g., looking into the stream of articles on a conveyer in search of marriage, the distracting music can help to avoid boredom."
It's thought to continue that when people start rolling on a chair or drawing a carcule on a paper sheet, they do it from the bore, but now we know that it's really just helping to keep up physically.
“The study showed that children who do not have to erse and rotate learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly”, says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all face a bore when we delay the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, looking at an uninteresting film.
However, different people show a different degree of wheeze.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “fragile system” to measure such individual characteristics.
To measure this scale, questions and allegations are used, for example, “Much of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonally,” or “I am too much interested, so I don't have enough time to do.”
With the help of such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys miss more girls, says Stephen Vodánović, a professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially with a variety of external irritators.
In general, however, adolescents often miss them.
In 1991, Rid Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he associated himself with a pager with almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
The results were as follows: 32 per cent of adolescents said they were bored at school and during their homework, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
At the same time, only 3 percent of parents noticed that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what kind of boiling data would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescents have a peak of boredom”, mostly because children and adolescents are not able to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question, is it boring?
Sometimes it is not because, in extreme manifestations, research shows that it can lead people to absurd and dangerous physical activity, risky gambling, or some substance abuse in trying to get rid of the boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodánović, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else; that's a boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But this brain itself doesn't always know exactly what it's best to do.
If you're bored and you're going to put that energy on a guitar game or a cooking experience, you're going to do better for yourself.
But if you watch TV, you'll only get better for a while, and it'll pass soon.
So if your child misses and you give him iPad, he won't miss him, but he won't learn to fight the boredom by himself or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fence.
“And these self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he claims.
Your child learns not only to be self-employed; he also learns how to control himself at all.
I don't think the boredom needs to be exalted.
But it's not worth it either.
It is better to learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Yyceud agrees with that.
"We see it so that we need to be trembling more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unsatisfactory desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to break free from constant anxiety and just relax.
"In today's world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses, he says, and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
To date, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in Colorado.
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football player and a college student in the south-eastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be fully legal throughout the state: holding a small portion of the marijuana and the tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that he and his friends had been in Lamara in September and had been riding in a car near the Kansas border when the police had stopped them.
After a police officer found him in a marijuana car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for the possession of drugs and the possession of drugs - minor offences for each of which a $100 fine was due and a date for the trial.
"We're treated as criminals," said Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which lasted several weeks after the state of Colorado voted for legalizing the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of minor cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of review.
The charges of minor marijuana-related offences have already been removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already ceased to charge people at the age of 21 and above for holding small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as a few weeks later the law enters into force.
However, in more conservative districts in Colorado, the prosecutors decided to deal with existing marijuana-related cases and continued to hold the drug accountable.
At the same time, in some cities from Denver suburbs to the west mountain areas, they vote in order to prevent the arrival of new, licensed shops for marijuana sales in their places.
"It's all developing so fast that I don't even know what to wait on," says Daniel J. Outs, the chief of the police in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
The supervisory authorities in Washington are also puzzled by their heads.
They have to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which must be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in resolving the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, the more ordered market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian E. Smith, representative of the Board for the Control of Production and Marking of Alcohol Products in Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than put forward some proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent for which we could focus," he says.
The State Act of Washington, D.C., called I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will bring the state into uncertainty for a year when State licensing systems are not yet available and the right to own the marijuana is already legalized.
There are still some difficult technical aspects that need to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's “appropriate access” orders to the licensed marijuana, with a ban on trade of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be especially difficult to place licensed marijuana trade enterprises in the city line, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingstone, a newly established research team called the Marijuana Legation Centre.
On 21 November, Outs Police Chief from Aurora sent an e-mail report to his subordinate that the City Procurator ' s Office would no longer involve persons aged 21 to be held accountable for the possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police ceased to disclose those violations “from now on”.
The Chief of Police reported that the police would monitor the city ' s compliance with the regulations governing the activities of the drug-producing marijuana and would pursue illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Weld District Prosecutor in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to hold the marijuana accountable, primarily in order to encourage the users to receive treatment.
At present, 119 persons have been charged with holding two or less marijuana ounces, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“The obligation of our institution to pursue actions that are considered criminal at the time of their commission”, said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Mesa village, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police of Grand Ganksn, the largest town in the district, no longer hold minors responsible for possession of a small amount of drugs.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges of the already open cases involving the possession of marijuana.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes, our direct responsibility," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the members of the State of Colorado voted in favour of this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for public and legal entertainment would not be easy.
Controversial reactions in various states have revealed the mixed attitudes of the local authorities to the state of marijuana.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier on the matter”, explains Shaun McAlister, a Denver lawyer representing the defendants for the possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for Marijuana Reform.
"They've been chasing people for it so long that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which the small number of marijuanas are treated as if alcohol were to be a pilot field on the national scale to verify the idea of drug legalization itself.
Responsibilities and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, which continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Reservants of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will retreat on this issue.
Despite several extensive arrests by traffickers and patients who used marijuana on medical evidence, the federal Government has in most cases benefited from the medical trade of marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The counter-narcotics agencies are unlikely to enter homes to confiscate a small marijuana packet, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the reciprocal marijuana stores controlled by the authorities, which are permitted under the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug advisor in the Obama administration.
Some towns in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential elections, some local administrations approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana sales shops that could not open earlier than in a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the western state, put a six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a situation as we're going to issue a license to someone, and then that will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local ballot and what the state voted for.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I was survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogy of an ancient symposium that lays the two foundations of civilization, freedom of thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks later, at the history Faculty of the Oxford College of Wooster at the end of the eighty years, I collected suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and cried.
Friends were confused.
The The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in a neighboring room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson was kidding me for leaving because I had to drink chicken cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, she ran away because I was systematically traumatized and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or what I was studying in private school.
I was only traumatized for one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Whitet, was a well-known adviser, Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a conservative supporter.
You'll ask, why do you think about it now?
According to recent data, the new generation of law - centerist students is subjected to the same trauma.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those granted to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators at Corpus Christy College student club in Cambridge state that they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the College ' s Committee on Equal Rights in order to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only exacerbated the recently released BBC 2 documentary on Student Policy, “Strange of Miracles: Young, Smart and Right”, in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazi.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford Conservatives Association, who travels to Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver nabald.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make “the leaveoffs due to higher school fees”.
Luc Black, 20 years old, Vice President of the Association of Conservatives of the University of Nottingham, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper, said that "the university environment has increased the shift towards left views.
People who don't even know us in advance consider us to be arrogant and ruthless children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the historical Faculty of Corpus Christy College, in which a request was made for strengthening protection, calls such an atmosphere “uncomfortable” and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Association of Conservatives of the Oxford University, said that the attitude of members of the Student Club to lawcentrists had deteriorated considerably.
"This constitutes a threat to both the intellectual atmosphere and just the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in a minority, I was alone.
I got there in September 1986, a silly and shy eighteen - year - old girl.
Oxford fevered against hatred of a conservative party.
The university voted a year earlier by depriving former student Margaret Tetcher of its honour due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In this atmosphere, even steelists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week, when the students got to know each other and the teachers, I first felt I was waiting for me.
I had not yet known that teachers had not only looked through their fingers on the digestion of conservative students, but they were happy to take part in it.
Political issues - the strike of miners, privatization and dissent by the Government to apply sanctions against the Government of apartheid in South Africa - penetrated through the wooden walls of the audiences.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared to follow.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now dead Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very yellow man with a face like a cake.
"Tetcherists don't teach French in principle or they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students leaked.
I have tears in my eyes.
"To you to take a few initial lessons of French at leisure time, if you are certainly not very busy, turning to the community," -- promulgated Pitt.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting alone at lunch, and then someone slammed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a student of the second class from the English Faculty, who was introduced as a member of the University Conservative Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlylylyly.
Regrettably, this is the following:
Anyone suspected of being sympathetic with the conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be more complicated.
Most conservative precursors pretend to be lieborists."
Later, in the local pub, I was shy about hypocrisy.
I insisted that I didn't agree with all that Margaret Tetcher says.
It didn't work out.
The student of the Faculty of Philosophy, Policy, and Economy, who himself studied in Iton, said, "You're a daughter of a Fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How do conservatives do sex?" one of them asked.
- They're battling each other, aren't they?
I felt like I must have felt homosexual before criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixtieths.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet my fellow minds only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to be a lieborist and hide my true beliefs?
For the next three years, I felt like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for being a foreign policy adviser and one of her counterparts.
He almost didn't appear at college.
He despised his provinciality, minority and commitment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a profession at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to go to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
All political views were adopted during his fortieth year.
"But this is the best university in the world," he complained.
- There's no way to do that, but not in a city of drowsy sprays...
Even my communist friends always acted perfectly."
His humid eyes are shattered.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You're gonna break my heart if you leave university."
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London, and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also the conservator, did not withstand pressure and abandon his beliefs.
Next week, during the seminar, when another history teacher really seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower of shame, I confessed that "I washed my parents' brains," and I called them "old fools."
It was a short break.
The last nail in my career tomb in Oxford was to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Merdoku’s publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later, my persecutors surrendered.
When they left, I picked up the suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me plaque and bastard.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be subjected to such malice and intimidation in the educational institution.
Worse still, it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of Tori, but is still concealed for the undeserved reputation of the university, which appreciates equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegant glory."
ABC interviews Naty Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica, and other famous Italian designer clients
Commercet House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to accept the exhibition of Valentino Haravani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of the Valentino: Shieldmaster, a triumphal retrospective exhibit, which combines more than 130 high-mode dresses created by his “house” over the past 50 years.
"I'm Gods of this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il signore" Garavani, but it could not be written without his identifiable clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, there are personal letters and photographs of the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Khan to Lord Snoudon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophys of his social recovery: from a modest portal from the city of Voger in northern Italy to a kumir of international “elites”.
Being in love with the royal court is not wrong.
"They don't at least extinguish the cigarettes of your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful pop-music stars do," says Baronessa Fiona Tissene-Bornema.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino’s disliked master accepts visitors with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his loaf in Gstayad," explains the former wife of Hani Tissen, a close friend of the forgotten beautiful people like Marella Anyelli or Eugenia Nyarhos.
Valentino always preferred elegant glory.
Even so, he's a star.
Valerie Maza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valerie Matz recalls a charisma modeler.
One day we went to dinner at his home, after showing fashions in Spain's area in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sheron Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was shown in every detail of his apartment, in her cleaning, in food, in music.
"Every of the guests Valentino felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that started with the modeler in 1995 during the High-Level Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of fashion because his sketches are the real works of art," she ends.
Parad of genealogies
Haravani's life is a story of not obsessions, but love with a full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somercet-house galleys was turned into a glamorous podium of 60 m long, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and has to deflect the podium, the sighters from the granes that burst out the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristote Yassis, the suit that Monica Vitty used in Nochi, or the coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Emperoric of Fara Diba.
In this publication, the names of Sibilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn Und Taxis, Mette-Mariit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg are well known.
Nati Abascal and modeller, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't forget."
I remember him perfectly.
They were pants, shirt, life, and a juket from the autumn winter collection of 1971-1972.
"It was the gift he made to me," says Naty Abaskal, one of the music of the designer.
"I prescribe him to the others for his wifehood, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds former Duchess de Feria.
I like the colors that he's using: they have a lot of light and they're "looking" to his face.
Proportions are perfect.
Princess and the Patricia della Jovampaol d'Arenberg, too, cannot forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilet...
Finally, that time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a garbage tube, a corse in a warehouse and a bretel without a bretel.
"It was a dream to be seen," says widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, his passion is out of time," explains this Italian aristocratic woman living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps his celebrities from a modeler with "maximal caution... because dress is not just a dress, it's also a combination of memories that accompany him."
"The King" of the fashions
A large final of the exhibition at Somersset House - Mari-Shantal Miller wedding dress for her wedding with Paul from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “women” (as the modeler of its necks) to produce this silk of ivory with pearl incursion, twelve species of different circles and a sleeves of four and a half meters.
According to Susie Menques, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of the tallest fashion of the late 20th century, the “return of higher-light clients”.
The elite's life-storm has been defamated for many years, and Valentino itself is its best representative.
The Big Cross Cavalier (a mark of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavaler of Labour, the Comandor of the Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Honourable Legion, Garavani collected the same honors as any of his clients.
"Every time, my attention attracted his delicateness, his tranquillity, his acquaintance, and his delicate appearance," recalls D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at the solemn dinner at Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was perfect, time does not exist for him."
If that says the princess...
The world's hardest profession: miners from Kawah-Iden
In four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur over the volcano by steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn sulphur earnings for life in the Kawakh Iden volcano, located in the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Each day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas rises from the depths of the earth is in contact with the air.
The gigantic pieces of sulphur, whose total weight can be 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, he picks up the basket and carries them up on a rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the wet loaders need more than 40 minutes to rise up by the turtle, hardly to keep the balance and be careful to pull the road to avoid falling back and falling off.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as was the case with one tourist from France who had crashed several years ago from the rocks of Cavah-Iden.
Kawakh-Jennah shaggers earn 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulphur that are extracted
Upon reaching the top, they pave the way between tourists who are photographed, as if they were monkeys from the circus and tired of heavy basket, three miles to the weights that the mining company had placed slightly higher at a height of 1,850 metres.
It is PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, rather than say, its employees, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) for petrochemical production, as it is common in everyday life and is used to make spears, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to evaporate sugar.
"Since the norm is 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (euro 3.8 euros) for each walk," Anto explains to us, which usually performs three daily movements.
It spends three hours on each of them, and at the end it feels broken, but it has accumulated 138,000 rupees (EUR 11.5) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a Miser for such an unhuman effort, it is three more than that he would have earned in the field.
“The day-to-day fee of miners is very high in local terms, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) pay for coffee and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)”, explains the truck who used to work as a rocketer on the Bali Tourist Island.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the section was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banjuwanga, a town near the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia was as crushing as sulphur: “I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus were, and brought her to Yawa to adopt Islam.”
Anto's got asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs all the time, and he's tearing his eyes off because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawakh Iden, whose sulphur had already begun to affect it despite the presence of a mask and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's constantly coughing, and his eyes tear up because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It's the price he has to pay for fulfilling his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
A punishable life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, waitress, or a porter in a hotel, but instead he does the mul.
For a dirty wooden cabin with other nostrils, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because the sulphur continues to flow out at night, when its typical yellow color becomes blue and glitters in darkness.
Throwing a challenge to the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, highlighting the road with a little lamp connected to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 nostallers carve basket sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur for cost savings and provided no equipment to the carriers who worked on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for photography, which, along with an incoming ticket of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve are taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its men.
"This is work for livestock, not for people," says Bandrusin, a root-in-law noiler for 42 years, who had spent three decades in Kawah Eden since he left college.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, and he's assured that he's going to endure work "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns its throat and burns its eyes when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so vigorous that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously, than their habitual breathing problems, artroses, pains in knees, and pestilences on their shoulders that were deformed under the weight of basket.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unicika can only raise 50 kilograms in its 53 - year - olds.
Each day he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur out of a volcano, which three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 kilometres of narrow tropical troughs.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, broadly opening his mouth with few teeth.
Of his five children, aged 30, he also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest things in the world: what human mules from Cavah Iden do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporees blame careers, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"Self-settlement needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, you're gonna fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of mussels, but even though -- or maybe because of that -- this video became a whiting on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the rest, which uses local sentences like, "Let's put the Bao (bull) in the liver" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that advertising will enable them to draw attention to the problem in a fun manner.
His creativity director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people fulfilled their national duty.
This thing is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that it was the subject that we should deal with.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do a lot, such as launching terromons or organizing quick dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing out of the possibility to solve this problem, namely, make a rap?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore is the one who does not understand this in such a light mind.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city in South-East Asia, also known as the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national public administration, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
For the last time, it was lower than 2, which is known as the percentage of substitution, in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Way Min, Director of the Marriage and Family Policy Office of the National Population Authority, says that the reason for “perfect education” and “a wider gamma of career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options for living goals and priorities other than weddings and family creation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of idle persons and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in Singapore ' s fertility rates.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims to sharply increase immigration in order to counteract the decline in the population, is a source of resentment among the local population.
Singapore has websites where there are barely hidden xenophobia for many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for low-level wages and reluctance to integrate.
Immigration growth was also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore ' s ruling party had received the worst results in elections since independence last year.
After the election, an attempt was made to address the problem, through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a well-known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical expenditures and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example has also begun to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has been supervised by the number of small apartments known as the "built box" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square metres are sold very well.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to a idle lifestyle and deprive developers of incentives to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director General of the EL Developers Domestic Company, says that their "built boxes" are sold much faster than more spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are to be purchased for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, he recognizes that new rules provide clearer guidance to developers who had previously been struggling if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too heavy
Singapore is a city State.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans working in the financial quarter of the centre, they seem to have no special effect.
"People are very strained, housing is expensive, as is education, and that's why many people delay it," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have my own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter what the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to be born, with regard to childbirth, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Offline Personal - Online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is the property of private or “the sphere of personal life that is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for a minor under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that are being put on the Internet when dealing with situations that are unlikely to be shared outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys from 10 to 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in their personal plane, and "paraol and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets, I wouldn't put them in my post," says 10-year-old Jorge, when he's trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he's got records for two years.
"These are very secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or play pictures on FB.
Also, I am entertaining with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine or someone who behaves stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not easy to publish unkind pictures of naked people, crimes, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures him he knows 35 friends he has in FB and nine of his Fallovers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows, she has a password for one of the accounts.
I brought Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I'm answering, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends quickly," he says.
Without wondering, he answers that he would never have accepted a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't be treated with someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
José's 14-year-old case is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last, he admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one was trusted and asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm pressured or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follow-up Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy is not strange to the experience of what is today known as cybermobing.
One of my friend's friends was blackmailing on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not remove the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photographs of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I don't like a man, or if I want to.
"I want to know it's cybermobing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and an educator, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to realize that social networks are intended to be informed.
"The internet came up as a tool to find information, but with these websites, the rules of the game changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prinski, a teacher of the Yale University and an author of the work of Digital Aboriginals and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people who were born in an age of technology.
"We're digital immigrants who have to teach them while we're still learning," she says.
Explains that this subject is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, as aged, when maturity is not enough to do so."
"So that they are selective, whereas the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that children and adolescents are confidential is to ask questions that cause them to reflect.
"Tell them not to do this, it's useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign pictures of parties, do you ask for permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one thing, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them realize that they have to act online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“On the Internet, a person behaves respectfully, with responsibility and with other principles, as well as in social networks,” she claims.
Being vigilant
Estoardo Guardia, university teacher, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networking policies in good faith.
Understanding each paragraph, they have good grounds for talking to children about the assumptions of opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind the children of the lesson: "Don't talk to strangers."
Unassur Summit ends without proclamation of the Lima Declaration
The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the proclamation of the Lima Declaration, previously declared and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after the closure, but have subsequently confirmed that it will be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
Concerning questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were made by President Olyant Umala of Peru during the summary statements for the press.
Journalists were constantly limited in access to the Summit information.
It was only broadcast during the day, in the press room, the Presidential Assembly's video without sound, with the message “closed meeting, sound banned”.
A few of the information that was circulated among the reporters was transmitted by the Spokespersons of some UNASUR Governments present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Presidential Administration of Peru sent an electronic message to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umala's statement, not the official document to be completed by the summit.
In October last, Peru had adopted the III Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and the so-called Lim Declaration, which had previously been announced, had not been circulated, despite the persistence of the press.
On the official ASPA web site, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have sought to ensure that all journalists receive transmission systems, but have maximized the availability of information.
The Summit also culminated in a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Oljant Umala and Chile, Sebastian Piniera, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which would begin on Monday in The Hague to hear the statements of the two parties, as part of the charge made by Lima against Santiago.
“We will respect and comply with a decision that will explain the differences that we are currently submitting to this international court,” said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Chile was, is, and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, Covenants and international tribunals”, added Piniera, and welcomed Umal’s hands in the background of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they are subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia challenged the Bogot Pact this week, according to which it recognized the subordination to the verdicts of that international court following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered incorrect.
The summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rucef, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Christina Kirschner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impression of his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later than noon on the Lima Time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and had been approved for 31 projects among the South American countries, an estimated investment amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements that had been adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are extending the residence agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “cooperation against the insecurity of citizens and against organized transnational crime, actions to improve access to medicines, affordable access to the Internet in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in a crisis, the “economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis but should serve as a means of expanding our productive framework and foreseeing the better future for our cities”, Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 marking projects that will improve South America's linkage, especially in rural and border zones... by combining our countries and creating new economic schemes”, said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and limited to cross-cutting points in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at much communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, which is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united and to have good relations among neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In that regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before taking part in the regional meeting, he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for negotiations in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Last day, maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
“We shall revise all these paths, they are not mutually excluding, including the Nicaraguan Pact, will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with it in the best possible civilized and respectful manner," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have a presence for the post of the new President of that country, Enrique Penja Nieto.
Also at the summit, the Defence Ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter ' s participation has been suspended.
Peru has temporary Presidentship in the regional bloc.
“South America should learn from Europe on the issue of the integration of citizenship: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of general citizenship was a goal in which “South America, in this case, should learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, stated to Peru ' s State television that the Europeans “have killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one home.”
It has protected, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which approves the countries parties to UNASUR.
"It is important to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also been a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lectures never take on any obligations, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington, D.C. and is financed by the United States,” he said, pointing to the political asylum given by Ecuador by the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanju.
Correa assured him that he did not regret the decision because he did not betray his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that, in due course, “there were some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be respected”.
He further criticized Swedish justice for the requirement to come to his territory for interrogation concerning the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through a videoconferencing that could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that Assanja's physical and mental health was at risk.
"I haven't talked to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a little lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What's true is the risk of deteriorating his physical and mental health because he's in a small space without being able to do exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any human," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted by Assanju since June in the Embassy of London, through the provision of security guarantees that would enable him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the founding of WikiLeaks.
We have not negotiated human rights; we have not used that word in this case, but have been continually debated.
“The decision of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assanja's lawyer Baltasar Garson is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions”, he said.
And the view was that “if Britain will provide a guarantee of integrity tomorrow, it will be over.”
And if Sweden, as best she can, and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Señor Assanja in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him on Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to show himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not endure “the mediation, insinuity and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
“The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support gains, blackmails and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he was pleased that neither those journalists, “no bankers, nor bourgeois-gehemon countries do not dominate in Ecuador”, and added that, when re-elected, “will deepen the revolution for the continuation of development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay at least before the next elections, arguing that the organization “should not tolerate the opportunism and the backing of the coups under the mask of the rule of law”, because, in fact, “the rule of law of Paraguay's democracy has broken down”.
The Ecuadorian President also considered the “perfect” desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which was in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not currently being respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They need to be processed together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the dispute on the maritime boundaries that took place in the same court of Peru and Chile would be well concluded and said that “It was right for Latin America to apply to international authorities if two countries committed to making a decision, no matter how difficult it was”.
With regard to the possibility of speaking as a candidate for the forthcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive period, he pointed out that he was considering this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although it was sometimes difficult”.
Correa assured that if he lost the election in February 2013, he would leave public life.
In personal terms, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only by the political authorities.
"My political movement felt that it was me that I guaranteed this probable victory, so that I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
In the case of victory, this would be my last term of office as President, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is the solution," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to a new treatment course for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he went to treatment that was already planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a deterioration of President Chavez's health state," he explained.
The Head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
The factory was 21 when he was declared that his AIDS analysis had a positive effect.
"I'm as if I've been deaf," he recalls that hard, despite the doctor's tact, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
When he decided to deal with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much as possible and his efforts were justified, he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the “oldest” HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he reached many obstacles in 1994.
He has been living with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for the past 22 years.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had cuts."
In other words, AIDS was a sentence at that time.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to do so without the worst quality of life.
Nonetheless, not knowing of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already done damage, “suffered” their immune system and suffers from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement is that the survival of a patient who starts to treat in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same”, said HCG Head of HIV, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in the prestigious scientific edition in April of this year.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that, since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depended on the degree of injury to the immune system of patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs, up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and 50 years when 500 CD4 are reported.
Simply put, the foregoing means that the person who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “sustaining control will be able to live without problems up to 75 years”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be borne in mind that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients have died in the national database since AIDS.
In Khalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths were recorded by May of this year; however, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there any fatal outcomes yet?
- In person, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine it, it's what's going on in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have had no lack of medicine, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their condition, that is, late stages of disease.
He reported deplorable data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what must be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality rate, so to conduct a diagnostic at an early stage, and so it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection, for all the people who ask it.”
The proposal concurs with the opinions of experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Khalisco (COESIDA) as well as the patients themselves, such as the Fabrício, who had turned to the private laboratory for verification, only because his friend had done so and, despite his young age, had already been at the AIDS stage and had even suffered from the Sark Caposhi, a cancer that was one of the prevalent complications.
Everything changes when you know you're having AIDS.
Some think they'll die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I still die, I'd rather wear three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There's a positive change, I eat well, I do exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with two responsibilities, I take care of myself and another person," said Fabrigio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO in order to raise his statement to those who are now in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this 2012.
Trap condoms
A great gap between health programmes and a simple citizen is believed by Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara who has dealt with HIV-related issues.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places devoted to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out there are those who still have no access to the condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you?" is a popular question, with ridicule and condemnation, by social workers, school consultants, pharmacy officers and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that the condoms be not just for the trunks and that a hundred of them be in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
It's not the promotion of loose conduct.
It was not the payment of beer and motel, and the Governor, Emilio González, replied when he was asked whether the condoms could be disbursed under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) were registered.
The State ranks four in the national rating on new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of infections relate to sexual traffic, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to perinatal paths.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as one recorded case is between 4 and 5 people who do not know.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that would cancel the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a rocket precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country with problems with payment capacity.
It appears that procedures in support of the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the country of strips and stars in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the decision rendered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hail on the courts of bankruptcy of the northern Texas district leaves the Mexican firms unprotected in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the side of Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the doors to the lead-maker of glass in Mexico for referral to the United States Supreme Court, arguing three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings concerned competitive proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies an abolition of international judicial cooperation in cases of incapacity to pay transnational enterprises.
In fact, to this end, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law has been established, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an inter-firm ballot recognized in the critical mass of competitive arrears that had to be held before the mother's company, the branches of Vitro would not have achieved the majority necessary for restructuring approval.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicoa, whose inter-firm debts the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing guaranteed.
It is also true that by deciding on the voices of the branches, Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely, the “sterlets” funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach most.
The vote would be 45 per cent, against 37.
These data are dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that that had faced since 2008, which had been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States had witnessed, with its impact on the country.
In the meantime, the company of González Sad will appeal the judgement to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote will reach his plenary, that is, five judges, because only three have voted.
In the event of failure, an application will be made for a certificate that will require a review of the trial by the High Court in the case of the United States Supreme Court.
Worse yet, the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as an amicus curiae (“other court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competitive Proceedings Act, indicating that it frees itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of inter-State incapacity to pay, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
The carabol on two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
In view of the several-monthly delayed complaints placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviacion against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union of Aviation Pilots has already found a bottleneck.
The station led by Carlos Dias Chávez Morino has just filed a criminal case against the National Banks and Securities Commission, which is accused of impediment to justice.
According to this, the oversight body systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic concerning the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to recover from the trust fund F/589 of Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicoa Airlines.
Resources would be devoted to the purchase of shares of the Professional hotel manager ' s company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Circle Dragon Mart
Meeting at a forum weekend at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counter the discovery of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the isolated country, with a living zone nearby for 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra was able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone in order to counter the monumental forces, which have overshadowed the land of the protected territories and pose serious threats to the industry.
ACTA Death
The Senate's request to the Government to explain under what circumstances and circumstances the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed a trade agreement to combat counterfeiting, known as an abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, has already been archived.
As you know, the action has been carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself has disqualified the opportunity to view it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.

Hector Hetin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
A busy basketball traveler, Hector Hetin Reyes, was more than 60 years tied to this sport and, thanks to it, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And before bleeding into the brain in 2008, Reyes was stuck in sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, the High Basketball League player, the Commissioner and Head of BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamon and the President of the Federation of Basketball.
“I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few times as President BSN, General Director of the National Command and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during his visit to Biamond, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things assembled for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his journey through Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a contract agent or agent.
"It was my best years that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, an agent or leader.
Many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye to one in 1981, in the year Jeroma Minsi's debut in BSN.
From that point on, Kuko Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has continued to be headed.” Reyes said.
I remember that Jean Bartov, who was travelling here to Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsie, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended a sniper of Raymond Gauss, who got citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the Baamon championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy Championship with Gauss, but I was far away, because by 1988 I was the head of the Federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national assembly of Minsi.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. during the Olympic Qualification Tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got our fourth seat and it was to be a bronze, if it weren't the Canadian judge who had forced us to play the final game, said Reyes.
That team of the 1990 World Cup is the best collection you've ever seen?
She's among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that with the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the U.S. assembly, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze in the world championship.
Not only were Minsi, Gauss, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopes and Pikulina (Ortis), but also young (Havyer) 'Tonjito'' Colon and James Carter, Leon Brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Kichote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in personal composition, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament team in Neuken, Argentina.
With Role Players like 'Canito' Nyewes', Pablo Alice and young Rolando Hurrutner in exchange for players who were temporarily suspended for riot at the Pan American championship of Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Pickulin Ortiz.
Its indicators are impressive in international tournaments.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Piculin did.
And it's not taking into account his career in the different leagues in which he was playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love Leo Arilla's work from young people.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous national assembly period between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national play-off.
Now, guys travel and play too much, and that's too much.
At least I see the results of mandatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I'm listening to music, watching music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren, and sometimes I'm going to basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Isabel, which has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dead
Larrie Hegman, born on 21 September 1931, in Fort Wart, Tehas, became universally known because of his chief role as John Ross Yugh, more known as J.R., in the Dallas television series, where he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as an oil magnetist predator Jay Ar Yung in the Dallas television series, was a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hehmann, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday evening due to complications caused by cancer, according to the family ' s statement for the The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown Dallas, once again playing an important role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the fair for the Day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in Sikwell, was next to Hegman when he died in Dallas hospital, said to her representative Jeffrey Lain.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was the original person and lived full life," confirmed Gray in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had a malignant tumor in the liver and was transferred to transplant.
Long before the Dallas, Hehman gained his reputation on television because of the role of a decent type in a light comedy called I Dream of Jeannie, which was broadcast by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets the attractive gin girl that Barbara Iden plays and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the chief character of two comedians, which rarely appeared in the air, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and the "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included the roles well-adopted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the abhorrent J.R. that led Hehman to the top of fame.
The CBS Dramatic Channel Serial on the Yuing Clan and other characters in its surroundings was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who Did Shoot in J.R." designed to create a noise around the episode, full of emotion, in which Hegman's character is almost killed, has created international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked by the bookkeeper offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million televisioners watched it and turned Dallas into a second count of entertainment in history, after MASH's final in 1983, which attracted 50 million spectators.
It was J.R., Christine (in the execution of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. hindered her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hehman played Yugh as an unsatisfactory corrupter with a charismaic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and a disloyal husband who wanted his wife, the alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) to be treated.
"I know what must be on J.R's tomb plate," said Hehman in 1988.
It must be said, “Here rests an honest citizen of J.R. Yugh.”
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principle, too, the hero of the original Serial, remembered on Friday, Hegman, "the big one, both on and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of worshipers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dalas were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, reported the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements that will be with the series after Hegman left.
Fort Wart, Texas, he was the son of an actress and the singer Mary Martin, who brilliant in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave him birth in 1931 during her marriage with Ben Hagman's lawyer.
He tried to be happily at the theatre scenes in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the BAF of England from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met and married a young Swedish artist named Mie Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he called his "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't include anything that would feel capable of hurting someone or affecting them in any way," he said to the Prensa Asociada at the time.
After the liver transplanted, he promoted the donorship of the organs and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help the feared patients.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starts a course that is being studied by the End of Light.
Every week, students study apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of the religion, Stuart Sharma, decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an inevitable lure: the end of the Maya's long backward calendar, on 21 December, which many people took to hold as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharm had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane of Sandy, the financial crisis that some call long-termarmageddon, and the growing conflict to which Israel would enter, where the Christian theorists of the end of time believed that the Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharm this week to the students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we look at what is happening in the world at present, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad things are good for those who have apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the light" in this semester, the theoretically last in history.
At Temple University, Professor Barry Waxer, adjudicator, reads the course “The media, culture and end of the world”.
Every week students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas are being spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios suggest certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
"I tried to tell the students what might be true and impossible," said Wakeer.
At the main campaign of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin America, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called simply "Light End".
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world does not come," said Restall.
Despite “nominal destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In the state of Penn, the final examination will be taken to the Apocalypse Canon, which leaves no choice for students except to work “before the very night that the end of the world is supposed to come,” said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"The city ended in two hours," said Restall about his high-level course for high-level students with 35 students.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the semester started from people who asked if there was any room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort myself," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student from the Hadddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychology and nursery student, said that he watched all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach it," he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone the professor -- said he believed on the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project affected Maya's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is a apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has been a number of centuries where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Predominantly in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of religion at La Sal University, who was teaching courses this year in the Philippines, promptly answered the question of whether he knew of any course on the end of light there.
“Philippines shall not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote, pointing to the superior authority.
We have a pardon from Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time, many of the days of the last court had been mentioned and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would start to think about the next date” or to philosophize that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world would end.
Students and teachers treat this date unnecessarily.
Some said they were going to go to the party of "the end of the light."
"Maybe I'll call some of my friends to laugh together," she commented to Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Telecommunication Faculty.
