White sand on f3, black sand on e6, white sand on g4, black on h4 - ute!
White: palms on a1, pitch on b6, king on c8. Black: sands on a7 and b7, kings on a8, elephants on b8. White men put their rivals in the position of the bugswang by a6, followed by the black ones with only two choices: to take a6 pitch, or to move the elephant into any other field of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move the sand from b6 to b7 and put the black sand on a7 and the result is the same.
