I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
There were lots of girls at the party.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make a impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom pretended nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He pinned the bottle.
We're home now.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You just run away from life's problems.
Outside of the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the examination.
Eat till it's hot.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Mary's an idiot.
I told him to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Last week I stumbled in Boston on Tom.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked cooking.
I told him you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Do you want anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what to do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bicycle.
I'll pay now!
Would you like to drive?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're peers.
A coin rolled under the table.
She's empty.
Wash the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here, the rest are out.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
Of the 50 camels, the caravans were moving unhappily in the desert.
You should be ashamed of your own ignorance.
I changed my place with Tom.
Tom went into the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom would hardly lose.
Tom said Mary wanted to drink.
What are you kidding about?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get around.
Didn't I tell you I had allergies on peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show him any more.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to disappoint Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He's on his way to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win again.
The cosmonauts are wearing vaults.
Algeria buys artillery from Russia.
Should I tell you what happened?
I have nothing to give you.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
It's empty in this room.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We were sleeping under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Isn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
It's one of five senses.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you made a name for a newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got a cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I still go to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The humpback grave will be corrected.
Soup is so hot that it can't be eaten.
Why is it so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where are you hurt so much?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I've been waiting for good news from them.
Distilled water is unpleasant.
Father's in the garden right now.
Harry works part-time at the local supermarket.
It's very unlikely that I'm late.
I told them to be in the hats.
Tom said he was really tired.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning on breaking up with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom locked the door in his bedroom.
I knew Tom for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom's very good at violin.
Nobody blames you.
The next year is the year the Rabbit.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What have you learned?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have books.
Tennis is the only sport Tom knows well.
Come to the fire.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember I love you.
He's said to be a killer.
Mary didn't want to wear Halloween's frank suit, so she decided to dress like a woman-amish.
Tom picked up his hat.
Tom waited three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I'm not going to be that way anymore.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I watched you do.
He's got great math skills.
Careful, on the road.
He's a new-marriage father.
The men were then men.
The Swiss banks are very secret.
Once you complete your mission, you can drink how much you think.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom's gonna say when he finds out?
Christmas is nearing.
Do you want us to do this together?
All of our attempts were empty.
He poured himself another glass.
Now I'm going to take a look at the patient, make sure you have tracked the correctness of this procedure, you have to turn to the use of it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom was sleeping in the barn.
You'll ruin your eyes.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie genre?
So I didn't have to ask me twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped out of joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many deficiencies.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
On your face, you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a corrupt plastic.
I can't let him go alone.
It was Tom's window broken.
Jesus, allowing the demons to enter the flock of pigs, demonstrated the steadyness of God’s Law on Unclean Animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we'll be fine.
We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
It's my birthday today.
We have to tell people what to do.
If she's inexpensive, I'll buy her.
I told you what I should do.
She almost drowned.
That was a good movie.
Are you a leak?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom forbidded me to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave up his anger.
The missing boy was identified on his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it was like.
She likely refuses to follow his counsel because she does not like him.
Did you write that?
I know you're working for them.
I hope I can help you.
Are your parents aware of this?
The waitress was on the table with a white scooter.
That day, I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy in the vicinity?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
That helps a bit.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?
I work for the oil company.
Why don't you find someone who needs your help?
Tom put a wet towel in Mary's forehead.
He hurt his left hand.
She's Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to seem shy.
Could you tell me something about yourself?
Did you find the difference between these two pictures?
I've never seen so many books assembled in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
Cats have a wool tongue.
I'd never do that.
Correct it, please.
We need to put a ice bag on the cheetah to reduce the wreath.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here tonight.
"Who are you national?" "Argentines."
Why are you sad?
I can do it much better than you do.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The umbrella's broken.
Tom put his room in order.
Did you complain?
I don't really like Tom.
That's why I'm gonna have to change my plans.
Someone bit him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before we left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new dress?
Fear was on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
You're the one to blame.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Get her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Smell it.
Tom is awakening from a deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do that.
I hope I'll see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why it happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right, before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm really upset.
As often as it is, Mike's late this afternoon for a meeting.
Tom told me Mary had a new guy.
We don't let that happen.
These fools have violated the law prohibiting a violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loudly that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to him.
It's a weird rumor.
I know you're rich.
Bill put back a hundred dollars for a trip.
He served in the Navy.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom wrinkled his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want it to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not gonna screw up.
He's in the car and he's gone.
Tell him about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom has been in pain for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies the last.
It's a girl who came in yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You kind of said it was yours.
Where did he get these shoes?
Don't make me do that.
What did you smile?
Tom usually rides for work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
Is that how I think?
Everyone but Tom has hats.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that sold?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have that much?
That's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me what Mary saw tonight.
Tom heard the bastard sound in the bathroom.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse stood there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's a little sugar in the package.
I did that when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't be embarrassed about anything else.
Who's in the blue T-shirt?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for sight.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I would have written her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom's birching.
It's about half a third.
The lion is powered.
I had to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy corrected the hat.
Maybe we should take a walk.
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of cats.
I heard you're a good gangjo game.
Did you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom's awfully speaking French.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You're not eating with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I'm barely sitting on the train.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fantastic movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is outside the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you a good look now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 repressions.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom a hush, threw a glass of wine through him, and a firm step went out of the restaurant, a dead silence arose.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We learned them.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom could swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone is interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I disagree with him.
This is called luck.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through my fuss.
How many aircraft are in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Sleep again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom knows he doesn't need him anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in winter pots.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why are everyone watching me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long do you wake up?
Get the garbage out.
Tom apologized to the listeners.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy a candle?
Canada is the home of Hokkey on the ice.
The brain is a very complicated body.
They'd have agreed.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief got through the window.
Spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss no whiskers like salt-free soup.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
So much has happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired of death.
Do you know what your kids are doing now?
You want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Tom kept chirping her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who was eating a garbage tank yesterday.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed that John was crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told him he should talk to a lawyer.
What, did they take the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom is an anti-Semit.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like to be pushed.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbas sang a song to Neclayev's words, could she have imagined that he would run for the presidents?
There's yogurt in the refrigerator.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom always speaks frankly.
The Thomas's got to be there by 230.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why don't you look for him?
They survived despite the destruction of the building.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned down.
John is not careful, he makes a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's that guy?
Keep the kids away from the pond.
We'll talk about it tonight.
I have to fix it.
They don't know French.
Relax!
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three granddaughters.
He wants peanut oil.
You're so lucky.
Tom's starting to drink a little bit.
I barely understood him.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still don't feel comfortable.
I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red is better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do that yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a word?
Don't make a noise like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We eat at six.
The deer was the victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom is a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to convince her to help us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
It can lie in the water for ten years, but it won't be a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you manage to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What ego!
So you bought it?
The man is as old as he feels, and the woman is what she looks like.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want a daughter yet?
I like walking along the river.
You can quite come with me.
This dictionary is a great gift to us.
"How long before dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary's been spending all her time at work.
Tom got on his motorcycle and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes already?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I waited for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing he gets into his head.
Why do you want to leave?
How'd French be "bye"?
It wasn't that expensive.
What do you have with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not gonna fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you gonna spend that big money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that every week of the world disappears in one language.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we'd talked about it.
How sad my parents would have been if I had failed.
I'm feeding a cat every morning and night.
Hold your tongue, you don't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before making any changes to the existing code.
I can't bite, I don't have teeth.
I think you did a great job.
Last night we had heavy rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I damaged my neuronostop.
I don't have anything else to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She was sitting on the chair and reading the magazine.
It is forbidden to cry from now on.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
Here's the house he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the monkey.
Eat my chocolate?
Beautified in white, the house seems bigger.
I have difficulty finding the original quotation.
I had no idea you knew her.
What is the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give him more time.
You haven't told me what Tom says in French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a film on French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was a good player.
He only blames others, and he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play banjo?
Tom came to Mary and hug her.
"When do you come back?" "All depends on the weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is it?
Your message has been received.
To complete the construction of my house, I had three years.
I was annoyed.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom is likely to win.
What would you like Dead Moros to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where is your adventurer's spirit?
Why were you angry with me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his people to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done that yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in the hat.
Put it on the floor.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles traveling on this road.
You deceived us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
To pretend that you make me believe that I believe in what you do not believe.
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
Do you think that's possible?
He got sick to finish everything.
Do you think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, I don't think he knew you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave it to yourself.
Are you reading anything but the Bible?
Please read me the statement from the cat.
What does this gentleman do for his life?
Why do you think that Too likes it?
Are your parents aware of that?
Are they talking about you?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoeba is not to speak of the thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four dollars.
Because of the strike, I had to cancel my trip.
I don't know your name.
How much train does it take to Boston?
What are the words to this song?
Mary likes to tease her brother.
The law's on my side.
So I had to find where to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was adorned to the date of the professor's birth.
You had your phone a few times while you were in the shower.
She came out for him because of the money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just a superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
Account, please.
Your shoes must always be clean.
You've got a birthday soon.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom had been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I've downloaded on the Internet.
I think that's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Clearly, he is the best person to do this.
You make it easier for me to work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't look like you're very busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom left the room without saying a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
You've finished lunch yet?
Tom and Mary talked at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How many tie do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the last rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a scrap.
My mother taught me not to waste money.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I yelled for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it matters to you.
They all knew her.
We'd better stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm awfully hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's looking after the horses.
Why does Tom not agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
Usually people die if they're killed.
They turned Tom off the lifesaving apparatus.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom's twice as young as you.
Tom shut the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you tell Tom first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
Twelve hours' journey made me tired.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do that.
He came back two days later.
Tom's gone late.
We must be at home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help him wash the windows?
It's beyond my competence.
It was yesterday.
I love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm too much here.
Don't tell me what happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What do you say then?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed these cards to my friends.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.

I guess I'll be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup gives the fish.
There are lots of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win time.
I already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among people, talked about the horrible, Jewish dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus demonstrating the failure of allegations of any sacred language, whose use in prayer draws special attention to God.
After all, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'm gonna ask Tom to prepare you for something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I play a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.

Is that my book?
Laundry is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't let him get my phone.
I've already decided who I'll go with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He reads physics in Oxford.
He was hiding this fact from me.

I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.

Why won't you be tomorrow?
We need to get to know each other better.
Somebody said something, but I didn't.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get himself to the hospital.
I sat down next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think that medicine will be very useful.
Tell him to be here by half the third.
It's not a god of news, what science.
Tom suspected Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it's raining.
Want a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the threshold of hungry death.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I'm thinking of doing some more!
My favorite color is blue.
I have made some corrections.

The bus was overcrowded.
Where do you want to go next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a humiliation.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
That car's a good sale.
I have to work for these weekends.
You can't do that to us.
His words made me embarrassed.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what to do.
Say hello to her.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer was shocking.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in return?
I have to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is cruel.
I've got a good dream.
That's why there's nothing to do with anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sidzuki.
Tom drank all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he is free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in thirty minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you very much for staying with me.

Tom's yelling at Mary.
This is my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom kind of told me Mary's from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Again and again, obstacles arise in our lives, some call them problems, others speak of opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog grazing in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know it won't happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need actions, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You just run away from problems.
A house without women like a flowerless garden.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with that.
I put it on the cream of bait.
Don't leave the glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind's over.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.

I knew you could be trusted!
Tom put the firewood.
"Love never killed anyone." "Do you ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like the operation of the virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.

Have you ever salted?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school, isn't he?
Let us know.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have any pain somewhere?
He couldn't go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door or we're breaking it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why you can trust.
There are a lot of mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salt?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's a rotten apple.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is the favorite city of Tom.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you getting better?

That was a bad rate.
The thought of being alone bothered me.

He will definitely come.
Do you have a message?
Yesterday, Tom called me unexpectedly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I decided to give up.
Unhappily, they were taken away by their only son.
Everyone knows there's something new in this old capital.

She doesn't like my manner of speaking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you're doing with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't go to Boston car.

What do you like in him?
When I arrived at the station, I called my friend.
I need a plane ticket to Moscow.

Sometimes it is necessary to speak the truth.

I have a suggestion for you.
Did she like dinner?

Who would want to kill him?
I've been hurrying.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's going to school until late night.
Tom's room is very small.
You speak Italian?
The girl smiled for me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them that we could.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns in his furnace both a tree and a coal.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't stop laughing at her jokes.
By means of the prophet Zechariah, God foreshadowed the reconciling of the kingship and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Every one of us went to our home.
The thread's thin, but strong, and it's not.
It's a little stupid.
I don't know what I want at this point.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for the TV!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really so bad?
Tell me, please, where you'll live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
It's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I was not handsome.
Are you crying a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read it before.
If the car breaks, let's walk.

Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody does it.

That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is obfuscious.
I get whatever I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bathroom.
Tom and I are growing up.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't say that about Tom.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Next year Tom will teach French.
I've listened to her for the rest.
I told him to rest.
Why does that hurt you?
The worst part of the trip's over.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in his shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
That knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
It'll take you only a minute.
That's the situation I'd like to change very much.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a protein in a wheel.
He didn't survive.
Don't you want to come with us?
Tom can swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're going to leave as soon as possible.
He's riding skiing on Hokkaido.
"Stop your fucking music and read the book." "Look, my censorship still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're getting blood out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom's in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same as you.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join in.
Tom wanted to ask Mary to forgive me again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He's never been.
I really would like to come with you, but I can't.
That's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's go quickly, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How are they taking you?
Where are you going to live?
Usually I'm a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at stake.
Mary sewed Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to take.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked me to do.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary got better after the disease.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
Eating meat harms your health and the environment.
You tell me you don't know anything about that?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to talk a word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I wish I didn't know Tom's phone.
"You told him?" "No, he learned everything."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.
Sahara is the world’s largest source of dust.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.

Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is Ivo crying.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
Are you a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut a razor.
Tom and Mary seem more than just friends.

Tom, I don't think he knew me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I used to lie down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom's doing is watching TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pearl I've ever eaten.

Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom never was late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go and ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
You're hard to take seriously.
The tribes settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it begin?
Nobody cares about what she thinks.
I don't think that's strange at all.
"Where do you get my phone?" "Tom gave."
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Is there any point in doing this?
Why do you lock the door?
Tom said he was trying to do it three times.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.

Change the subject.
I love traveling around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's not high, but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She's cooking dinner.
Please find Tom.
He'll give it to you.
The proposal is not clearly written.
What would you do?

You don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you're fat?

Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is infinite!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's jelly.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
It seemed like he was going to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
It's unlikely to happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
It's our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat, it's cold tonight.
If you think about it, I really need a cell phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a horrible man!

Don't be mad at him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.

Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you get closer?
She's a little shy.
What are you expecting from Tom?
She seemed completely calm.

I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.

Everything's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree over there.
Do you typically wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix that.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.

Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
What's my story?

Thank you for helping him.
Tom could have told me.
This will bring misery to your family.
I was really nervous.

I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.

You need to try not to sleep.

Tom's got a snake on his back.
You bought meat at the supermarket?
He hit me by a mistake.
What's the name of this dog?
Go on the sidewalk.

It's like raining like a bucket.
The whole country's talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
Happiness won't buy.

The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the present situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it was not as difficult to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom.
They say that the film is very interesting.
Do something with that, please.
As you know, we're late because of heavy rain.
She seems to be healthy.
Tom was in his straw hat.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for the permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you dinner yet?
I love a bitter pepper.
How much do you usually stand on Saturday?
I added milk to coffee.
How can I change this?

I love you so much, I'm not waiting for you when I see you.
Why are you in my shoes?

Why call?
I don't like people who insist on political talk.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom didn't get used to that kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
What's the matter, you're suddenly in the fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born again.
Tom's got a pirate suit.
It's pure truth!

Why didn't you ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
That's why Mary had to be invited.

I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.

You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom had never seen Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?

I'd like to talk to her again.

He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.

I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom plays the trombon.
You're from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You may not be able to do that.
Excuse me for doubting you.

To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want as much better.
Tom's a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from underestimation?
Was it too simple?
What Alice faced, waiting for her answer, was a sudden warrior, a loud noise so sharp that she could break down her drums, and so loud to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I was just trying to solve the problem.
You should've done your homework.
I talked on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That stone was so heavy that I couldn't raise it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
It's going to auction, and it's going to respond.
We've taken a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?

You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
I've got Tom's youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're glad.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can't you solve this question?
Tom and Mary are here.
Why would he do that?
In the 20-floor building.
If you don't go, I'm not going either.
You don't know when Tom comes back?
I don't have Tom's photos.
Can you wait a little?
Are you going to give him something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm a Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you do.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long are you planning to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling all right?
He's stubborn like a donkey.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew it was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom had a dream last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but some girl took the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We must follow the plan.
I'll tell you what you called.
Tom is very strict to children.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix majorise with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom's got little oysters.
Do you understand what she said?
You're some kind of dispersed.
Don't piss her off.
I'd better stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's resting right now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who did you talk to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect I should go to Boston next week.
Don't go outside the land.
Tom was horrible.
Tom's face is painted.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept; he always had enough food.
The hall needs a new curtain.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the rat?
How long do you want to go?
She was in pain with her legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important to both of us.
We have to get you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom twisted forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't often do that.
I hope we won't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get it, there'll be an opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also good to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned a flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Fom's gone from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
We cried with him.
Don't you want to try again?
Wait a little more.
What's the matter with you?
Milk can be made of oil, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I've got a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her family?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dig a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for the younger daughter.
Be good.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unfamiliar guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He snapped back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think of asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
Nobody's hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflakes in the snow lavine feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He's wide open his mouth.
It's a spit.
I liked the book very much.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would have stayed overnight.
Tom didn't tell the police his real name.
I went to school.
The fish is still raw.
Try to maintain a positive attitude.
I was sick.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
There was a big red hat at the girl.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who to play Tom?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
Don't you come in?
I repaired his radio.
It's a very bad idea.
Tom is higher than you.
Tom found a job.
Is that a book in public access?
Please, can you talk more loudly?
I'll tell him to contact Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please address me, not except Jacob Mattweević.
She's not alone anymore.

I've been to America.
It took more time than I expected.

The moon is a satellite of the Earth.
I don't know.
There's nothing useless in nature.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it purposely!
You don't need it.
Tom rarely goes to the parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
I look like a guy who wants to get married?
I locked the door, but I didn't lock it.
That's why you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Are we gonna help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so severe with me.
Now I'm commanding the parade!
People who are good for all our years.
I'm not sorry for you.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not here.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to marry on 20 October.
She thought I'd let her down.
Now I live in Boston.
Tom brought his secret to his grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do that.
We're teachers.
You probably like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do that again.

Tom paid Mary a very decent salary.
What do you think?
Let's get breakfast soon.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!

We need to fix the cross.
I thought you were right.
Why are everyone looking at us?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did I make your name right?
Nobody saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He let them walk in the garden.
I don't have a crystal ball.
Your love is false.

You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys and girls are girls.
It's time for you to lie down, turn off the radio.
His addiction to alcohol is not new.

He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave it to you.

I'm convinced of my rightness.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You have time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
That's why we should go with Mary.
I wonder what Tom's doing here.
You're not omnipotent.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom's got some questions.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand bit a wall.
So I didn't have to hide.
He's coming out of his home soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.

Have you seen anyone in the park?
Did I not warn you that you should not go there?

He's more or less aware of his problems.
Tom said he saw the NFO.
I know who you were with.
Tom has a bicycle?
What did you ask them?
It's a good repair.
I have breakfast every morning.

Are you in trouble with the car?
At the tourist information centre, the city map was made available to everyone.

I tried hard.
That's a good sign.
Some are convinced that they are protected by a guardian angel.
Tom's devastated his bank account.
She's at the hotel now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid his attention to it.
I told him I wasn't interested in that.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you couldn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is stronger, money stronger.
I saw him naked.
There's a lot of books in our library for children.
I didn't let her go home early.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't want to hinder you.

Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he couldn't hold back from starting to sing.
When will this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
It's a spot that left a mark on the skirt.
Is Tom dating someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you're back, I'm gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped dating him.

I thought you hated us.
Think nicely before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it for a joke and didn't answer it.
Actually, his name wasn't Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
Don't do what you're gonna regret.
Are you jealous of her?
I hope I can stay here for a while.
Payment will be made on the basis of experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.

I decided I wouldn't stay.
We look forward to you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?

There are no exceptions to the esperanto.
If you need help, tell me.
Can I go home early today?

There's a trade area nearby.
Mary thinks she's the smartest one.
Use your fist.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
These are interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drunk.
We don't even know her.
Tom came up with a few suggestions and checked them for Mary before he poured it on Tatoeba.
I know where you're hiding your money.
Finally, the school ended.
It's a long pencil.
Does your mother know that?
Do you really like this kind of food?
Tom looked in the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The caffeine's empty.
Write a pencil, please.
We can't leave.
He confessed to his crime.
It's the best picture I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's got something to worry about.
At times Claudia was thinking about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never have agreed.
You need to find a job.
He'll be back late tonight, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half the third.
Don't leave a tape on the sun.

I'm surprised you remember them.

Can I open the curtain?
You had no right to do that.
I'm yours.
He blew up just as much as he drank.

Come in.
I'll take care of them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will split up.
How's Tom doing?
Tom says he never did that.
Tom, it seems like a nice man.

I had to get through the fence.
The fires couldn't hold the flames.
Help finally came.
It's a horse.

I had no idea you could do that.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew something that John didn't know about Mary.
No answer.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I shook my head negatively.
Tom, you're called.
You promised you wouldn't drink tonight.
Is everything ready tomorrow?
We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think it works like that.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you coming tomorrow?
A hole lizard.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I have to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up and she's gone.
We've got a lot of food today.

I have nothing to tell you.
I'd prefer you not to tell Tom.
I still didn't want to go.
I'm not gonna complain.
They kept their love secret.
She hastened at the station only then to be late for the train.
Don't say that to my fiancée.

I urge you to reconsider your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.

Although I felt that there was something weird, I didn't know what it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you accept me as I am?
Bear black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who's going to be in the congregation.
It's hard to come to the President.
If she's hungry, you'll eat.
I was awfully scared.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll take care of it immediately.
I don't trust her.
The six three is eighteen.
“Scala” is an anagram of “Love”.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.

That's what I found in the cave.
I think I impressed him.
The train's going to be in this station for about two minutes.

She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom escape?
Tom doesn't know how Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told them not to do this.
Two days ago, I picked up a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do that.
Let's have some coffee in that cafeteria or something.

Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're insane.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
Excuse me, could you repeat the question?
What do you think they're gonna do with Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary's gonna do it.
Nobody wants to.
Tom's going to work on these weekends.
Tell her, please, I called.
Nobody could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
Attempts by the President to implement more strict arms control once and for a time were suppressed by influential weapons lobby.

We need to talk to her.
You have enough time.
We should have planned more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud my father's a good cook.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

That's why there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on the bus.
Tom wants to try a new champagne.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay forward.
You made coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.

We both speak French.
I want you to find a nice suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're sick for Spartak!
That's how he showed up his triumph.
Why was Tom needed?
It's an investment of capital.
It's really bitter.
There was no time to do that.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it for good.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's thanks to you.
As long as certain conditions are met.
She's not like everyone.
Social networks provide a lot of information about the person before meeting him.
What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What is the point of learning?
These peaches aren't very sweet.
I don't think these ink spots can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay you.
I can't forgive his lazy.
Tell me you're kidding me!
I'm a realist.

You can't always win.
Tom is something like celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The picture hangs on the wall.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom and you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
I've prepared for that dinner.
Russia has become a second super-Power.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to mail to send a letter.
Have this powder in a cup of water.
Are you coming with her?
Let's take one of those ready lunchs that are sold at the station.
Tom was trying to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go abroad?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How did it happen that you knew each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop the guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent for the Manhattan apartment is about four thousand dollars a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only survivor.
Are you going to buy this car?
You say like my grandmother.
I don't have my own brothers.
Let's see something else.
You think it's accurate?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to do.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You really helped.
Don't knock your hand in the door.
You have to take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
Did you know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to go on.
Tom and Mary stopped kissing.
We're going to dinner on Friday.
What's your dad's name?
Can't you turn off the radio?
I definitely don't remember what Tom said.
Tom is a skillful player.
I wasn't ready for that.
Look at that girl.
Tom's got a live imagination.
He's got broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday, you left the bar just at the moment I was going to put everyone in my bill.
Tom told me it was really working.
I want to play chess.
I'm supporting you at a hundred percent.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her what you're feeling.
I'm in a light headache.
I heard about what happened.
We rarely have snow here.
Don't open this box.
I hate waiting.
I sometimes see him at the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.
It was fun yesterday.
Where did Tom get these pictures?
Panic is useless.
Hey, you know what?
I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him off his feet.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage your money.
How does one relate to another?
I was able to do it much faster than Tom.
Don't feed the trolls.
Where was Tom sleeping?
I won't tell you.
Why are you still here?
Equator divides the ground into two hemispheres.
He's a landed man.
I've never seen anything like that.
Trees give a shadow.
She was picked up with a polish.
Tom doesn't know where it is.
Tom doesn't know where Mary works.
I agreed with Tom.
I have so much to say.
The answer is yes.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tell me your new address.
Do you see me from there?
He told me.

This magazine is a good sale.
Her clothes attracted a lot of attention at the party.
They're gonna get married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They pulled lots to whom they should go first.

He has one purpose in life to earn money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
A letter to you.

What are you doing in my room?
We're terribly missing that.

So it was scary?
Tom invited me to stay for the night.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd really like you to stay.
I am impressed by your French.
We both want to do that.
If the ice warms, it grows.
We could have done it.
The doctor said that he needed surgery.
I've recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom's realistic.
Who knocks on my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I've come to visit you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team returned home with a triumph.
I left alone.
Tom married a senior girl.
I listened to him.
Why don't you sleep?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take us a picture?
I heard you crying.
Show me how to do this!
Everyone's silent.
Let the dust lie down.
Why are you so dead?
He invaded his Chinese teacher, but with all these hormones, he got involved in almost every meeting.
I'm glad to let you know that I'm completely cured.
I've written a lot of suggestions on the esperanto.
Aquarel I like more than a pastor.
I can't make exceptions.
He's quick to think.
I can find them.
I'm here right now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to TV.
I'm almost my head every day.
To my surprise, he didn't pay the bill.
Did you steal it?
She must be angry with me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes fishing like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom's speaking French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better cooking than I do.
He's swimming like an ax.
Tom didn't tell Mary he needed to buy.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry up." "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We've already faced this problem.
I'll try to say that French.
I'm not like everything else.
I managed to get two tickets for a concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful automobile business.
She's in sunscreens.
Come on, Emily, your father is waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus by negative gives plus.
In the basement.
Please donate.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're great.
I spent the weekend with my friends.
Jane's forgiving speech made us very sad.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look embarrassing.
I am grateful for the help.
He couldn't hold back his smile.
Wait, did you say "woman" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before you made her pregnant.
Tom says he doesn't marry Mary.
I caught two fishes.
I think Tom is sick.
Tom grinded.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hadson is my father's friend.
Can I come, too?
Does Tom make enough money to live in town?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed unsure of his answers.
I heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There are so many.
He could not compromise his principles.
Mary says she's lonely.
You must have three hours for this.
It was a simple solution.
Mary said she's coming early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
It can be everyone.
There's never enough one language.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about a party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom's a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom to sing at our wedding.
That's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with my mind.
Tom keeps his room clean.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one subject to the other.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's in.
It's not cold today.
I missed Tom's shirt.
Looks like the bank's robbery was planned up to a little bit.
That's why he didn't like it, but he still bought it.
Just stay a little.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank's empty.
Why didn't you show her Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take the phone off.
Can you tell us what this is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, isn't he?
Don't force me to kill you!
How much more do you like?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't be mad at us.
You can't answer that.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did this for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
Do you really want me to tell him that you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it?
The whole people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous this is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, all right, listen, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom's my friend.
While counting to remain ignorant and free, the nation counts on things that have never been or will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't distinguish colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than a bad company.
That's the wrong data.
There is a significant difference between them.
I know that some of you think Tom is lazy.
I need to tell him not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's making a look.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
That's why Mary should be told the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She always complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
At that moment, I fell in love with that language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order this pizza?
I need you to help me with that.
Tom is my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You didn't have to go to the forest alone.
Nobody sees my tears.
Tom's been asleep again.
She likes you very much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multiple.
Tom never kissed anyone yet.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to dive when she was five years old.
We complained to the noise manager at the neighbors.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honestness is one of the virtuous.
As you meet a new year, you'll spend it.
There's no book in French in the library.
Every synthesis is dangerous, especially so.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write that hyragani, please?
We don't think it matters.
Nobody understands you the way I do.
Be aged accordingly.
You know how to jungle?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they wouldn't come.
I don't overwhelm animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's gonna stop tonight.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of turmoil.
The conference room's busy now.
Potato chips are harmful to your health.
Mys is not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's down here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You've been talking to yourself so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
That's always the case.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken to orbit.
I'm absolutely serious.
Are you sure you're sick?
It's too simple.
What will happen to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I'm very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about that.
Tom didn't tell us why he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account must be paid to the first number of the next month.
My French is horrible.
We need help.
You scare her.
For me, Boston is a cold town, not that Chicago.
Tom was a victim of attempted extortion.
I can't speak for colleagues.
Is Tom far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The fight ended.
You can check your pockets.
Tom came yesterday.
I'd like to keep an account.
You chose the wrong man.
They risked a lot.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If someone can do that, Tom.
The meeting was canceled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a cart with mules on the road.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents and his parents English.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
Everybody dance!
I live with Tom.
Here I met them.
You don't waste time.
Your problem is you lack patience.
Several events marked the coming of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing that, Tom.
Tom said he didn't plan to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said that there was no way to talk about it.
He got out of bed.
The trains are followed according to the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it is impossible to avoid confusion in languages.
Why does Tom avoid me?
Is there an exam tonight?
What motivates you?
Lila gave her her her computer.
Get your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say that in America anyone can become president, but that's probably not true.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first one on the list is Tom's name.
What else did you miss?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the train coming?
How long is this train coming to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
You need me to call.
Tom never thought Mary and John were dating each other.
When I am rich, I'll buy a farm.
I screwed him with cookies.
It's a neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to meditate.
Translate it to French, please.
Take the cold steel away!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
That's Tom told me about what happened.
Kosi and kill me.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom's got a weak heart.
That's why we're gonna have to pay for her.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix her.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I'm finally able to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is thirteen?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's dressed in a white cotton-made shirt.
It's the tower.
I'll have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Is there anyone here who knows them?
They're watching you.
How long do you want?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary's dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of broad avenues in this city.
What are you carrying?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than I am.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She has a double chin.
We can't force people to do that.
Let me get it.
I think it's Tom's guilty.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her come in.
Our neighbors complained.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has a weakness.
I wonder why that's why.
I think it's suspicious.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one here from Boston.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter is about to end.
The titles and the rewards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting's prolonged.
I'll find out.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
Don't you want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
Don't you remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring him a drink.
What do you want to eat on these weekends?
Get together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled to me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You had to apologize to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxist when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not gonna buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
It received the highest grades.
Tom might be freaking out.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do that.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a cocktailed dom.
I'd like to lie down.
Get me some note papers or something like that.
I want to relax in front of TV this night, I don't want to get out of the house.
He'll be here tonight.
Cat's dead.
It's only half nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I wouldn't mind if you smoked.
This lake is unsafe.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put her hands on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you were back.
My car is covered with pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make this mistake any more.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to marry him.
I've been waiting for my whole life this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the test?
The plane entered the airport.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary lost her mind.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Are you going to a concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd like to see you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your probes?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hi," sillyly said Tom.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in pain.
She didn't have food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the pricing.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
The new proposal as a message in a bottle will ever be transferred.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everybody loved you.
We're relatives with him.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She started studying in her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do this yesterday.
It's a few early drinks, isn't it?
My parents don't like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him awkwardly and hardly.
Because, worse?
It's not worth it.
Can I take you for a hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about the target.
We have to start watching the seasons off!
Road accidents take place daily.
Where did you go slippering?
You've been to the gigmaker?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the balloon pen.
The only way to know what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do that?
Let's all take a picture.
I failed in the examination.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
Footballist made a huge mistake.
Will they come, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brake.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hung up.
That's my cat.
Do you have any children?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-reliant idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I suppose you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks that throwing out is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is bending right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has made a lot better.
Let's go to church.
Tom squirrel.
Was it hard?
He responds.
I didn't see him any more.
How much did he cost?
I need to see you immediately.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about that.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The stolen squirrel will also steal a cow.
Tom's not a good swimmer, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of himself.
How do we do this?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Anything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give him another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I must stay together.
I heard only good about him.
I'm not working here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare with us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Placing.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV broadcast?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's case is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like going to school.
I offered help.
I'll be back to Canada tomorrow.
Thank me for your son.
I think her father is a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog's yours.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to come home tonight.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer instilled courage in his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like that.
I don't really know how to hunt.
For the first time, I'm cooking home grill meat.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many probes do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It's already been known to everyone.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I bounce every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's a sour apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalogue.
It must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Do you take work for home?
According to mythology, Prometheus abducted a sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers were able to get out of the bus before he ignited.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking cheques.
My bike's gone.
The stars were shining in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Eh, here you have so boring." -- "Oh, my boy, to this world, all are trying to do it -- "Here and me, your Majesty, Henon and his servants have taken the island of Coridai." -- "Hm-hmm. What can we do..." -- "How is it written, only Link can conquer Genon." -- "So we can." -- "Wow, I'm going to catch my sword!" -- "Mecha no." -- "Metha" -- "No" -- "May no!" -- "Oh, how do you think this gun is?
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you on Sunday at three.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're good at it.
I met her on her way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm going to that house.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.
Tom helped Mary lay the blankets.
A is a multitude consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by nine.
He's got diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I just wondered if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
That's what I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
I want to swim in the sea.
It's going to be completely dependent on him.
I met a classmate.
He's grown up enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was swallowed with a power.
Nobody saw them come out of the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music are you usually listening to?
There's no food without bread.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
You had to quit smoking for a long time.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates are full of boring, and they don't know anything about computers.
Did you like the bicycle?
I thought Tom wasn't asleep.
So they were not allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom's waiting.
Listen to what the teacher says.
She's amazingly like Marylyn Monroe.
I know who we can turn for help.
I'm stronger than you are.
She was deeply regretted by looking back on her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.
Tom and I nodded.
In politics it is difficult to earn respect, but it is easy to lose.
Stop acting like a child!
Let's go.
They're beginning to believe their own lie.
Don't raise him.
Tom wants to paint his hair.
I've never seen her here before.
Why should I work with Tom?

I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She went out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medication?
The bastards are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time's on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bouling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of green rubber?
This isn't what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom stretched Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's gonna try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's dead.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The fighter is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it working.
Vermont is at the border with Canada.
He had to live in one room with a brother.
I'm not imbecile.
You're gonna fix it, right?
I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you don't have to do that.
I invite you to let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromidewater acid?
We've got a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
That's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
Neboscrub is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him to the sweater.
I don't think Tom would want to come with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, is it cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning to stay?
We ate hurriedly, and we left immediately.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal from the soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat in front of me.
The cafeteria was open.
I've brought my fault.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to see you before I die.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
Did you know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
Is she singing?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go in the car.
You're bothering me.
She wondered what his lips would taste.
A good coach trainer trains this team.
The tree's sick.
The train was arrested because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left my hat in the room.
Is this the drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You won't recognize her?
I didn't ask Tom to do that or not.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
On the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are on your street?
Elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "Men Tom's name."
Her native language is French.
It's a wool.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naivety is its only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
Tom was a child living in Boston.
I didn't eat six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very friendly, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under cradle.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Excuse me for upsetting you.
The one who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned my imagination on.
I thought we could do that.
My mom didn't want me to drive alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You don't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're peers with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had those symptoms?
Prisoner's released.
What did they say?
Could you leave the door open?
It's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice as old as I am.
Tom knows that what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check it again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, I was almost noon.
Tom's only pretending to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your view of taxes.
Tom's watching.
We can open the windows again.
There's never been one with me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna get out when I called the phone.
I don't have to tolerate it.
Always step aside the way to the right.
We're asked to be in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasted her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing is so relaxing as a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
The book is on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic siren song for me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers left a print on the glass.
Chemistry is great science.
I feel like my French doesn't get any better.
How can I get my passport best?
Perhaps you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
Outside is still light.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but it'll be mine soon.
You forgot his name?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
A big Thomas?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how I was busy?
Tom pretended he was busy.
I don't have to trust anyone.
She's a worshiper of Sex in a big city.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Get a good look at him.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing is like a glass of beer after a long day of work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will you need?
Let's rest here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She cut off the rumas when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.

Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What kind of house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive a car.
So you don't like the end of the film.
Just get in.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was lawful.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sang with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.

He came and kneeled.

No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it?
This tissue is coming to your skin.
I fell in love with you.

Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.

The situation's getting worse.
I'm picking out where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.

Don't give it to him.
Run, or you'll be arrested.

Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do that.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I don't give up disobedient children.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said was pissed off.
You're too small for that.

At the accent, I realized he was an American.

"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
So what's this, I'm wondering, if it's not a house sale, then maybe it's a new way to get acquainted with the girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you leave your room?
If God is not, it is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please strap the belts during the flight and the landing.
That was Tom and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've been waiting for it a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll have too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Have you built all of this yourself?
I'm looking forward to a summer vacation.
Can I make it different?
From here he looks great.
The village houses are easily ignited.
Let's start that party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very convenient.
I'll do a report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's tasty.
I want to listen to your side.
I'll wait for his coming here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I eat anything?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everyone's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a miserable guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.

What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to give in to emotion.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You're just saying obviously.
He had cancer.
You're the one to blame for it.
It's like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're catching everything on the fly.
Let's roll him up.
Let's leave it to tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing that.

I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in your own souls?
What's that noise?
My son has an inheritance disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is the attack.
That autumn she's getting married.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you with anything?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We went back through Boston.
Who would believe that?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's pushing his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bicycle.
I'm not talking to the TV at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed.
I spent 500 dollars a day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't make it.
Seventy-thirty now.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.
Tom got up early to see the dawn.
Dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually go up one step.

I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got everything out of my hands today.

Tom's only 30 years old to learn how to drive.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary were studying French.
I haven't laughed so long.
The knife was not sharp enough to cut meat, so I used my knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You're about to adjust to the village life.
Keep a bucket next to the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
The river is deeper than anything else.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you this a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Words separately when they are to be written in a slim way - a big problem in Norwegian.

Let's give him a chance.
I like the fruits.
Tom lied.
He's selling cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope he won't."

Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake here.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How's the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning beats twice in one place.
I'm not boasting.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.

Make your own decision.
You were surprised?

I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
Rabbits breed fast.
I don't want to talk about it now.
How much is the coat cleaning going to be?

I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonolulu.
You're not telling me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last.
Tom signed a petition.
Did you try to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know so much about Tom.
How's the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Would you like them to help?
Tom can't see anywhere.
That's what I told him to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
In the near future, we can meet again.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a grandma.
I slept on my belly.
Keep me informed.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two marks for forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think that's gonna make it good.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You kind of said she was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.

That's a long way to go.
Is that washing away?
