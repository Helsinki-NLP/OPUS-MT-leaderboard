The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with mappets”
Some CHA are terrified by the recommendation to change the title of their post to the “MWP Parliament of Wales”.
This recommendation was based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
WHERE of the entire political spectrum, it is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One CHA from the Laborists claimed that his group was worried about the rums of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in the Wales, "twp" means "undoubted" and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
CHAIRPERSON of the Wales Party stated that his group was generally “unsatisfied ” and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was “unbiased ” about changing the name, but noted that MWP could quickly become a“ mappet. ”
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation “w ” is similar to that of the English pronunciation “u. ”
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation for the change of titles, noted: “A sufficient decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves.”
The Wales Self - Control Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament was widely supported.
As to how to call CHA, the Commission proposes to call them "the members of the Parliament of Wales", that is, the WMP, but the MWP has received the greatest support from the public.
Of course, CHA offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause problems for head of Eline Jones, who is supposed to Billing Changes for a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the Assembly, including the rules for disengagement of the CHA and the structure of the committee system.
THE CHAIRPERSON will hold a final vote on its new name when discussing legislation.
The Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum to change the country name
On Sunday, the voters vote on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
Voting was organized to resolve a multi-year controversy with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens have long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim in Greece, and repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, George Johnov, who opposed the referendum on the change of title, stated that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that change of name is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Marten's phones keep quiet because the Churches of Harlem are in difficult times.
“Old people I was talking to say that before there was a bar and a church in every corner,” relates Mr. Adams.
Now there's no one else."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood as:
“Now people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local living room to which they come regularly.”
With regard to churches, Adams fears that money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “before or later they will end up where they started. ”
He added that the churches could replace condominium buildings, and there would be people who would not help the shrines that remained nearby.
“ The vast majority of people buying condominiums in these buildings will be white, ” explained Adams, “so this will accelerate the day when all these churches will be closed, for most of those who move to condominiums are unlikely to be their companions. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Marten was built ten years after it.
The Korean White Methodist Community left in the 1930s.
A black community conducting rituals nearby had the right to own a building.
Saint Martén went to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of the distributive merchants on the 125th street, Harlem's main trading street, and these merchants didn't want to accept blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set it up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martén, proudly called a carillon “the vermin of the poor”.
An expert who played a carillion in July called it a “cultural treasure” and a“indispensable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first in the world to play the black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who moved 18 years ago to a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, in St. Martén, he had no replacements.
What's happening in Saint Marten over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which were involved by the leaders of the church, others by the bishops.
The Council, the governing body of the parish, made up of peace leaders, wrote the eparchies in July that it was concerned that the eparchy would “try out” to the council, but that the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the bishop.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Acula traumatized a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California.
According to official officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and traumatized him, and the boy was diving for lobsters in California on the day he opened the lobster season.
The attack took place almost at 7: 00 a.m. at the beach of Bikon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with a group sailed to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought that it was just a fascination about a caught lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting: “I have bitten!
I was bitten!"
As soon as he got to the boy, he found that his key was completely broken.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, "A shark in the water!"," he added.
The boy was taken to the Council Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The view of the shark that attacked is unknown.
The captain of Larry Jails on the media Briefing said that a few weeks ago, the shark was noticed in this area, but it was determined that it did not refer to dangerous shark species.
Jayles added that the victim had been injured by traumatic damage to the upper part of the torso.
In an investigation and security effort, the authorities closed 48 hours of access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casablad to Saami in Encinitas.
Jayles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to get to the British market of cosmetics.
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using cosmetics islands like those in the universers.
In the context of the increased entry into the British cosmetics market of £2.8 billion (to continue to increase at the time the sales of clothing and household goods are going down) the increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 shops throughout the country, and next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other shops.
Investing in cosmetics is because supermarkets are looking for ways to use the policy space that had been used under television, microwave furnaces and household goods.
In Sainsbury's it was stated that they would double the assortimation of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including the first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing L'Oreal, maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: they're going to be brand zones like those in Boots shops.
Supermarket also updates the assortimation of Boutique cosmetics: Now most of the items presented will not be protested against animals that are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrence Shop's retailer protests his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second will be opened in Salie Oak, Burmingham, later this year.
The Internet screening and going to buy small foods every day in small shops makes supermarkets do extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coupt, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like umbrella, because the supermarket network is trying to resist the Aldi and Lidl discounters using more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's are opening the Argos branches in hundreds of their shops, and there's also a number of Habitats divisions, and Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and argues that it has increased sales of food products, and it has made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to upgrade cosmetics and pharmaceutical products to the supermarket was a failure.
Sainsbury's were testing Boots' cooperation in the early 2000s, but it ended after a controversy about how to divide the income from the pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold his pharm business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended luxury brand to the luxury, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more enjoyable for customers.
We also invested in specially trained counselors to provide advice.
The brands that we've presented are called to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and comfortable locations mean that we're now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition for an old way of buying."
Peter Jones “retreated” because Holly Willowby came out of an agreement worth £11 million.
The dragon League Star, Peter Jones “retreated” because the Television Leader Holly Willowby came out of the contract with his brand of goods for life (the contract value is £11 million) to focus on new Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts
Willowbi doesn't have time for the brand of home dress and appetite Truly.
The business of the couple was connected to the brand of Goop Guinet Peltrow.
The 37-year-old leader of this Morning announced her entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones' Legvo Dragon star to the tales when, at the last moment, they got out of their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on new convenience contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is "retreated" when a golden girl from the TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones' headquarters in Marlou, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts with a value of 1.5 million pounds sterlings mean that she no longer has enough time to devote it to their joint brand of home clothing and to the shares of Truly.
This business was linked to the brand of Goop Guinet Peltrow and was to double the wealth of Willowby, which is estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowby reported to Instagram coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest buildings.
The source said: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s main priority.
He was to be her long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to get out of business shocked all the interests.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a full storehouse ready for sale.
Experts believe that leading This Morning, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could cost the firm millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and homely clothing) and create further delays to start.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of the three children, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Boldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willowby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
Couples held feasts together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the Boldoin TV shares.
Willowby will be a brand of M&S and replace Anthony McParlin as leader I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
A hard conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider “non-President” and for a very positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
“ Why did President Trump make such a big move? ”
said the Trump, simulating the voice of the news evangelizer. —
I didn't make any mistakes."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore a major step toward the denucleication of North Korea.
But the denucleicization talks went into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat in North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsible response” from the United States to its first disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to maintain pressure.
The Tramp was much more optimistic when he gave a talk at his rally.
“We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would have been killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile trials, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American military personnel home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about Kim’s relationships.
“It is so easy to behave in Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the streets trying to get into this battle of the stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” said Temp, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island of hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombo, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok people were affected, the national catastrophe was not declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although “Save the Children” is collecting a team to travel to Pala until it is not known whether foreign staff can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster management agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Pala to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami reservoirs have been built, but they are not unique to other coasts.
The apparent absence of a rawn warning about the tsunami in Pala, although warnings were likely conducive to death.
To move between the vast majority of Indonesian islands is not just the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The medical ship in Lombock to treat earthquake victims sails to Pala, but it can reach the site of the new catastrophe at least three days later.
President Joco Widodo made the infrastructure of Indonesia the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the funding deficit created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, who planned to re-engineer in the next year.
Mr. Joko is also hindered by the long interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia, where Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of opposition to Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machete, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's Statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by "Repeat of History"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts in England, which his fanatical patriarchs carried out.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Creek's offer “indulgence” and“ attempts to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmite, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, the fact that the Oliver Cromwell statue at Westminster Palace was inevitable.”
Economy during English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell or by his command.
Cromwell is likely to be undeservedly offered as a sacrifice for his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of the Cromwell of the sculptor William Hamo Thorneukroft is a testimony to the moods of the 19th century and a part of the history of the figure that many still believe is worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmouth told The Sunday Telegraph: "Most likely more than at the end of the 19th century than now considers Cromwell to protect Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Whether such an idea is accurate is the subject of the historical debate that persists.
There's no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the prominent figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievements as the Lord of the Protector should also be celebrated and respected."
The killer pig destroyed a Chinese farmer until he died.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in the market in southwest China.
A man identified only by Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig in the market in Liupanshui, Guichhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Blue, China, in the Tsinhai Province, on May 30, 2005, the pig is going to vaccinate pigs in the pig.
It is reported that on Wednesday, he left with his cousin in the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw the door of the pig open.
The brother pointed out that there was a big bone in the pig with blood on the mouth.
Judicial medical expert confirmed that 249 kilograms of cab had destroyed the farmer to death.
“ My cousin’s legs were bloody and distorted, ” stated a cousin of a victim named Wu, quoted by Guyang Evening News.

You just have to treat them with due respect," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was projected to deteriorate by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the nearest days of Rosa, it's going to bring rain with vegetation to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
The Rose had a wind of 137 kilometres per hour (this is Hurricane Category 1) by a state of 5 in the east on Sunday and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Evgenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, a moisture that moves east to the west coast of the United States begins to form, and on Monday, when Rosa approaches the lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it will start to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rain to about 25.4 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the nearest days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the nearby coat, will produce strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous rain floods, leaks, and potential drifting in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will result in an increase in precipitation by 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in the mainland of Arizona.
Flood floods are possible when conditions deteriorate rapidly because of the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
It is advisable not to go to the desert on foot, for tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons storming rivers, and thunderstorms can bring down ripe winds and dust storms.
The approach of the taxes will cause high rains in some parts of California’s northern coast.
The number of rainfall may exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause unpowerful streams of garbage and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainy rain in the region.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will be wider.
The heavy rain will go over Thor Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but tropics remain quite warm.
At times, this leads to a sharp change in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, we will see an excellent example of a sharp temperature change in the central United States.
It's almost a 7-grade difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and DeMonnes, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that the central and eastern parts of the United States will be warm until October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Fahrenheit [27 ° C.].
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability of surpassing average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching the Brettt Kavano case
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six television networks were watching the stirring testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which was allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted scheduled programs to report the last news of Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into the charge.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent confident that Kavano had polished her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a party at high school.
Cavano, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent confident that this was not the case.
It's probably over 20.4 million people were watching this on Friday, and the research company Nielsen reported it.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
You couldn't get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in their offices.
For a comparison, this audience is the size of a audience that watches the play-off series or the Oscar award.
Fox News Channel, whose leading thought show strongly supported Kavano's assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the hearing that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million audiences, observed in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million spectators, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The office of this modest republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavano, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS captured the protesters shouting at Flake when he tried to go to an elevator to hear the Judgment Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was lied, which was broadcast in a straight air on the CNN.
“ I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have authority, and a multitude of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement and had added that he would say more to the committee before closing the elevator.
All cables and broad - speaking channels were broadcast for hours later, when the Judicial Committee was to vote on the nomination of Kavano to vote in the full Senate.
Flake said he'd do it only if he knew that the FBI was a charge against the candidate next week, which demanded a democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced to talk to his friend, the democrat senator Chris Cunns.
After talking to Kunes and then with several Senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice was influential, since it was evident that the Republicans would not have votes to assign a candidate to Cavano without investigation.
President Trump initiated a FBI investigation of charges against Kavano.

Volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The dust that is thrown out of the Popokatepetl volcano has reached the southern parts of the capital city of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Warning Centre encouraged Mexicans to keep away from the volcano because the crater began to act and recorded 183 gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center tracked many noises and pushes.
The picture in social networks shows the thin layers of ashes on the lobby of cars in the areas of Mexico City, such as Hodimilko.
Geophysics observed an increase in volcanic activity, located 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 points in central Mexico in September 2017.

The police faced the catalonic separatists prior to the election anniversary for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the protesters who are in charge of independence faced a special police unit. Thousands of people joined the protesters' demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on the separation.
The proseparatist group, in masks held by specialists, threw them with eggs and powdered paint that created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The skirts took place and later on that day, the police used the sticks to restrain aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence advocates who scanded “Don't forget, we won't forgive!” faced the conservationists of the country who shouted, “Let Spain live! ”
According to the local press, fourteen people were assisted in the light - trauma of protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid was declared illegal but celebrated by the Catalan separatists, the tension in the region that seeks independence remains high.
The voters generally decided to vote for independence, but the appearance was low, since most opposers boycotted votes.
According to the Catalonian authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent collisions in the past year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at electoral stations throughout the region.
The independence teams spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations to support the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to go another route.
Narcys Termes, an electrician who participated in a separatist protest with his wife, claimed that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“ Last year we have experienced one of our best points.
I watched my parents cry for the joy that they can vote, but now we're in the deaf corner, ” he said.
Notwithstanding the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties that are acting for independence were unable to preserve the impulse this year, because many of their most well-known leaders are in voluntarily exile or imprisoned in anticipation of trial for their participation in the referendum and the further proclamation of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested police support for the phone, claimed that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“The stress is getting stronger, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunnkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in the following isolator from the end of last year, announced that the next year he would be balancing to the European Parliament.
“The status of the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men were arrested after the car went into the house.
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car had entered the Londoner house several times.
The incident was at the Ballinoward Crosscent at 19:30 in the British Standard Time.
Detective inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It may well be that at some point, the car was fired from the shell.
Udar Menga provided Livingston with a victory over Reingers, with an account 1-0
The first leg of the Dolly Menga in Livingstone became the winner
The exaggerated Livengston class staggered Reingers and brought Stephen Jerard a second defeat of 18 games as an Abrox club manager.
The Dolly Menga's blow proved to be decisive: Gary Holt's team went up one level in a second from Hibernian.
Gerard's team won't win the premiere lease of this season, and the next Sunday is playing with the Harts leaders from which it stands to eight points.
Before that, Thursday, Greengers, will accept Rapid Vienna as part of the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its invincible move to six games in the Division, and the chief coach Hall has not yet been defeated after Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Livingstone misses the chances of improper guests.
The Hallt team was supposed to be ahead long before they were killed, for their outrightness creates a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson burst through defence, but struck along the gate, then Alan Litgous struck past the gate after he woke up and took a stab of Craig Halkette along the gate, which he made his head.
The hosts were pleased that they allowed Reingers to play in front of them, and they knew they could cause problems to visitors from standard positions.
So the crucial naked was killed.
Reingers missed a free blow, and Livingstone made discoveries, Declan Gallaher and Robinson engaged in Mengu, who took the ball and killed the penal centre.
Before that stage, Reingers was dominated by a ball, but the protection of the owners of the field proved to be improper, and Liam Kelly’s gateway was largely not disturbed.
This trend continued in a second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's blow-up to the Halkper Reingers legs, Allan McGregor, and Litgous hit the gateway in another standard Livingston combination.
The Navises were constantly on the line in Livingston’s fine, and they were constantly neutralized, and two applications on the toolbar — after the Halkette attack on Glenn Middlton, which was replaced, and the hand — were rejected.
Livingstone Phenoman: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of Scotland at the Tony Macaron Aren Stadium
The Fenomanal Game and Liveingston.
All to one differently played, they continued to exceed the expectations of this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition hasn't changed dramatically after returning to the highest level, but it's necessary to pay back Hall for mobilizing the team after it came.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkette played hugely, was very well organized, and Manga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep watch.
Reingers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they don't have much to do with those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- just once they broke off the defense of the masters of the field -- and it was something like a wake-up for the Reingers, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was recognised in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of the conflicting visit of President Erdogan to Germany to restore relations between NATO's allies.
There were some controversy between them on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press, and the European Union’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Kelly to open a huge new mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police didn't give 25,000 people to meet in front of the mosque, but a lot of the President's supporters still appeared near to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — also forced themselves to hear them, condemning Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
Two - sided protests indicate the ambiguity of a visitor, whom some German Turks called hero and others dictator.
Road accident in Depford: A bicycler died in a collision with a car
The bicycle died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the Bescud Street crossing and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the southeast of town at about 10:15 a.m. in the British standard time.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics came to the site, but the man died.
This accident took place a few months after another cyclist died after the ride of the driver's accident to the Chailders Street, about 1.6 kilometres of the Saturday accident.
The London Police stated that it was working to set up a man to inform his closest relatives.
Travel is banned and bus routes have been changed, and motorists are encouraged to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: six prisoners are traumatized in turmoil.
Six inmates were injured as a result of violent violence in a male prison, and the prison administration reported.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin in Woostershire started about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday afternoons.
To halt the turmoil initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special subsection called Tornado was called.
The officers were provided with medical care in connection with the light face trauma of the event.
A prison officer commented: “In solving the incident in the prison of Her Majesty Long-Lartin, a specially trained prison staff was involved.
Six co-workers received medical treatment in connection with trauma.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsible will be sent to the police and their term of detention may be extended."
In her Majesty's prison, Long-Lartin is over 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
It was reported in June that the prison chief was sent to permanent treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, the police officers were called into prison to stop serious violence, where the prisoners were attacked with the ballard layers.
The Rosa hurricane threatens Phoenixo, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with leaky veins.
Tropical depression rarely strikes on Arizona, but this can happen early in the following week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading southwest of the desert, creating the risk of rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from western Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaf, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be raining.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the border of Arizona.
According to the recent projections of the National Hurricane Center, in the Moglollon-Rim area in Arizona, it is projected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and by places to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Big Basin, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, places maybe up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of rain floods, Rase’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful because south-west is now experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, a little over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts in the Mexican Peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour, is 620 kilometres south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19.3 kilometres per hour.
Storm meets with more cool water in the Pacific and thus deteriorates.
Thus, it is expected that the day or evening of the tropical storm will cause a turmoil in Mexico.
The precipitation rate in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“It is expected that the total rainfall from the Lower California to the northwestern Sonora will be from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, places to 25.4 cm,” reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arison border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and will reach South Uta late in the evening.
“The fundamental danger expected of Rosa or its remains is the strong rains in Lower California, the northwestern Sonora, and the southwest of the American desert, ” reports the National Hurricane Centre.
It is expected that these rains will lead to damaging floods and garbage streams in the deserts, as well as downturn in the mountainous region.
Midsomer-Norton attack: arrested four people who attacked the murder.
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested for suspicion of attempting to kill after they found a 16-year-old boy with knives.
A wounded teenager was found in the Ecelsior-Terras area in Midsomer Norton at about 04:00 on Saturday, British Standard Time.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock district, and the police told Evon and Samerset.
The police are asking to respond to all who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
The trump says that Kavano has endured vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and indignant tactics of the Democratic Party,” said the Trump at the Wingu, West Virginia.
The trump said that Kavano was “suffering disgustingness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire extinguishing process.
Kavano witnessed to Congress on Thursday, violently and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's accusation that he had committed sexual violence on her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness in the hearing on the charges she had made.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliantness, character and courage ” of the Kavano.
“The Voice for Judge Kavano is a voice for one of the most successful lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an incredible experience in the public service, ” he said to a crowd of adherents in Western Virginia.
The president made a steady mention of the eruption of Kavano when he talked about the importance of the Republican appearance in the middle-line elections.
“ In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
The trump claimed that the mission of democrats was to “oppose and hinder”.
It is expected that the first key procedural ballot in the Senate about the candidature of Kavano will take place not later than Friday, and CNN's assistant to one of the leaders of the Republican.
Hundreds were killed by earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number of victims increased
At least 384 people died, many fell into the ocean when the giant waves swept on the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawis declared the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested on a beach festival in Pala on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the twilight smashed off the shore, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami took place after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still engaged in their affairs on the beach and did not immediately begin to flee, and they were victims,” stated the Briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Puurvo Nugroho, an Indonesian disaster management agency (BNPB).
“It was not just tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit all that was on the land,” said Nugrojo, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed into trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerophotosis published by the disaster management agency reveals that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges are turned and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The mails in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of a severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times larger than the atomic bomb dumped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographic position at the end of the long, narrow covet could help the tsunami force was stated by the agency.
Nugroho described the damage as “wide-scale” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the debris of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho observed that victims and damages could be more than 300 kilometres (190 miles) along the coast line north of Pala, in the Dongal area near the earthquake’s epicenter.
“ Lines of communication were completely damaged, and we received no information from Donghal, ” said Nugroho.
There, more than 300,000 people live, reports the Red Cross, and adds that his staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“ It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pala, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
In the amatories that people shared in social networks, the man on the top of the house shouts violent warnings about the approach of the tsunami on the streets below the building.
After a few minutes, the water wall smashed into the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't immediately test the reality of the frames.
Earthquake and tsunami have caused a serious disengagement of electricity, which cuts the connection around Pala, which has made it difficult to coordinate rescue.
Military officials began shipping trucks with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reports the authorities, but evacuated people still need food and other essentials.
The airport of the city was opened only for help, and it would be closed until October.
President Joco Widodo was to visit evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of people killed by tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
The coworkers of World Vision from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in the tarnish tents set up in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doceba.
“ They told me they had seen many destroyed buildings, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams have taken decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the catastrophe, some complain that foreign humanitarian workers are not allowed to go to Pala.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a zone of national disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the province level, ” said Aulia Arriani, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Okay, this is a national catastrophe," we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
It's been the second night on Pala after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet been found were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers received a woman who lay under stone for two days along with her mother’s body.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national paraplaneterism team, trained two missing paraplanetists to participate in the Asian games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanters who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“ As an elder in paraplanerism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Hendon tells us that a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to a community of paraplaneters, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Pala's rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, his message was marked by only one gray gallop, not double blue.
"I think that means that the message has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling the bathroom in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a employee in Brink who used a bankrupt in Newport on the Levee, reports the New York Police Department news.
The car driver cleaned up a bankrupt in the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “called back to workmate Brink” and stole a bag of money intended to fill up.
The Witnesses noticed some suspects who fled the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reperer changes his name to Ye.
Reper Kanye West changes his name to Y.
On Saturday, declaring a change in Twitter, he wrote: “Rather is officially known as Kanye West. ”
41-year-old Uest was called Y, and he used this shortcut as a name for his June album.
The change took place in the day he appeared in Saturday Night Live, where he was expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaced Arian Grande’s singer, who canceled his participation for “emotional reasons, ” reported the author of the show.
It was not just a shortening of the current professional name, but before West had said that it had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanier, which means "elean," was reduced to just Y is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kaniye is one of a few famous ribers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deddy, P.Diddy and Dieddy, announced this year that he chose the name Lav and Braser Lav.
Former colleague of Westa, JAY-ZI, also experimented with defis and big letters.
The President of Mexico, Andrez Manuel Lopez Ombudsor promises not to use the army against civilians.
Andrez Manuel López Obrador, newly elected President of Mexico, promised never to use the army against the civilian, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of the students.
On Saturday, López Orador on the Tlatelolco Square promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, and left student movements were set up throughout Latin America.
Lopes Orador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to students and opening more free State universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal groups.
US should double financing in artificial intelligence
Since China's increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount they spend on research in this field, considers investor and practice in S.I.K.F. Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were given after the various parts of the U.S. government made applications for CHI, although there is no formal strategy in the United States.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: he wants to become 1 in the SEA by 2030.
“A double budget for research in SHI would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the area of CHI, ” said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next big accomplishment in the SI will be done in the United States, says Lee in an interview of CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book The Powers of the SI: China, the Sylicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the General Director of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he was working on the CHI system that played the best American player at Otello and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee celebrated previous technology competitions conducted by the U.S. government, such as Robotics Challenges of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research (DARPA) and asked when the following would be to help identify the future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win the state frontiers, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," he observed.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on CHI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the U.S. to increase efforts in SCI.
"I believe Green Cartage needs to be automatically offered to candidates of science in the SHI sphere," he said.
The Chinese State Council published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intellect of the New Generation in July 2017.
The Chinese National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for academics, just as the National Scientific Fund and other U.S. government organizations distribute money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defense established the Joint Center of Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve industry partners and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of the Special Committee of Artificial Intellect.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in AI Next.
In the case of the National Scientific Fund, he now invests over $100 million a year in research.
By the way, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create a Commission on Intellect’s National Security, has not taken any steps for a few months.
The Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the country name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a multi-year dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia from membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim for its territory, and vetoed the introduction of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments entered into an agreement based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opposers to the agreement argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote on a referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the voters would reach the minimum 50% that would allow the referendum to be valid.
The ballot paper asks: “Are you supporting NATO and the EU membership under the Greek agreement?”
Advocates for change in the name, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that were created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for the introduction to such organs as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the eagles of the European Union, because that means more secure life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Oliver Georgieevska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament stated that they would support it to make it decisive.
There will be two thirds of parliamentary votes to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of violations by the 13th Century.
However, the appearance was only 16% compared to 34% in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66% of the registered voters were thrown into the Urban Bulletin.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumika, Macedonia, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dusko, gave their voice to the referendum on a change in the country's name, which will open the way to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardkov was 54-year-old preparing a small scene and putting chairs in front of tents organized by those who would fight a referendum.
“We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly lifted head instead of a service door, ” said Kavardkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
The Prime Minister of the Zeiv believes that NATO membership will bring many needed investments to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said the Zayb after the vote.
He noted that the result of yes would be confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary phenomena.
According to another survey by the Telma Telecommunication Macedonia, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the phenomenon should be 50% plus one voice.
The defeat of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the western government since the beginning of its work last May.
See: Serhio Aguero, with Manchester City, walks through the Braitton Defense and kills the naked
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have been defended by Breiton and won Manchester City on Saturday 2-0 at the Ethiopian Stadium in Manchester, England.
Gol Aguero for the 65th minute of the match looked like a funny simple.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of sequence.
He ran between the three Breiton defenders and found himself in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He walked around one of the guards, then ran a few more on the edge of Bryton’s fine.
Then he made a pass on the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on a penal to give Aguero's ball, who, by his right shoe, put it into the right side of the gate by defeating the Breiton Halkper Matthew Ryan.
“ Aguera has some problems with the legs, ” said the journalists, Pep Guardiola, director of the City.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That was the case.
We're lucky that he's been hit by this moment."
But the initial advantage of the celestial blue in this Premier League match was that of Sterling.
That naked took place at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside the Braitton area.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass of Sterling in the direction of the far trouser.
Forward of the celestial blues threw the ball at the gate just before he crawled out.
The City will meet Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 Tuesday at the Rein Neckar Aren Stadium in Zingheim, Germany.
Sherker wants to pick up the glasses at Rockis.
Since Washington Navionals came out of the play-off, there was no significant reason to wait for another start.
But Sherzer, who is inclined to compete, hopes to go to the pitcher's mountain on Sunday, on a match against Corlorado Rockis, provided that Rokis will still have a problem with going out to the playoff. Now Rokis is playing one game ahead of Los Angeles Dogers in the National League of the West.
Rakis has at least a Wyld Card for the 5-2 winner on Friday evening, but they still want to secure the title of the first dividend.
"No matter what we're playing for, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers are acting here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've seen over the entire year.
Why don't I want to participate in this contest?
Oursionals will still be announced who will be the start-up pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to be Shercer.
The shirt for which it's going to be the 34rd start, four of them took pitching session and could play on Sunday, their typically outgoing.
Washington's right-hand side has a result of 18-7 of 2.53 ERAs and 300 of the 220,2/3 of the innang in this season.
Trampe Results in West Virginia
The President concurred on the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano when he spoke of the importance of the Republican adherents in the middle-line elections.
“ All we have done will be mapped in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important elections in our lives will be held.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm fighting for wonderful candidates wherever I can,” he said.
The trump continued: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see that this is happening now.
And they're firmly resolved to return power, using any means, you see the villain, the disgusting thing.
They don't care who suffers from them, who crosses them to get power and control, they want authority and control, we're not going to give them."
The Mission of Democrats, he said, “Continue against and to impede”.
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wicked and mean, disgusting and lying."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee, calling the Democrat Senator Diane Finstein by name, which triggered the audience to sound dissatisfaction.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you filed a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad corpse language -- the worst corpus language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist Party is no longer a broad church.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, that was almost unexpected.
After all, I'm the last of those members of Parliament who were told that they weren't happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my parliamentary colleague, was almost the same because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
I was sentenced to disagree with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, about national security, about Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the meeting of the Nottingham East Laborists on Friday says, "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local member of Parliament from the Laborists were the same.
Unfortunately, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more kinder, more soft” politicians has long been forgotten if they have ever started to do it at all.
It's increasingly obvious that in the Leiborist Party, there's no different viewpoint and every opinion is appreciated from the point of view of whether it's acceptable to lead the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom, as I used to think, I had similar political views, began to expect that I would turn up by 180 degrees and take positions that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU's only market.
Always when I speak publicly -- and it doesn't matter what I say -- followed by the tyrand of attacks in social networks, calling for revocation, condemning the policy of the center, I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Leiborist Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since commenting is usually political.
I am fascinated by professionalism and the determination of colleagues who face daily sexist or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Leiborist Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of "untrust" or a change of selection rules, the party is narrowing down.
During the past two years, I received many suggestions, and I was urged not to follow, not to speak so loudly, that “all things are good with me. ”
But I didn't get into politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago as a schoolmaker, because because of the lack of attention from the government, Tetcher, my class at high school was literally dissolved, since then I'm trying to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local adviser or the government minister.
I've never been hiding my politics, including my final elections.
No one in the Nottingham East was confused by my political views and differences with today's leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday events, I want to say only one thing: in the circumstances where the country goes to Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and government services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Notingem Momentum, but for my voters, both the Leiborist Party and not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise that no threat to withdraw me and no political benefit will prevent me from acting according to the best interests of you all.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air rises
The last two attempts might have distorted the final outcome, but Ire certainly deserved triumph in today's great entertainment game of the Prime Ship of Scotland.
Now they're headed by a table, this is the only invincible team of ten.
Finally, the excellent defense and improved ability to use the chances gives the masters and coach Peter Murchi the full right to be content.
“ Until now, we have been tested by our games, and we are still unsuccessful, so I have to be content, ” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I'm paying attention to Eir," they'd better use the chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt for 14 minutes, carried out by Frazier Climo, led Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Guz, published by Verriors, allowed mellrose to show numbers, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo strengthened the Air leadership by using the toolbars and just before the break did and did the salo-proof, which gave an account of 17-5 in favour of Air.
But the Melrose started a second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was removed from the field on the loads, and from the Restart, Air, came forward with the help of Stefford McDawell, who was carried out by Climo.
Bler McFerson, Captain Ayre, had a yellow card at the time, and once again, Melrose forced another player to pay the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colwin under intense pressure.
The hosts returned, but when Strauan Hutchinson received a yellow card for the interception of Climo without a ball from the penal line, McFerson made a tachdown behind the Air mole.
Climo tried what he did almost every time after the restart, afterward Kyle Row received a blow from David Armstrong in the box and sent a flanker to Gregor Henry for five attempts by the command of the masters.
Looks like a star still playing on a new career in a restaurant.
It seems that Ford Kiran's "A Still Game" star is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality. This is the conclusion after it is known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, which he writes and where he films with a long-standing cable partner, Greg Hemfield.
Douette announced that the next ninth series would be the last one in the series, and Kirnan seems to plan life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source of the Scottish Sun implied that Kirnan wanted to enter the “prosperous restaurant business ” of the Glasgo.
"More Our": Intra-matter Bolivia hopes that the court will open her way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the ocean-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by mosquito: “The dream is right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no way to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that Chile has gone away in the 19th century's bloody conflict through natural resources, and there is a desire to swim again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on October 1, after five years of trial.
“Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsada, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ICJ decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that after decades of subversive talk, Chile will negotiate Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion in the following year, also holds great hope for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the authority to condemn Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision was taken only six months after the final arguments were given indicates that the matter was “not difficult, ” said Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert in international law.
Bolivia’s case has not progressed, and for the past four years it has been possible to retreat back.
“The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration, ” said Zaratie.
The warrior rhetoric of Morales blew the remains of Chile’s kindness, and she suggested it.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltse, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that the court’s approval was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences by gaining mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsada also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Jong Ho, says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington.
Rhe spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the subordinate countries.
His comments appeared when United States secretary Mike Pompeo seemed to be at the threshold of re-launching nuclear diplomacy, which went into the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ry says that belief that the continuation of the U.S. sanctions and opposition declarations about the conclusion of the Korean war will once be placed on the knees of North Korea is “an unfulfilled dream. ”
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and American President Donald Trump want to meet again.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyangs take seriously the rejection of their arsenals, which the country probably considers as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang the next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
On the Paris fashion shows presented the last trend of massive main bathrooms, which is already going to the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or hide completely from the sun, you find what you need.
Valentino designers and Tom Brown showed a number of eccentric major decorations from spring-lito 2019 on the brilliant Paris week of fashion.
And the very non-practical hats were filled by Instagram this summer, and the designers they called have already sent their bizarre creatures beyond the playground.
Valentino stands out an extravagant refugee hat with broadly decorated field feathers, which closed the model heads.
Among other versus axes are adorned with precious coffee stones, a hat of witchcraft, and even a hat of ananas, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated the asortimation of the original masks — very timely before Helovin.
Many of these colorful masks had slew lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashions.
One creation resembled a submarine swimming with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like a ice cream horn that had been stretched out.
And if you support this serious fashionable application, you're lucky.
Stilients say that huge hats can go to the main streets of your city.
The versais capelukhs came into the fashion because of La Bombie, a straw hat with a field of 60 centimeters wide, which was seen at all: from Ryanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
A cult brand behind a very non-working hat that was visible everywhere in social networks gave peace to another creation: a straw beach bag of about the size of a model in a bather that carried it.
The bag of the yellow, red raffeine, with a raffe and a white leather handle, was the central element of La Riviera's collection in spring 2019, Jacquemus brand for the Paris week of fashion.
The celebrity of Luke Armitage told F D.A.: “In the next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of the designer is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for a versus axes.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is compulsory for the citizens of the world.
Scotland’s independent schools support high standards of education, and in 2018, the results of exams that are complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music, and other fields were again achieved.
These schools, with over 30,000 students in all over Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SWDS), which seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are going to prepare students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and to make them citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a person who understands the language, he understands it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her own language, she will take it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's exams, we see that language ratings are being used in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received higher level A.
The data collected in 74 schools in SRNS showed that 72 percent of the students received higher A from Chinese, and 72 percent from German students, 69 percent from French students, and 63 percent from Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now language as a subject is being taught in the same way as NTIM objects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and other institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Training Commission in 2014 revealed that 17% of the reasons why employers are unable to close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly needed in preparing young people for a future career.
Since more and more promising positions need language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Whatever the career you've chosen, if someone learns the second language, it's going to have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifetime skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages a superiority over competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent were unable to speak in foreign language well enough to support the conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a ambiguous percentage of people (15%).
That's why investment in language teaching is now important for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will give children more chances to find a full - time job.
In Scotland, they will learn their languages at each school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be the most important language in Britain from the 2020 prospect, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child in independent schools, several languages can always be chosen to study with qualified teachers.
Scotland independent schools try to create a educational environment that prepares children and armies them with the skills they need to achieve success regardless of what has prepared them for the future.
Now we can't deny that in the international business language environment, it's still vital for the future of the country, so that's to be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be viewed as “the habits of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to make this choice, varieties, and perfection for Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scotland Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts from Lakers in San Diego
The fanates who want to see Lebron James start for Los Angeles Lakers are almost waiting.
Luke Walton, a trainer in Lakers, announced that James would play on Sunday on the first pre-session match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, not yet decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48, ” said Walton on the official Lakers site.
Likers reporter Mike Trudell reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six games in the Likers Preseson Graph.
“ At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-session games, ” he replied.
Trampa rings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is now starting a series of pre-election rallys from Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump's scheduled next week, including ratings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidate offered to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and the Tramp seeks to form support for future middle-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
At what hour will today's West Virginia’s Trump Summit be held, and how can we see it on the Internet?
Hitting Trump in Willing in West Virginia scheduled for 19 hours east time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump in West Virginia online below in a direct episode on YouTube.
The trump will probably refer to the tensions of the hearings that took place this week in connection with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano, who is charged with sexual harassment, and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
But the main goal of this series is to help republicans to gain popularity before elections in November.
Representatives of President Trump stated that these five mittings next week are aimed at “activation of volunteers and adherents, because the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of the ones they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, reports Reuters.
“The Congress is so critical for its order of day that the president will go to as many states as possible, for the tense electoral season is approaching,” said Reuters, a representative of the Thrump campaign who did not want to call his name.
In the Wesbanko Arena Stadium, today’s Wing City, adherents from Ohio and Pennsylvania may come to the visit, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second month of his visit to West Virginia, where he obtained more than 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
The trump is trying to help a republican candidate to the West Virginian Senate of Patrick Morrisi, whose rating is behind the surveys.
“ It is not good for Morrisi that the president is coming to raise his rating in the surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder's Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hope for the day before Sunday singles
After the three sessions that ended with a unilateral victory, the trousers of the Sabbath may become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The whiting pendulum is a fully fictioned sports concept that the players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say that the pulse works?
"They were ahead of six points, and now, four points, I think we're taking it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, and they're also encouraged, not least by the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each made three points out of four.
The spoon with his killer blows from those rooms to the grenade shows an example.
These groaning celebrating screams became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a critical patt and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas were backed up by two points.
His patt, who allowed them to win a 15-hole match, met with a similar scream that tells you that the American team doesn't seem.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match,” said Spit.
That's all that each of these players left now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but adorable couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
The Molewood was the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also succeeded in avoiding the gods in the morning of Saturday and after lunch on Friday and on nine last holes Friday morning.
This run and the way their energy seems to flow to this stormy crowd and back, makes them believe that they won on Sunday and that they will no longer be popular players except Flytwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
Both are desired at the same time on different holes.
However, talking about the triumph of Europeans is still early.
The Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dismantled with Sergio Garcia, a hero of morning trousers when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
One god and two dubles on the first nine holes led the Spanish and the Swedish to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one can help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to see the trophies and forks around because of the interactions between the couple, because of the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of the Forsom also showed that the U.S. team is going to fight, where some, especially Americans, are questioning.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day, Ryder Cup Europe will have a strong advantage, because after Saturday forbols and forks, it's going to go ahead of the United States with an account of 10 to 6.
Inspired duet Tommy Flytwood and Francesco Molinari have won two triumphs over the backstage of Tyger Woods, and now they have four balls on Le Golf National.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who's trying to get back the trophies that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forbols with 3-1 count.
The U.S. resisted more in the forsoms and won two matches, but they couldn't shorten the gap.
Jim Furik's command needs eight points in 12 Sunday synthesiss to save the trophies.
Flytwood is the first European novel who conquered four consecutive glasses, while he and Mollinari (with Mollywood) after the sensational weekends are only the second couple who took four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing the Woods and Patrick Reed in the Forbolls, they united in order to defeat the abnormal Woods and the new American Bryson Dashambo with even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed random bursts of genius, but at the moment he lost 19 out of 29 of his trousers and trousers and seven consecutive matches.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in the morning forbollocks, went back to Henric Stenson's partner in forsoms to get defeated by 2ta1 from Destin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world rating.
Europe couldn't do it in its own way to this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three times the chief winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans with their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2ta1 victory over Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in trousers and later won Poulter and Rory McLroya with 4ta3 in forsoms, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder's Cup has the team returned with a deficit of four points in the synchrons, although the Furik team needs nothing to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like she can't do it.
North Korea says that "no in which case" will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
The North Korean Foreign Minister on Saturday informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told at the annual UN General Assembly that in the past year North Korea used “neutral goodwill measures”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear test sites and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“One day, we don’t see a proper U.S. response, ” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri has repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington’s “secondary ” approach to denucleication, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its progressive steps, his statement has proved to be important because it did not reject the unilateral denucleication that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kima Chen In and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “the dentalization of the Korean peninsula”, and the Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea is looking for a formal conclusion of the Korean war between 1950 and 53 years, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang should first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also resists the call to weaken the hard international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. is insisting on “denucleurization at first” and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even denialing“ an announcement of the end of the war, ” said Ri.
“ To think that sanctioning can put us on our knees is an inexcusable dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader emphasized at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings of Kim and the south Korean leader Muna Je-In in the last five months, and added: “If the issue of denuclearization was to be South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have gone into such a deaf angle.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri was sharply different from the last one when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korea's missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the "Mistry Wicked President" Trump called Kima "mankind-rocket" who wants to commit suicide.
This year, the UN Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea, praised Kima for the courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much more would be done and sanctions should remain in force until the denuclearization of North Korea.
In Wednesday, Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo stated to the United Nations Security Council in Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and incessantly until we see the complete, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unequivocally increased its sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of Phenyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly bulletins and then said that the next month he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea sentenced him for “gangster requirements. ”
During a meeting with the Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures. ”
He said that, according to Kima, he needed “appropriate measures” as security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students have a course on how to rest enough.
The new course at Harvard University this year has provided all his students with more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of learning rotten all night after filling caffeine.
The teacher found that university students at number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of self - care.
Charles Chasler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigam Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate a course after he gave a lecture on the impact of deprivation of sleep on learning.
At the end, a girl came to him and said, "Why do I have this now, at the latest?"
“ She told her that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me, ” the teacher explained to The Telegraph.
The course that was first introduced this year explains how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, as well as improve overall welfare.
Paul Barreyra, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, explained that the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been found that the students had been severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's an image of the room in the group where students click cups of coffee, coachs, and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficits on sports indicators, and the importance of the routine associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, the Campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking,” added Professor Chasler.
The culture of pride for “sleeping all night” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technology and growing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
A good dream must be a secret weapon of a student to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with a set of extra weight, since deprivation of sleep translates his brain into a famine regime that causes permanent physical famine, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler to develop a course after he was enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard's first year.
He said that that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campaign.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all postgraduate students with a request for a similar curriculum before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chasler recommends that students be reminded of the need to go to bed, and that the alarm be placed on the alarm and the harmful effect of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and light - diameter lamps, and that it can break the circus, causing problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Reingers: Menga's glimpse upset Jerrard's boys
Reingers has survived another attack of exiting grief: Dolly Menga's blow brought a striking defeat to Steven Jerrard's team, accounted for 1-0 from Livingston.
The Ibrokes team wanted to win its first win at a visiting match after the February triumph of Saint Johnston with a 4-1 account, but Gary Holt defeated Jerry as an 18 game manager. The Jerard team remained eight points behind the leaders of the Scotland Premiersip Harts.
Manga killed seven minutes before the break, and Rengers, who lacked inspiration, did not look like he could compare the account.
Now, “Ringers have gone to the sixth position, and Livingstone has risen to the third, and only Hibernian has the balls ahead of them.”
In addition, Reingers may have encountered another problem, since the Kalum Spence liner was forced to handle the head wound after being thrown out of the guest sector.
Jerard made eight changes in the team that had once been passing by Air in the half-final Cup of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same "Levie 11" composition that took one point in Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way that his opposed boys oppressed rivals in every step.
Maybe Rangers dominated the ball, but Liveingston worked more with the ball that was received.
They were to kill in just two minutes when Scott Pittman's first pass of Menga to the free zone let Scott Pittman hit the gate of Allan McGregor, but the semi-protector was wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the gate.
Keagan Jacobs had a deep free blow to Craig Halkette, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, hit the back of the trouser.
Reingers really got control, but at the last third there was more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos doubtless felt that he should get the right to the toolbar at a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Loules, but the report by Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Reingers had only two blows on the gate at the first time, but Liam Kelly’s former gatekeeper Liam Kelly struck Lassan Culibali’s head and the calm blow of Ovie Ejaria was almost intimidated.
Although the overhead of Livingstone for 34 minutes may have contradicted the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
Reingers failed again to deal with Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple end.
During the Jerard break, he replaced the Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the gigger hit Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blew off his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play exactly the game they like when Litgo and Halkette do one long pass after another.
The Hall team was able to improve the results at the last stages, but McGregor was well opposed to Jacob before Litgo had hit the corner.
Glenn Middlton, replaced by the Redgers, made another late application for a fine when confronted Jacobs, but Thomson again took a look.
Almanah: Geiger’s inventor
And now the page from our Almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... in Germany a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Gaeger.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, counting Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of popculture, for example, in the 1950s Coffee Coronado film with Rogers and Dale Evans, which play questionable cowboys-scientists.
Husband: What's that?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can really hear how radioactivity in minerals affects atoms.”
Evans: "Well, it's really pissing now!"
Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of treatment
The method foresees the removal of immune cells into the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to see a protein that is common to many species of cancer, and then these cells are reintroducing the patient again.
A test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
In a woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, the cancer of eggs has disappeared by more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells into the patient, the change in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” common to many types of protein cancer (HER2), and the further reintroducing of these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Bathesd Cancer, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several kinds of cancer," including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and coloric cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves the removal of immune cells from patients and their “training ” to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one type of leukemia.
After the SNL show in the MAG Baysball Studio, Kanye West gave a sharp talk in support of President Trump,
who caused the negative reaction of the audience
The students in the SNL Studio (The Saturday evening in the direct air) sanctified Kanyeo after his muscular speech, during which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trump and announced that he would be presidential in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town, in a baseball with the inscription "We Return America the Former Glory" he exploded in a tyranny in which he exposed the democrats, and once again declared his support for the Trump.
"Sometimes during the conversation, the whites ask me, "How can you like the Trump?
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago,' he said.
Shaw SNL was started with a skeleton by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed the testimony of Brett Kavano, which he gave to the Legal Committee of the Senate in the case of Christine Blaise Ford on sexual violence.
Although Vesta's talk was not broadcast on a direct episode, videos with his tyrannical tyrants were put on the social network by Comic Chris Rock.
Whether Rock wanted to ridicule Vesta by posting it, he would not understand.
The West also complained to the viewers that the craftsmen had an unpleasant situation because of the main bathroom.
According to Washington Examiner, the West said, "When I was in the building, I was rude.
They told me, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball."
They've been kidding me!
And then I'm told that I'm in a place where the oppressed are silent."
The West continued, "Do you want to see the place where the oppressed are silent?" I'm going to put on my superman baseball because nobody can tell me what to do, you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the Weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused negative reactions to the audience in the hall, and the SNL actors looked lost, and one of the audience said, "The studio had a dead silence."
Westa was invited to replace Arian Grande, whose ex - boyfriend, Reper McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West caused many surprise by performing song I Love it (I love it) in a suit of water Perrier.
The Westa supported the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote in Twitter, "One of the most daring: THAT I KNOW FOR THAT ABOUT THE NATOUS."
Instead, the leader of the show Karen Ganter wrote in Twitter that the West is who it is, and it's just great.
"But I'm not going to reward him by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his art, who, I think, is confessing and exposing ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
She added the same thing to us,"
Before the Reper show, he announced in Twitter that he changed the name: now he's the one who's known as Kanye West.
Vest is not the first artist who changed the name, he is following the example of Dieddy, also known as Puff Deddy, Puffy, and Pi Diddy.
College-reper Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lyon, and we know that the music legend of recent decades, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then became "Artist previously known as Prince."
Accusation of attempting deliberate murder after an attack with a knife at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting a deliberate murder after another man's wounded a knife in one of the East Belfast restaurants on Friday.

The Public Prosecutor's Office is an indictment.
The Star of the "Game of Coffins" by Keith Herington condemns the idealization of brutality.
Kit Herington became famous because of the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the rough medieval fantastic Fantasy Game of the thrones of the production of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor of speech condemning the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that because of these heroes on the screens, young boys often feel that they should be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview of The Sunday Times Culture Kit stated that he thought, "Something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the epoch of Hishteg #MeTo (#atayay, #latege, etc.).
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on the Throne, a 31-year-old actress by Rose Leslie, pointed out that he was "sufficiently determined" to deal with this problem.
"I am now quite determined when we are on the slippery path of the idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up because of the prism of the problem that we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partially responsible for the popularization of brutality through images of extremely courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What's natural, what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such men?
I think it's a really important question today, How do we change it?
You know, it's obvious that young guys are out of the right way."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any priquells and the Siekbels of the Throne after the next summer's show, because "he's already done with battles and horses."
From November, Keith will play the play of the real West play, Sam Shephard, the story of the film producer and his burglar brother.
As actor recently confessed, he considers a meeting with his wife, Rose the best one he's got from participating in the Throne Series.
"Since the films in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me his future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantastic series that got the rewards of Emmi, Rose played Igritt -- the love of hero Gerington John Snow.
A couple were married in June of 2018, and the ceremony was held in the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China claims a sharp increase of 14% of new cases
China reported a sharp increase of 14 percent of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health authorities, there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
In 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, which indicates a change in the past.
For a long time in some parts of China, HIV was spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusion.
However, as reported by officials at the conference in the province of Junnan, the number of people who are infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China grew by 100,000 compared with the previous year.
HIV transmission in time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT is often discriminated against.
According to studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry later because of the domination of conservative values in the country.
In most cases, the transmission of the disease is due to the misuse of sexually transmitted remedies.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV - related drugs in a partial way.
Maxine Waters denys the downpour of the data from the post-employment senators on the network by her employee and criticizes the "dangerous lie" and "theory of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Wotters, condemned voice statements that one of her state employees had placed personal data from three U.S. republican senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
Democrat from Los Angeles claims that these statements are spread by political observators and websites.
"The lie, the lie, and then the more abhorrent lie," said Waters in Twitter.
It is reported that the public information contained home addresses and telephone numbers from Utah’s U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch, Uta.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person with the Capitol when he was listening to the Senate Commission on the charges of sexual abuse against Brett Kavano, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court.
The data leaked some time after the three senators interrogated Kavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and Red State, information came about that the IP address of the source of the leak is linked to the Waters office and it was able to find the data of its staff member.
"These unfounded claims are absolute wrong, they do not meet reality," continued Waters.
"The co-worker of my office whose personal data and security is threatened by these fabricated and lying statements has nothing to do with the outflow of this information.
These unfounded claims are absolute false, they don't correspond to reality."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized on the network, among other things, the former Spokesman of the White House, Ari Flayscher.
"It's a denial of anger," wrote Flayscher.
"This suggests that with that nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of what he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not be presumptuous.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He has to stay calm and tranquillity."
Looks like Flayscher had a parallel between the Voters reaction and the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavano, who was accused of looking too angry at the Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republican Party, who was балouting to take place in Waters on the results of the intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"That's the news, if everything's really true," he wrote.
In Woters' statement, she said that her office had already reported "the relevant government authorities and the legal authorities on these false claims."
"We'll do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
An overview of the film "Agent Johnny Inglis: New Mission" is a passive paradigm for spy fighters with Roven Atkinson
And it's already a good tradition to look for every new British film of thought, Brexit, and they're in a new part of a series of comic porodiums on Jonnie Inglisch, and the first film called "Johnny Inglisch" was released in 2003, and then a series was reinstated in 2011 by "Jonnie Inglis: Re-starting."
Is it going to be a ridiculous, ironic self-satisfying of what we are inexperienced, a new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Ingliss, with his moving face and his bent-in eyes, was able to make a mess, and his name is more than anything else, indicates that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As we know, Johnny is a fascinately jolly secret agent in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there's a little from the inspector Cluzo, a little from Mr. Bin and a lot of things from the guy who played one note of the "Fighted Wheel" film at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London in 2012.
The foregleam of the character is also the traveler and the mystery of the international scale, which has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten TV ads of Barclaycard.
In the last movie about Johnny Ingliss, there are some good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingliss approached the helicopter in his knight’s helmet, and the sculpture shovels flyed about his helmet.
Atkinson's talent to buffalo is well uncovered, but humor is outgoing, and in some moments it's too much, especially if you compare to "serious" movies like "Agent 007" and "Missia is impossible," one of the "insредents" that is also a comedy.
It seems like the jokes are designed for children rather than for adults, and I don't feel as ingenious and thoughtful as Atkinson's doctrinal movies about Bin.
As usual, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British super secret network of spies penetrates the hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise for an active agent (Alas Kevin Eldon played only an episode in the film).
This proved to be the last drop for the Prime Minister, a haughty person who has already experienced destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity.
The intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to get someone out of the retreat.
The choice falls on a clumsy Johnny Inglis, who now works as a teacher at some supermodal institution and unofficially teaches children operational undercover (in this part with a spy year's "Spain School," "Some good jokes for teenagers."
Other people quickly get to Whitegol for an emergency briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller in another time.
The buff is now married to the captain of a submarine (the role of an exalted, annoying person is not altogether in line with the talent of Wiki Pepperdin).
So when everything in the Secret Service of her Majesty went to the steebert, Betman and Robin are back in line and suddenly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov played by Olga Curilenko.
And at that time, the Prime Minister comes under the charismatic fan of a charismatic billionaire who earned his wealth in technology and technology and claims to be able to address the problem with the British network, the ominous Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lace.
Others and Buff travel and again use their ridiculous grotesques: overwhelmed by waitresses, they fire in a fabulous French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally traveling abroad on a magnificent Volta yach; Ingil set up a real turmoil when trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to get acquainted with the planning of the Volt house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but by their kindness and outrage, it is like movies for children.
It's a passing film.
And as I looked at other movies about Johnny Inglis, I asked myself the same question, is it that the British movie industry can't offer Roven Atkins the role that really corresponds to his talent?
Leiborists deny the preparation of the plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but they will receive a salary in five days.
The Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but they're going to be paid for five days.
It's reported that the party wants to oblige the company leaders to transfer the money saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, to employees, giving them additional output.
Thus, the workers will have a three - day weekend, bringing the same salary home.
According to sources, this idea will be in line with the party's economic program and will direct the country's resources to support the worker class.
The four-day work week transition was approved at the British convention of the Threed Junion, and it seems that the workers will be able to benefit from a change in the global economic situation.
The source in the Leiborist Party reported The Sunday Times, "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything won't change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Leiborists weren't the first to accept this idea, because the Green Party promised to have four days of work during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Leiborist Party are currently favored by this desire.
The Speaker of the Leiborist Party said, "The party's political program does not have a four-day work week, so we're not looking at this idea right now."
"Tink Chancellor" John McDonnel presented his vision of the Socialist Revolution in the Economy at the Leiborist Party's electoral assembly last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to take the power back from the "unlimited directors" of the communal enterprises and the exploiters.
The "Tink" Chancellor plan also means that shareholders of water supply can not get all of their share of capital if the Leiborist government brings a "delivery" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed his intention to include workers in company rule and to create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the normal shares of private sector firms to workers waiting for annual dividends of up to 500 pounds of sterling.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell in 60 Minutes (60 minutes) or can investigate the case of Cavano, which leads the FBI, change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano, led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week, and the question arises whether the republican senators will continue to support the Kavano after the results of the investigation of the Bureau.
In Sunday show 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pellie asked the Senators of the Republic of John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, could the FBI find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.--
During my hearings, I explained that I had a conversation with Judge Kavano.
I called him after all that happened and the accusation, and I asked him, “Did you really do that?”
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greham’s opinion will no longer change.
"I think the charges against Kavano are provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that this is what Brett strongly denied," he added Graham, turning to Christine Blaise Ford.
And every one she calls is unable to confirm it under oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival — a yearly event in a music world with an astonishing number of star artists and an equally spectacular mission — to overcome poverty all over the world.
During the seventh festival of Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobbed in the Great Gallery of the Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival – organizers seeking to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization hoping to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (if you don't want to pay VIP ticket), visitors have to do a number of tasks or actions, such as being taught in the volunteer project, to write an e-mail to the world leader, to make a phone call or anything else, to help bring attention to the purpose of the organization -- the eradication of poverty.
So are there any results now, because the Global Citizen organizers have left for 12 years?
Is it really an idea to reward a free concert, a genius way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicitism," when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or making a Twitter publication?
According to the Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "works" of their adherents aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have led world leaders to claim more than $37 billion planned financial apportionment and programmes that will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited as an example the results of its activities 390 financial obligations and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to estimates, the cost has had a direct impact on the lives of some 649 million people around the world.
The Power of Nutrition, which has a territorial relationship to the UK as part of the investor and realiser's project, has committed themselves to "helping children grow" and has pledged $35 million to help Rwanda overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages from the Global Citizens organization in Twitter.
"In support of the British government, the methenists, the governments of other countries and the citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of undernourished by the fact of history," said the representative of the organization The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public during the living concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "works" that called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the British government announced the allocation of funds for the The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the diet of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome the extreme poverty rate?"
The Global Citizen wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But like the civil rights movements and against apartheid to us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the group The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanell Mona, is just a part of the star artists who will perform this year's festival in New York, and will lead him to Deborah-Li Fernes and Guy Jackman.
The Minister of Internal Affairs stated that the U.S. could use naval forces to blockades to prevent Russian energy exports.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Interior, Rayan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can seek help from the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke stated that Russia’s participation in the Syrian conflict, especially where it acts to invite a legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy markets.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be a mediator in energy trade, as they're already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. Naval forces for free passage through the seaways and, if necessary, for blocking them so that Russian energy will not enter the market," he said.
The Consumer Energy Alliance (Energy Consumer Alliance) was a non-profit organization in the United States.
He then compared the trade approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually similar.
"Economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace them with alternatives," he said, "Russia is "onely developed" because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these statements were heard, the Trump Administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, replacing the Russian energy market with a much cheaper version for Europeans.
For this, the Trump administration and the President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to give up the "negative" project of the North stream 2, which, according to the Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly emphasized that the North Flux 2 gasoline, which costs $11 billion and doubles the capacity of an existing gasogon to 110 billion cubic meters, is exclusively an economic project.
The Kremlin convinces that Washington is fervently opposed to the project for only economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and consumer should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian minister of energy, Alexander Novak, after meeting with U.S. Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, who was in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
BDI called on the United States not to intervene in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like when the third country intervenes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of the German industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angels Mercel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Worren "seriously thinks" about the presidential bathing in 2020.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would "reasonably think" about the posting of the president after the intermediate elections.
During a meeting with the public in the city of Golioc, Massachusetts, Worren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, "The time for women to go to Washington to set up a government job, and for that, there must be a woman on his forehead."
"First of November 6th, I'm going to think seriously about putting my candidacy to the presidency."
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of President Donald Trump, claiming that he would "take his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Vorren was frank, criticizing the Trampa and his proposed candidate for the office of the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavano.
In the Friday Tweet, Worren wrote, "...no doubt, before the FBI vote, it's supposed to be investigated."
However, according to a Friday survey, most Vorren voters do not believe that they should vote in 2020.
According to a survey conducted jointly by the Center for Political Studies at the University of Saffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential candidates in Massachusetts were opposed by the senator.
Thirty-two percent supported the promotion.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive and 38% of his potential presidentship was expressed, against 48%.
During the discussion of the candidates for other famous democrats who can talk in 2020, they also call former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Baiden stated that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Paylin recalls the PTSD Trek Paylin during a visit to support Donald Tramp
26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after he entered military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son's going through now, what he's going through after his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are going home," she said before the visitors to support Donald Tramp in Talls, Oklagoma.
Paylin called the arrest of Trek a "proximity that no one pays attention" and said that her son and other veterans of war are returning to their homes, not as they used to be more cruel, and they want to know if they respected here what they have made their soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country.
According to the spokesman of the police department of Vasil, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasil, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, as well as hindered from reporting an incident of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcoholic drunkenness.
18 states and districts in Colombia support shelter policy complaints
Eighteen states and county of Colombia support the new U.S. policy, which refusal to grant refugee status to victims of gangs and domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analytic note to the court counselor in Washington to support a caller who needed shelter and appealed to the court order mentioned.
The full name of the loan in Grace v. Ceshn's case is for the American Civil Rights Union, which is accused by federal policy and which was filed in August is not open.
The loaner stated that her partner "and his cruel bandits" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
She was illegally held in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace’s claims stated that the inhabitants of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (often asked for shelter in the United States) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee policy cancels the decision of the Appeals Council on immigration in 2014, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence could seek shelter.
General Carl Reisin, the Attorney-General of the Colombian County, in his presentation on Friday, stated that the new policy "is disregarding decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on the facts and circumstances set forth in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle," is contained in the analytic note of the court consultant.
Next, in the analytic note, prosecutors argue that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is harmful to the economies of the country, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "to fill the necessary labour resources."
The Attorney General Jeff Ceshns issued an order for immigration judges in June that they were no longer able to grant refugee status to those fleeing from domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial belonging, religion, nationality, membership in certain social groups or political opinions," said Sashnes during the presentation of the policy on June 11th.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers desperately try to find the survivors, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, reassuring her boy with a fever at the evacuation center of the ruined city of Pala.
"Every minute, quick help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take back underflows, trying to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been traumatized, and the hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, including two Heris with a back and shoulder break, rest at the building of the army hospital Palu, where patients are provided with open - air help through constant resurgences.
His eyes filled with tears when he remembered how strong a push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I've been squeezed in the debris of the wall,' said Heris, correspondent to the Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife begged for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "psychic pressure" using "relams that contain propaganda."
A week after the state Chinese newspaper posted on the four pages of the American daily publication advertising material on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a payable addition to China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa following China's accusation of trying to influence the elections to Congress that will take place on November 6, China rejects these charges.
According to Reuters, officials in the United States, the Trump’s statements in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to intervene in the American elections mean a new phase of the escalation from Washington, D.C., which aims at pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place advertising for trade intensification, there is a trade war escalating between Beijing and Washington, where they have already raised the customs for imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, in the beginning of this war, repressive customs in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa who supported the Republican Trump Party.
Terry Brensted, US Ambassador in China and former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest agricultural exporter to China, claimed that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the Sunday Registry in Des Moines, "strengths pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American people's tradition of freedom of speech and press independence by posting a payroll advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Brensted.
"In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of different people, and here you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of developing the Chinese economy, which is a cause for concern, from which you can conclude that China's media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the respectable Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but he didn't say what it was.
Analysts warn that the Republicans fail from Kavano to set themselves up against women voters before the elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, Brett Kavano, after several sexual harassment charges were filed, analysts warn that this could cause undesirable reactions to future intermediate elections, especially women.
Around this situation, passion is rampant, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to proceed to vote.
Such things can't be played back afterwards," said the interview of the The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell Sirakouz University.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation at which, in the last minute, urged Senator Jeff Flake (Arisonan Republican) would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C, the chief adviser and spokesman of the Progressive MoveOn Group said, "Women won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget about it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, the protesters sang "Listopast is coming!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to Cavano's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with Steve Rotenberg's news website, a non-party political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"That's what they say right now, and that's true.
But motivation can increase, especially in the election women of 18 to 29 years from the premium, who have not yet been identified and often don't vote, if they don't like the president."
Before Ford testified on the charges of a candidate for the Supreme Court's position in sexual crime, analysts had predicted the negative reaction of the voters if the Republicans insisted on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel stated, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As the News Channel interviewed, the Director of Priorities of the United States (U.S. Pre-election Groups) Gay Cesil said, "the right is not to vote in a committee, final vote, or the fact that Kavano is at the rank of the defendants, and how they reacted to this situation and how they proceeded."
And yet, the Americans think about whose testimony, Ford or Kavano, is divided, and a little bit more support is given to Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe in Ford's testimony, while Kavano's witness believes or believes 35% more of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents pointed out that they believed that Kavano had given false testimony, or most likely given false testimony, while Ford had said the same thing to 30 percent of the interviewed.
According to The Guardian, after Fleek’s insistence, the FBI is conducting a test of charges issued by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under the oath of the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavano attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that the candidate for the position of the Supreme Court of Justice showed her his genitals at a party during their studies at the University of Elli in the 1980s.
The Internet inventor is planning to run the "new Internet" to create a competition for Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners Lie, the inventor of the global Internet, starts a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of a world of technology, Inrupt, is to develop a platform with an open source code Solid, the idea of Berners-Lee.
With a Solid platform, users can choose where to store data and who to provide access to one or more information.
In an exclusive interview Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that Inrupt's purpose was world domination.
'We must do it now,' he said about the startup.--
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create a "personal online storage" or a POD.
It can store contact lists, current business lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online storage is that it is fully suited to the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "extension of personal opportunities with data."
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to harness resources, processes, and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform available to everyone.
At present, the company is made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms acquired in IBM, a few state developers hired to work on the project, and volunteers.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lie stated that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to do a full replacement when all their business models were undergoing major changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners Li wrote that the Inrupt mission is "to secure commercial energy and ecosystems and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the basis of the Solid Platform."
In 1994, Berners Li transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners Lie is an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even at the start of the Inrupt, Berners-Li remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Foundation of the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistic at the next age of networking," added Berners Lie.
Bernard Vann: celebrations on behalf of a church representative of the Victoria Cross during World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Victoria Cross order for fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded to participate in Bellengiz and Leokure on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper balloon four days later and never found out that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren discovered a memorial stone during the parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, called the "predominantly figurative" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather did a feat, for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through St. Catan through a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he hurried to the fireplace and with the fierce braveness led a line forward, and before that one went to the field gun, and destroyed three guns of the hostile unit.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather did what he could never have done and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Wann laid a crown after a parade under the leadership of the Brentwood group Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wann said, "It feels very proud to be involved in this parade," and he added, "the courage of the real hero is showing the honor that so many people show him."
Fani MMA didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "The Pepp Lead."
Imagine that you're not going to sleep all night just to see the tournament of Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to review the major event.
The tournament in San José showed 13 fights, including six of the main programs that were broadcast live in the nighttime in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were ready to join, the U.K. TV watchers died of a surprise when a peppe pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some spectators were not thrilled because they had not slept until the morning waiting for the battle.
One fan wrote in Twitter that switching to a child's cartoon seemed to him an "an unlucky joke."
"In accordance with the decision of the Government of Content, which was broadcast at 6 p.m., it was inappropriate, so they were forced to let go the child's transmission," said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Bellator's ties to the public when he was asked for a TV transmission,
"Peppe's lead," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker, president of the company, promised to work on a broadcast schedule in order to reach the audience in Britain in the future.
"I think if you're talking about repeating broadcasts, we'll be able to do it," said Coker.
"Oh, it's Sunday, six in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcasting was turned off, we received a lot of the messages we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out to be inconsistent with government orders.
I can promise you that this won't happen again.
We're going to shorten the tournament to five instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to redirect the signal for fans, but we're not trying to do that until now.
A really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone looked like him" until he went to high school.
In participating in Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he was frank about the rights of gays to give hope to others.
He also stated that his fatherhood had become less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
A long - term guide, Kirsti Young, went to hospital for a few months.
When he came to the first class of Lavern, Daley said he felt worse than others when he was a child, because "the community didn't understand when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the sense of lesser value and difference was exactly what gave me strength and strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that something was worthy, not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-fold Olympic Gazette became a famous fighter for LBGT community rights and took advantage of the emergence of this year's Co-job Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he was frankly talking about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give this hope to others.
A three - time champion of the world confessed that his feelings for a man, American filmmaker, Dastin Lance Bleck, who he met in 2013, was a real surprise to him.
Daley married the Oscar Prize laureate, 20 years old, last year, but he said the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much in this young age" (in the first Olympic games, he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would have survived similar flights and falls.
In June, a son came into marriage, called Robert Ray Black Daley, and from then on, according to Daley, his "discernment" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about getting the gold," he said.
"You know, there are things that are much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold is Robbie."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not accept the end, and before he died, he asked if they had purchased tickets for the London Olympics 2012 because they wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You won't sit in the first row because you're not going to be around," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the Olympic Games of 2012 and won a bronze.
"I knew that this was what I've been dreaming of for the rest of my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, and there wasn't a sense of better than that," said Daley.
It also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (The Mountain) in the execution of Ghisther Small — which resonated with him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still causes an ant.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11.15 on English summer.
On Saturday with a tournament match for the Ryder Coffee, Michelson was not in form.
American Phil Mikelson set the record on Sunday, playing his 47th tournament game for the Ryder Cup, but he has to rebuild the form so that it won't be unhappy for him.
Mikelson, who, in the 12th record, participates in the two-year tournament, brought Captain Jim Furick out of the game for the time of the forbols and forks.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner all day uptakes the team and trains on the side, hoping to master the emotions.
Since Michelson wasn't famous for the right blows even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete wasn't exactly suitable for a complex golf field for Le Golf National, where the raff is usually punishing for wandering blows.
And if it's not a barrier, in the ninth match on Sunday Micelson, you'll have to meet the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact stroke of Francesco Molinari, who won all his matches this week in a couple with Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans who stand three points after 12 solitary matches start well, Michelson's match can be a decisive one.
Furick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he must have had nothing to add.
"He fully understood his role today, weeped me on his back, hugged me, and said that tomorrow would be ready," said Furick.
"He has no doubt of his power.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Glory that has done so much for teams last and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I predicted more matches, but that's what happened, so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there in the field, like anyone else."
If Michelson gets out on the Saturday, he's gonna beat the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
In that, he might be able to complete his career at the Cube Raider tournament, which never matched his individual achievement.
On the account of Michelson 18 winners, 20 defeats, and 7 monstrous results, Furick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, ridiculous, witty, likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's cool with the team," explained Furick.
"I think the younger players had a good fun going on him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He's more than just a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big break doesn't decide anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a sensible break in front of the solitary matches of the last day's tournament for the Ryder Coffee doesn't guarantee victory yet.
Danish debuted in 1997 at a Walderram club match, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros took the Americans to five points, but won a little bit of a match with a result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Walderra field; a large break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and the Walderram field where we had been forced to win," said Bjorn after watching the games of Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has yet been solved.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum return.
Get out of the field and do all the things you need.
The game will only be finished when the result is on the tabloid.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I'm focusing on 12 players in our team, but we're well aware of who are the best players in the world."
Enjoyed by the performance of their players in a complex field, Bjorn added, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything can be different.
We're going to have individual matches tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's cool to play a field with a partner when it's going well, but it's when you're standing alone, and you can check what you're worth like a golfist.
Here's how to configure players to speak tomorrow: at the limits of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Biorn, Jim Furick expects his partners to play better individually, except for Jordan Speit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
To Furik's point of destiny on the last day, he came back from different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated by a team from Europe who created a "Medinah Times."
"I remember every cursed word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully like this in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone's side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We've put players in the team accordingly, as if we're going to do something amazing tomorrow."
Tomas was assigned to try to lead a top-master counter-stroke against Rory McIroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ian Poulter were on the first half of the European team.
"The most of these partners, and in this order, I chose because I wanted to share the effort equally throughout the whole game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship has been postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was expected to take effect in 2014, instead of the oldest cold war war vessels, but, according to local media, this will not be done by at least the next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the escalating costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, from the spokesman for military service, the launching of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, a series of modern fregats of the Baden-Wurtemberg class, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
This ship was supposed to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen after delivery damaged the implementation of an ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Urtemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, should replace the obsolete Bremen class.
Understandably, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-corruption missiles, as well as some techniques to reduce visibility, such as radiolocation, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer period of technology, and it is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the port of base for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that the constant delays in modern military ships that would increase Germany’s military power at sea will also make it obsolete at the time of the imposition.
The multi-stricken F125 frigate was in the headlines of the newspapers last year, when the German naval forces officially refused to take the ship into force and returned it to the Blohm + Voss ship in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship’s military ship has returned to a ship - building company after delivery.
The reason for the return is limited, but the German media mentioned significant “program and equipment defects” that made the warship unfit for military operations.
The software disadvantages are particularly important, since the Bayen-Württemberg ship's crew consists of about 120 sailors -- it's only half of the military that served on old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the vessel has a considerable surplus of weight, which makes its performance worse and limits the potential for further modernization.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz frigate is twice as heavy as (7,000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to malfunctioning equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have become colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
Problems in obtaining new fregates took on special importance in the light of recent warnings about the decay of the German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, the Bundestago Armed Forces of Hans-Peter Bartels reported that the country's Navy had "little ships available to carry out military tasks."
The ruler claimed that the situation had worsened rapidly for a time, since the old ships had been released from exploitation and no new ships were coming.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Baden-Wurtemberg fregates were able to fill the Navy.
The National Bat Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study in land ownership in the Scotland hills is intended to determine how bats use the landscape to find food.
Scientists hope that the results will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take steps to save them in the future.
In Invert gardens in Wester Ross, scientists of the Scotland National Trading are going to observe species such as the netopir of the dwarf and the natopy of the pygmies, as well as the ears of a normal and watery nightmare.
Special registries will be placed in strategic locations in land ownership to monitor bat behavior during the season.
The Scotland National Trading employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and acquiescence of bats.
Then we're going to develop a detailed map of animal habitat and prepare a report to link animals' behavior to their habitat.
Rob Duar, an environmental adviser in the Scotland National Trust, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas of life are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of care for the environment (e.g. the formation of meadows) and determine the optimal methods for forest conservation for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have declined considerably in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and cultivation of areas that deprive them of nesting sites.
Other negative factors include winding facilities and lighting, fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
Bats are virtually unblind.
However, by hunting at night, their ears are more effective in catching prey than their eyes.
They use a complex technique of echoing to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which cares for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special importance, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, the bat problems are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, nesting checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in Triv's place in the Dumphris-and-Gallova region, and it has eight out of ten species of bats that live in Scotland.
Controlling David Thompson claims to be an ideal place for them.
"In the territory of the place Tried the wonderful conditions for bats," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, lots of giant trees and other favourable living conditions.
But we also need to learn a lot about bats, because of the research that we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need for prosperity."
He insists that it's very important to check the area for bats before taking any technical work, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for a young man can kill up to 400 females with a baby, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The pets and their nests are protected by law, the animals are forbidden to kill, torment, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Centre, called on the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't discovered the characteristics of many species."
Ronaldou rejects the charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare a complaint against the German edition
Kristian Ronaldou called the accusations of rape "silence" and said that people are "striving to draw attention" using his name.
His lawyers are willing to file a complaint against the German journal Der Spiegel, which published suspicion information.
America Catherine Mayorga accused the front of the Congregated Portugal and the Juventus Soccer Club of rape, which took place in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronalda seemed to have paid her 375,000 dollars for silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldou, 33, turned to 142 million of his fans in Instagram videos, calling the corresponding messages "naklap."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," a statement was made to the camera by a five-fold owner of the Golden Ball.
"They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to reap on me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy person and I'm all right," he added, smiling.
According to the Reuters Information Agency, attorneys Ronaldu are preparing a claim against Der Spiegel for the published charges that they called “unappropriate reports of suspicion of privacy”.
Lawyer Christian Scherz stated that the soccerist would demand compensation for "moral harm in the amount of a serious violation, which is likely to be one of the most common cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting at the nightclub of Ronaldu and Mayorga, he returned to the player’s number, where he allegedly raped her anonymously, which was transmitted to the District Court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the incident described, Ronald fell to her knees and said he was a "99 percent good guy" who was "one percent."
As noted in the papers, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with a model, but by mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to an outsourcing settlement because she was afraid of revenge and guarded against "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous agreement, because she continues to suffer from the incident that she said happened.
At the beginning of the incident Ronald was preparing to move to the FC Real Madrid from the Manchester United FC, and this summer he became a player in the Italian football grende, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will "wonderfully regret" the loss of autoproducers
Great Britain will "wonderfully regret" if it loses the status of the world leader in the field of auto-profit after Brexit, which is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was welcomed by Toyota UK, who told BBC journalists that in the event of Britain’s unconcerned entry from the EU, the company would have to pause the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Minister Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the consequences of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
In Bernaston, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, some 150,000 cars last year, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain's extreno leaves the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, General Director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's exit from the EU will be marked without an agreement on international trade.
For example, BMW stated that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fears of car manufacturers are that Brexit without agreement can cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota's production line operates in operating delivery of parts and materials according to needs — details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for the automobile that are being ordered.
If the European Union leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruptions on the borders of the supply of details that will cause delays and shortages of materials.
So, as the company says, Toyota's warehouse can contain no more than one day, so it's going to have to stop production.
Greg Clark noted that in terms of the organization of relations with the EU, prepared by Teresa Mei (Chequers Plan), “there is a framework for avoiding problems at the border”.
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal deal, which I think will not only make it possible to succeed at the current moment but also take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program at Radio BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as other manufacturers, we need to save the high-efficiency supply chains."
Toyota hasn't been able to tell us how long the production will be stopped, but in the long run, it's expected that increased spending will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, as a result, cause the shortening of the jobs.
Peter Czularis, head of the Unit's Ombudsperson's unite office in Bernaston, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can tell from experience that short-term jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have set up a precise and reliable plan to build our future relationship with the EU."
A meeting of the Trump and Rosenstein can be postponed again, marking in the White House
As reported by the White House on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein may be "repeat for a week" while there are discussions about the nomination of Brettt Kavano to the office of judge of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of the special prosecutor Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's intervention in elections, the relationship between the Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential impediment to justice by the President.
For a few months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of a deputy of the Attorney - General threatening Mueller’s independence was discussed.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the use of microphones to record Trump talks and the possibility of short-term termination of Presidential powers by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was going to retire.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
The Trump stated that he would not want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered to conduct a weekly investigation of the FBI's charges against Kavano, which further postponed the vote in the Senate.
Spokesman for Trump, Sarah Sanders, went to Fox News Sunday television show.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not intended, maybe it's going to happen this week, and I'm expecting it to be postponed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But let's see, I keep track of the last information in the press."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders did not conduct briefings for media in the White House since September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of briefing is not related to publicity games, although she added, "I won't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that Trump himself would communicate more with the press.
"The president gives answers to the question more often than any president to him," she said, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders pointed out that the briefings are still going on, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to communicate frequently with the press, and it's supposed to be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the U.S. President is not worse than the press conference."
The trump regularly answers questions during activities outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, by treating journalists unpopularly and sometimes awkwardly.
Scotland State Health Secretary addressed a letter to the EU employees in connection with fears through Brexit
The State Health Secretary addressed the EU citizens of other countries working at the Scotland National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and to ask them to continue after Brexit.
Jin Freeman, a member of the Scotland Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scotland Government has already made commitments to cover the cost of applying for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "In the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the issue of exit have continued.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible solution without agreement.
I know that this period can be very disturbing for you.
That's why I'd like to emphasize again the way I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries outside it share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercrombi underwent an emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Ebercromebie, a guardian of Tennessee State Taygers, transferred an operation after receiving head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with the account 31:27, reported to the journalist of Tennessine.
The chief coach of Tennessee State Tygers told the reporters that the player had been traumatized shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he was bad," said Reed.
By side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombi oxygen before taking it on their loads for further examination.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Taygers reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, which Ebercrombie was operating at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there's no evidence of the type and the gravity of the injury." In Tennessee State Tigers, we're trying to find out when the player got a trauma.
Ebercrombie, a second-graduate student, spent his first season at Tennessee State Tygers after moving from the Illinois team.
He performed five balls on Sundays before he got out of the game, so in his season, he's got 18 rounds.

In the Ministry of Finance, we hope to involve additional Pound20 million a year to help the homeless
As Teresa Mei announced today, foreigners buying property in Britain will pay more taxes, and additional funds will be spent on help to the homeless.
This can be seen as trying to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to involve young voters in promises to provide more affordable housing targeted for high - paying workers.
Physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain will be affected by the increase in the customs, and the government will direct additional funds to help those who have to sleep under the open sky.
The additional ceremonies, which are accompanied by an increase in two - year - olds to a second tenure and real estate, may be three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected that additional £120 million will be added per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is being built in London is being owned by foreign nationals, and it's leading to higher prices and complicating the task of those who only dream about their own housing.
Many wealthy areas in the country, including the capital, are deserted, since the vast majority of foreign buyers live outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for the downsizing of the public service to make the home more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of supporting high prices of real estate by buying land without further use, and he called on Teresa May to relinquish the available real estate quotas in order to fix the "bad position on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the real estate, including rent control and deprivation of eviction without good reason.
He also suggests that the local councils be extended in the area of building a new home.
Teresa May said, "I promised last year that I'd dedicate my premierity to the renewal of the British dream, for every new generation of life, to be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
It is not fair, however, that individuals who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of home itself has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "First of all, I want to be the chief coach of the collection of Scotland."
Jack Ross, chief FC Sanderland coacher, says that "there's the best way to do it" is to take the lead in Scotland.
42-year-old Scotch took to rebuild the club from the northeastern country, which is now the third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Late this summer, returning the last Sent-Mirren season to the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to the second congregation of Scotland, but it's all over," -- told Ross during the Sportsound program at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of a collection of Scotland at the Hempden-Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful in the position of the chief coach of the club."
Ross' predecessors to the Sanderland FC included Deek Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Die Canyo.
The former head coach of the FC Alloa Atletic states that he was not worried about going to a big club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected the offers from the FC Barnsley and Ipswich Tower.
"I'm going to think at this point that I've succeeded if the club comes back to the Prime League.
Thanks to its structure and the logistics of this club, it is undoubtedly in line with the Premier League level," he said.
"It's going to be a challenge, but the other result I'm hardly going to think I'm going to be successful."
Ross is only building a coach career for three years, and before, he was a second coach at the Dumbarton FC, and he spent 15 months at the FC Garts Coach headquarters.
And then he helped Alloa to reconnaissance after the FC got into the third divideon, and in the next season, the Saint-Mirren went from the flight stage to the winner's title of the first dividend.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at the Claid, the Gartle, the Folkerk, the Saint-Mirren and the Hamilton Academical.
"I'm on a crossroads," he recalls, talking about going to the FC Halloa.
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more appropriate to me than to play.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, and I did a good job at it, and I reached some heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many difficulties that each week have to face.
I am still confronted by stress and stress, but as the main coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable as I've been in my adult life as after I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 Sunday - perfect time for beer cup
Summer heat helped increase the benefit of British pabs, which are not the best of times, but increased pressure on the restaurant network.
According to the calculations of sales in pubs and bars in July, 2.7 per cent increased, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
Says Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consultation: "Thanks for sun weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Championship, July went by the same pattern as the previous month, when the pub's benefit grew by 2.8%, but the restaurants have gone worse.
The heart fall of 1.8% in July has increased.
Pubs and bars that are designed to supply drinks in the meantime have the best results to increase their income is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs serving food were also affected by heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that the visitors are only interested in drinking.
In control pubs and bars, the sale of drinks increased by 6.6% per month, and the sale of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the leisure and hotel industry in RSM, said, "We've seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose their profits, and the annual decline in sales by 4.8% is causing special concern at the background of the need to reduce costs.
It's not the best time for food-purpose institutions, and we'll see if the temperature we've observed in August will be more moderate to give them such a necessary resting-time."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the marketing of new brands.
The gallose indicator of the sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants in Britain is a reflection of the collected and analyzed productivity rates of the 47 working groups, the combined product runs more than £9 billion.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from his parents.
According to the study, 1 out of every 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, is hidden from parents and teachers in social networks.
A study that covered 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "primary account" that is shown to parents.
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account in social networks that hides from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram, a social network to exchange photos.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20 percent of the students reported having a clean "core" account that is shown to parents and one or more private.
The mother, who accidentally found a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call to rape me there.
A study by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters 'and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools revealed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles in social networks.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We're really worried about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ailed Doyle will be a "presider of the interests of athletics" in the Scottish Athletics Council.
Alied Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general council of members of the government.
Doyle is the one founding Scotland light athlete, and the head of Jen Beatty described this step as an excellent opportunity for those who lead sports movement to take advantage of its broad experience gained at the international level during the last decade.
"Alide has great respect for Scotland, Britain and the world, and we believe that it will benefit from athletic sports in Scotland," assured Beatt.
Doyle said, "I'm going to be an inspirational representative of the athletes, and hopefully I can really benefit and promote sports in Scotland."
American, a four - time Olympic champion who won a race of 200 and 400 meters at Atlanta games in 1996, and now a BBC sports viewer, lost the chance of going through a transitory hychemical attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors argued that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to my incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again and today to do dynamic exercise!
Thank you for the word of support!"
In the moisture ad, women were compared to cows -- the Internet users' thoughts were divided.
The milk sucker producer encountered a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising, where young mothers are compared to the cows that are in place.
To celebrate the release of a product called "The First World's Silent Footwater Soaker," the technology company Elvie, the consumer product, released an ad in a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that the mothers are given to the new sucker.
Four real mothers dance in a cowed cow under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "When you see it yourself, it's not a waking, it's my chest."
And then the choir sings, "Sucks, sucks to feed kids, sucks, sucks, and milk doesn't waste."
However, an ad on the Facebook page led to an uproaring discussion online.
The video got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet users' responses were ambiguous, and many noted that the ads were underestimated by the "horrible organization" of milk production in industry.
"It's not a very clever decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give milk, but their children are mean to be taken away in a few days after birth,” wrote a user.
The Elvie milkweeder can be easily hidden in the vodka for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't you take them into the milk suckers advertising for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users were defending the advertisement video, and one of the women's videos was "very fun."
"I think that's a genius idea.
If she was still breastfeeding, she would have acquired such a thing.
When I sucked milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is something crazy, but I didn't look for the hidden contents.
That's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "The funny ad on the mamma that sucks milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their vouchers.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, Elvie's sucker works completely quietly, does not have wires or tubes and easily hides in the busthalter for feeding, which enables women to move freely, keep children, and even walk outside.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on this situation, "The Elvie sucker is so revolutionary that he demanded a bright and provocative representation.
After doing a parallel between the women who cure milk and the real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker would bring.
Elvie's sucker is not the first time in the news headers.
As part of the London Week fashion, the mother of two children appeared in a piano with this product when she showed her clothes by Marta's modeler Yakubowski.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Thai border
The number of delayed migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of crossings between the border has remained relatively constant in part because the hard rhetoric and policy of the Tramp administration have made the process of putting children in care.
Traditionally, most of the caregivers were the immigrants themselves without documents, and now they are afraid to threaten their own opportunity to stay in the country by offering responsibility for the child.
Risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be handed over to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, high director of the Bureau for Immigration and Customs Control, testified to Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had filed applications for the care of teenagers without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Often 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them are foreigners who have committed wrongdoing.
So we continue to persecute these people,” said Mr. Albens.
According to shelter workers, to deal more quickly with children's affairs, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear before the court within a month of detention, not in 60 days, as they used to.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing rather than come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who have no right to shelter by court will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression, may result in violent or escape attempts.
Lawyers argue that these problems are increasing in higher institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological situation of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to our friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw the troops immediately.
In addition, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Waled Al-Mualem, urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been in war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also worked as the Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the control of terrorism, so "there will be appropriate treatment."
"They must go away immediately and not put the conditions," he declared at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that "the war of terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue the "this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territory" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has placed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, and they are basically teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who fight against President Bashar al-Asad.
In a war - devastated country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created the right conditions for their return, and he also accused "some Western countries" that those who spread unreasonable fears that prevented refugees from turning back.
"We have called on an international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We see attempts to politicize a humanitarian problem."
The U.S. and the European Union warn that Syria would not assist in restoring the country until the political agreement between Asaad and the opposition to an end of war had been made.
UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create the buffer zone around Idlib, the last great host of rebels, made it possible to continue political negotiations.
The Russian Turkish agreement has prevented the vast offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia from residing in the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "child terms" and hoped that military action would be directed against jihadists, including the Al-Qaida Front An-Nusr fighters, who would be "disappeared."
UN Emisar Staffan de Mission hopes to shortly convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government representatives and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem put forward the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "the review of articles of the valid constitution," and warned against interference.
Why the Trump Will Be Reopened
According to this logic, the Trump may be re-selected in 2020, if, as many liberal spectators are expected, it does not make up the full - time authority after scandal and impistence.
No doubt it would be the most dramatic end of the presidency all the time!
At present, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of watchers in the raid has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million viewers in a time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the program The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the rating of 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Nile Ber, the performing producer of the "Last candidate" drama on the ABC channel about the state secretary, who becomes president after a destructive attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist writer and author of the book "Look at Funny Points: and a few hard truths about entering the Hollywood club" offers another theory.
She remembered the trip to the Boston taxi before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her he would vote for the Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's ridiculing me," he said, "that's what Mrs. Skowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are able to determine the future of Roe's case against Wade, the possibility of reunification families of immigrants and the state of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch six hours when a group of experts talks about the use of Bob Woodwood "fine knowledge" sources for his book, Paul Manafort from the skin of the ostrich for $15,000, and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy, published by Stormy Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the former.
"The feeling of realistic show is partially linked to the fact that you are being reconciled every night to something new," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the Llombard Stars, about the rotations in the actorial warehouse and the day-to-day stimulus of the Tramp show (NFL conflict, support by Kim Chen Ina).
If you allow yourself to miss at least one episode, you can hopelessly stand back.
When I met Mr. Flace this week at his house on the north coast of Kauai, there was a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he sat at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not when Brett Kavano put before the Senate Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on the hair.
"I remember when we used to make all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I took it as a joke, but they seem to be right."

External spending in the hardest intermediate elections at Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there are additional cash flows, because through the review of the electoral districts, two valid congressmen are being summoned for one chair.
In the struggle for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won another district in the additional elections last spring.
The Lemb stands against another valid congressman, the Republican of Keith Rotfs, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely incompatible with the new 17th.
The maps were recycled after, in January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old boundaries of the districts were in favour of the Republicans, contrary to the Constitution.
Pre-election races in the new 17th Region caused a rigorous opposition between the financial subdivisions of the major parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for Congress Elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The Lemb's name became very well-known in Pennsylvania after a minimum advantage in the 18th district during the extra elections in Congress in March, which were used by the general public.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in this area.
Political experts gave little advantage to democrats.
In the United States, El Salvador was reconsidered for China’s support, but it was reconsidered.
The diplomats reminded Washington’s weak opposition to the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously maintained Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varel, and before he had also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners had expelled staff hired by the Trump Organization.
The government department decided to revocate U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition”, stated the Spokesperson of the Department of Geser Noyert early this month.
However, only El Salvador, which received about $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, and social and economic support, was considered.
The proposed fines for cutting down financial aid and targeting visas would be painful to this Central American country, with its high unemployment and killing rates.
According to the internal councils, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity, which took place last year, and was assessed as a step forward in efforts to contain the flow of immigrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking representatives of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and actually the issue of Sanctions against El Salvador stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to address a conference that is scheduled to take place in mid-October in order to indicate that the administration considers this event to be very important.
At the same time, three American messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, since there were no new reports or punishments on the part of Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a representative in the White House, refused to comment on the details of internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under anonymity.
The information they provided confirmed an outside analyst, close to the administration, which was also anonymous.
Learn History
The next problem may be the report of the special prosecutor Robert Muller about possible interference with justice by the Tramp, as well as strong evidence of why it is available in the public information currently available.
As part of its investigation, Muller is reported to check the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our voting system from Russia.
If the influence in Congress becomes different, the Temple will have to report to the congresses, just as before the voters and, ultimately, the one - party.
There's a lot of "if," and I don't want to say that the fall of the Trump is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d’état against Hitler if only West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the possibility of avoiding bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such critical moments, and the unrestrained movement of democracy hastens or slows.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these breaking moments.
What will we do if the Tramp releases the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person on whom Mr. Mueller's destiny depends?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since this paper had reported that last year he had been proposing secretly to record his conversations with the President and sharing his reasoning on the inconsistencies of the Trump position.
Rosenstein described the information in The Times as inaccurate.
"How do we react if the investigation of the case against Brett Kavano, which recently started the FBI, is not sufficiently careful or honest, or if the candidature of Kavano is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite convincing accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the middle term for those members of Congress that will be able to bring the Tramp to account?
If we fail these trials, democracy will face bad times.
But I believe we're not going to go, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that once occupied my Embassy house.
She survived, Immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to ignite Saturday candles on the table with the swastika.
Having that legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future?"

Graham Dorrans with Greengers is looking forward to meeting the Vienna Rapid.
Reingers takes the Rapide to Thursday after a striking niche in Spain in a game with Villarreal in the beginning of this month of victory over Austrians will provide the Scottish Club with a good chance to get out of the G League group of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the knee, he was able to play for the first time in the season for his team only in the Villarreal, which ended with the count of 2:2. But he thinks that the FC Reingers could use this as a temple to achieve more.
"To us it was a good outcome, because Villarreal is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hopes of getting at least something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but in general, nothing can be considered a fair result.
In the first time, the opponents were better, but after a break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday there will be another major opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, our future rivals showed a good outcome in their last game, but we can count on support for the fighters.
The past year, of course, was difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself, but now the situation was normalizing.
We have a great warehouse, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can go further, leave the past season and succeed."
Women Lost Sleep because of Fear of Pension Savings
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize self-care, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the research of Nationwide said that they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of those interviewed talked about it to children.
"People want them to be cared for by a family member, but they don't have to talk about this," said Holly Sneider, vice president of the Nationwide National Insurance Unit.
That's where we've got to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not report your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining cost.
Involve a financial consultant, he may provide advice on how to cover appropriate expenses.
Funding sources for long - term care include traditional insurance policy, hybrid policy accumulation of life insurance or self - securities at the expense of your own funds (a condition that you have money).
Prepare carefully legal documents that will help you avoid legal tensions in advance.
Prepare trust for a representative who will control your health care and ensure that experts do your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
It is also advisable to establish trust in money.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you are incapable of doing so.

Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported by government officials, but the number of victims could increase.
As a result of the departure from the system of communication, officials involved in humanitarian relief are unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Regence, a district north of Pala, which is near the 7.5-point quake epicenter.
After the disaster, 16,000 people evacuated from Pala.
Let us consider a few basic facts about the city of Pala and the Dongal Regence on the island of Sulaves.
Palu, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, is located at the end of the narrow gulf on the western coast of the island of Sulawis, with a population of 379,800, according to 2017.
When an earthquake caused the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a register stretching more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulaves.
According to the 2017 register, there are approximately 299,200 people in the administrative region located in the lower province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the Dongal coastal region.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morolav, the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Pala and Dongal have suffered tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the Tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dongal, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg in northern Sumatra caused tsunami, which struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, in early April, a series of major earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 millenniums struck south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused the tsunami that collapsed on the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 points was recorded.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points clashed one of the Mantawai islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami to a height of 10 meters, resulting in the destruction of tens of villages and the death of about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Poddjayah Registry in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic, linked to the fact that people have not yet been able to forget the devastating earthquake and the tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombo in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed numerous buildings, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.

In Indonesia, the earthquake caused tsunamis, killing hundreds of people
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawes on Friday.
A 7.5 - point magnetic earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks and power supply have gone off the line, and the number of victims can increase in the next days.
The earthquake took place near the center of the island of Sulaves, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video that spreads in social networks shows the moment that hit the catastrophe.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami set ashore.
Federal accusers demand a rare death penalty for suspected in a terrorist in New York City.
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Saifulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist in New York City, resulting in eight deaths, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October 30-year-old Saips riding a rented picapa at Home Depot travelled to a bicycle road along the highway in West Said, Lower Manhattan, and began to beat down cyclists and pedestrians that had happened to him on his way.
According to a report about the intention of obtaining execution in the South State of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers have to prove that Saips "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries.
According to judicial materials, each of these points of accusation involves the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Jury filed Saipov's charges in 22 counts, including eight murder charges for the purpose of a trial that federal accusers usually charge in cases involving organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers who described Saipa's crime as “horrible, cruel and malicious”, this attack was the result of "real planning and predetermined thinking."
Saipov, who suffered injuries, damaged or killed by Seiful Habibullatchević, was caused by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferrody, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnukco, as described in the intention report.
Five dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time in the South of New York, a criminal case that is punishable by death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug providers, and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the federal death penalty was carried out in New York in 1953, a couple of Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs were executed after they were sentenced to conspiracy for the benefit of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the judicial materials of Saipus, the native Uzbek, did not demonstrate the reproach of conscience in the next days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he did not regret what had been done.
According to the accusation of Saipus, the authorities told him that he had been inspired to carry out an IIDL attack, which he had watched on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not admit that he was guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saippa, said that they were "wonderfully disappointed" by this decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and imprisoning permanent imprisonment without the possibility of release will only increase the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," said Patton.
Saipov’s defense party had also previously asked the accused not to try the death penalty.
Parliamentary deputy from the Conservative Party believes that NAYELA FARADJA needs to be appointed responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during an act of protest at the Conservative Party, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the people's army."
The former leader of the Party for Independence of the United Kingdom stated that politicians should be "sufficient to the pressure" of the Europeans, because one of the parliamentary deputies of Teresa May proposed his candidature to hold negotiations with the EU.
The Deputy from the Conservative Party Peter Bown said at the Burjingham march that the United Kingdom would be "would have come out" if Mr. Faraj was the secretary of Brexit.
Attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile its deep-separated rows further attracted the fact that the conservative party's conservative party has joined the special protest action in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that it will not leave any attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite negative reactions, and will make Europeans and leiborists to choose between what she suggests and chaos.
At the rally Leave Means Leave in Solikhal, Mr. Bown stated that he wanted to "retreat Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraju to get out of the shadow and to take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were to answer, we would have left," he said.
Wellingbore's parliamentary deputy added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars, not to subordinate.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion changed, "The idea that the British changed their minds and didn't want to come out is absolutely irrelevant to reality."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also at the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it does not support our party and our activists, who actually walk in the streets and fight for votes of the voters.
"Please leave Chequers and start listening."
In her address to Teresa May, she added, "The Prime Ministers retain their position when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should be pressured if they were to give up the 2016 referendum decision.
"This is now the question of trust between us, our people and our political elite," he declared.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say they won't get away with it."
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, which is going to betray the Brexit idea, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to the victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become independent, self-respectful, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opponents passed through Birbingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
A number of activists were scattered by the Conservatorys v. Brexit when they started the group with these weekends.
The Leiborist Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives because, after the opening of the conference, their party program caused security problems.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technology needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a full fare.
There's nothing good at Brexit," he added.
Warren is planning to "seriously think" about the presidential bathing.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November she would " seriously think about the presidential bathing."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general meetings in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about its future.
Vorren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, chatted in November for a second term against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Deel, who was a co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered a major candidature that can overcome Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, her 36th meeting with the voters in the format of the general congregations since the Trump took office.
The attendant asked her if she planned to participate in the election of the president.
Vorren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington to do government work, and there's a woman on his forehead."
Arrested suspected of murder from the firearms basketballist "LSU Thaigers" Sims
At the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, on Saturday, they reported that on Friday they arrested the suspected murder of a firearm basketballist, Veida Sims.
The Baton Rouge police office announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dhiton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east.
On Friday, they published video shootings and asked for help to identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot by the University of Sautern on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims has received a gunshot wound in the head and as a result of his death," stated on Saturday to journalists 247sports Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul.
Wade gave up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to be at the crime scene, had arms with him, and fired at Wade Sims.
Simpsona was arrested without incident and was taken under guard at the police office of East Bayon County.
Simus, who was 6 feet and 6 inches and who was in the Junior League, grew up in Bathon Rouge, and he played 32 star games in the last season with 10 stars and, on average, he spent 17.4 minutes on the field, he picked 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Gran Prie Russia: Lewis Hemilton cut back in the struggle for the title of the world after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fettel.
From the time on Saturday, when Valtaire Bottas left behind Lewis Hemilton, it became clear that Mercedes’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start with a pul-consumer, and he almost missed Hemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fetthel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
The fettel went to the pit-step first and left Hemilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to decide.
The pilot of the Mercedes team went through another circle and left behind Fettel, but Hemilton blew himself into the leaders after a certain wheel manoeuvre, leaving Ferrari's driver reluctantly out of the inner space because of the risk that he would be compressed after double manoeuvre had succeeded in breaking forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstaphen started from the back of the grid and stayed at the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
He would lead most of the race because he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish and move Kimi Rakeconen from four.
In the end, he stopped at pit-step on the 44th circle, but he couldn't increase the pace by the last eight, so Rakeconen sat on the fourth seat.
'It's a tough day,' because Walter's laid out on all the weekends and showed frankness when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
Hemilton said, "The team has done an exceptional job to get first and second place."
The Body’s Language Did Not Be Happy
In the vengeance on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Finstein for her firm position that she did not disclose the contents of the letter by Christine Blaise Ford, which accuses the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano of sexual violence.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence of Ford before the Legal Committee of the Senate, but instead expressed his view of events in the Senate, which he said demonstrated human "feeling, disgusting and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the marvelous things that have taken place in the last few days in the Senate, is the anger, you see the wicked people who are demonstrating selfishness, abomination and lying," he said.
"You're looking at the publications and the public information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you share the information?
Think of her answer... and have you announced the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't declare it."
Wait a minute.
We've announced?... no, we haven't announced," he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Fainstein received a letter with a detailed presentation of the charges made by Ford v. Kavano, and in early September its contents were released, but Fainstein denied that the leakage of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't disclose the information I received from her," declared Finstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this secret, and I didn't break my promises."
But her objection seems to be displeased with the president who commented on the Saturday rally, "I'll tell you, the language of her body was not impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone stay worse."
Continuing to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual violence, the President assumed that democrats used charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return authority in any necessary way.
You see the folly, the disgusting thing, the one they're going to be offended to get power and control," - Mediaite quotes the President's words.

Aviadispenser died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
Aviadispertcher in Indonesia was declared a hero after he was able to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the price of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after a severe earthquake caused by the tsunami on the island of Sulaves on Friday.
Strong underground impetus continues to shake the area, and many people are under the siege of the city of Palu.
But in contrast to their colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the remote tower, which was very hot, at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri airport in Pala.
He remained in place to make sure that the flight of 6321 Batik Air aircraft, which at the time was on the aerial landing strip, had safely lifted himself up into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was ruining.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Air Supply Company, Johannes Seraite, stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to get him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the number of victims can reach thousands, as the disaster relief agency claims that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi, and Bootong is limited.
"The number of victims can grow, because many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the Soutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The waves that reached six feet [6 m] were devastated by the city of Pala, where mass burials would pass on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver help and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute a quick help to bring bodies.
Clear water is not enough.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN, "The Red Cross of Indonesia hastens to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it's going to be a lot worse."
President Joco Video of Indonesia arrived in Pala on Sunday and said to the military in the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?"
Early this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on Lombo, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
Air Niugini reported that after the plane crashed into the lagoon, one man disappeared
Avia - communicating flight in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person has disappeared from the loose, even though it has previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the drowning plane.
At Air Niugini, it was said that a Saturday state was not able to find one passenger.
Airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
In the airline, it did not respond immediately to the request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save other passengers and teams after the plane fell on the water while trying to land at the Chuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon near the landing strip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew through a landing strip.
A U.S. passenger, Bill Janes, said that the plane was flying very low over the ground.
"That's very good," said Janice.
Janice told me that he and others managed to get to an accidental exit on a tone plane while they were on a belt in the water.
He told me that the stewardesss had panic and shouted, and that he had a light head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers working near the refurbishment of the dock also helped to deliver people to shore before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in air accidents associated with PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
A U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roolett witnessed as an expert in the field of operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury members how he used mobile phone records to reproduce the 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Tellis and Jesse Chambers' 19-year-old victim on the night of murder.
Roolett, according to The Clarion Ledger, told him that he had received data on where he was from a few mobile phones that showed that Tellys was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claim.
When data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was at Sanford's peacap, Senford said he was "he was lying because my peak was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The phone records indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Roolett explained that some time after the death of Chambers Tallis, he removed text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," said Gail.
The defense should be given its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hipp-hop?
Trio hip-hop-respondents want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group of Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature -- has gone away political ideas and struggles for solving social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artisans such as The Fugees and the Common have recently witnessed the resurgence of this trend in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
In New York City, the nanny filed a couple for liberation with a "racist" message.
In New York City, a nanny filed a couple for disqualification after receiving an incorrect message from her mother with a complaint that she was "one black."
Marriage denys that they're racial, comparing the lawsuits with the winning.
Lincy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw the new nurse, Gisel Morris, who came to her first day in 2016, black.
"No, THAT THlS THEMNOSKER," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a report.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Miss Maurice twice.
As New York Post reports, after acknowledging her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Miss Moris, and she said that their previous African nanny, who was an African woman, had been doing a bad job and that she was waiting for a babysitter from the Philippines instead.
Miss Maurice paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now submits a couple to the court, hoping to receive compensation for the payment of the salary she would have received in six months of work with the spouse she had first hired, although she had no contract, and she was to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said to Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racial, Maurice’s release was a wise decision because they feared that they could not trust her after offense.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racial,' said the Post her husband, Joel Plasco.
'But would you have left your children with a man who was treated roughly, even if it wasn't intentionally?'
Your baby?
NIGHT."
Comparing the claim with the "suggestion," Plasco said that his wife had born a child just two months ago, and "not yet recovered."
"Would you have retaliated after that?
It's a bad act," added an investment banker.
Although the court is still under review, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple in social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that the readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bond Karen Jankel's daughter, who was born almost immediately after the book had agreed to be printed, said, "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's ridiculous, because we know of the huge success that the story of Padington has achieved."
In telling her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, he was optimistic about his job being rejected, and she shared how she felt at the 60th anniversary of the publication at the same time "joy and sadness," because Father died a year ago.
With regard to Padington, which she described as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was so real to him as a child of his own, because when children reach something, we're proud of them, even though they're not theirs, not our winners.
I think he looked at the success of Padington like this.
Although Padington was creating his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was transferred to two hospitals named Louis Pastera in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Nad called regularly, said that everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"And then Над called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and I must say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tassie, darling, I love you so much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors gave her the cure to keep her heart fighting gradually ceased to act and got out of the body.
She died some time before they turned it off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what's going on at this time.
I couldn't cry, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should've really kept myself in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was burning for the loss of her daughter, went to the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep empathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have experienced grief leave postcards to prevent suicide on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sheron Davis and Kelly Hamfris are left on the Wallian Bridge postcards with telephone numbers for which people can look for support, as well as messages that would inspire them.
Ms. Davis Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, a 45-year-old girl living in Lydney, told me that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
"Everybody knew him for a smile.
They always said this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "because he was in the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body after he had committed suicide.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards, "that people knew that there are people to whom they could go and talk, even if it's just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you need to talk."
Miss Hamfris, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who had lived with her for 15 years shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, that he's depressed or that," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed it changed."
And on Christmas day, he was depressed, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't see anything in their eyes."
She said that his death had become a huge trauma for them, but they had to survive it, "It's devastating.
We're going to have a family.
But we have to keep living and fight."

The future Bretta Cavano hangs on the hair: the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought that if we could get what we asked, -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached some agreement, -- said Saturday, Mr. Flake, and added that he was afraid that the committee was "solving" in the background of the indistinct loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavano and his Republicans want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Their reluctance is due to time.
The intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will make their attempts to take place through the election of their own person to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's rule and who met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, the vote will take place.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice President Mike Pens to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidate for the office of the Supreme Court.
During Kima's reign, the number of surgeons from North Korea has "slowed"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of escapers from North Korea to South Korea reduced, declared a South Korean legislator.
Pyong Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of Union of the Republic of South Korea, stated that last year the number of survivors was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers transporting illegals now demand more money to do so.
The Pyongyangs held back from public comments.
Most of the survivors from North Korea eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans were said to have crossed the border illegally after the conclusion of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the intercessors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally in warfare, has been markedly improved in the past months.
At the beginning of this month, two leaders met in Phenyani and discussed the issue of denuclearization, which had become a stalemate.
This was the case after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Ina in Singapore, where they agreed to cooperate in common traits on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yon-Ho in the background of the sanctioned accusations of the United States lacking progress since.
"Without confidence in the United States, we can't be sure of our country's security, so there can't be any unilateral disarmament under these circumstances," said Ri Yon-Ho in his presentation at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Cavano "isterary" and says that he's not good for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelos named the candidate for the position of Judge Brett Kavano of the Supreme Court “isterial” and stated that he was unprecedented for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking all the time that if a woman had ever done so, she would be called "hissterical," "Pelosey commented on her response to the Kavano witness to the Legal Committee of the Senate in Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavano acted very emotionally, sometimes almost shouted and cries out, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation," organized by liberals, who were angry that Gillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential elections.
According to Pelosi, Kavano’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his biased attitude toward democrats.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and Democrats, he will take his own candidature," she said.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to announce the Kavano impistence, if his fault was confirmed, and if most of the Democrats in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say, if he doesn't tell the truth of Congress or the FBI, it's not just for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Now Kavano is a U.S. Court of Appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of the Kavano against the law "On affordable medical care" or "Rou v. Weida" because he's considered to be a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the issue of the approval of the office of Kavano, he waived the question as to whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now it's not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we'll say how great it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that contained accumulated months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We're crying when we're angry," Miss Stanem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who worked as executive director somewhere and was very helpful to me, said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own technique, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to the speaker, "You might think I’m sad and crying.
And I am evil."
And after that, she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears are considered to be a permissible way of getting angry in part because they're perceived differently.
One of my most frequent memories of my first job in the office, mostly in men, was when I once wept from an unspeakable anger, and the older woman, the indecisive manager I always had, grabbed me for the collar and pulled me to the staircase cage.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy to get you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out of celebrity on a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not vote for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she laughed at me 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates were already involved in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "The White Snow and Seven Dwarves."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in the congregation, so she promised that she would not take part in the race if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her adherents, who had spared $1,000 in support of men, only gave her $250.
"They think I'll be given a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a talk and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was enthusiastic -- thankful to the people who supported her, disappointed by the system, which made the collection of money very difficult and forced the voters to look different from the members of the Chamber of Deputies as well as the viciousness of sexism -- and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Miss Schroeder the press response.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
So I was still thinking about what they're going to write on my super grave plate?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S. - China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-C. trade war were desperate, and although far before it ends, long-term differences between countries can benefit Beijing.
The U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot this year by taxing the major Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
This week’s biggest situation has been the result of new tariffs at a total cost of $200 billion (150 billion pounds) that actually pays half of all the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently putting the mito in the amount of five to ten percent per American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to taking similar measures in the United States, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the possibility of fulfilling that promise in the near future.
Forcing Washington to retreat means accepting the demands, but for President C Jinpin of China, the U.S. public worship is too shameful.
However, as experts believe, if Beijing takes the right advantage of the situation, pressure in a trade war from the United States can give China the advantage in a long-term perspective by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a drastic economic decline in any of the countries, and it is in fact a greater threat than the observers had previously recognized," said analyst Ebigail Grayce, who deals with Asian issues at the Centre for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister stated that Syria was "prepared" for the return of the refugees.
In Syria, it is claimed that they are ready for the voluntary return of refugees and are looking for help in restoring a land devastated by war, which lasted over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Waled Al-Mualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild the terrorist areas so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their everyday lives and limited their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muallem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept help to restore a war-breaking country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries supporting rebellion.
Europe fortifies the victory on the Raider Cube in Paris.
The European team conquered the Ryder Cube in 2018 when winning the U.S. team with a total of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for six times and has not won the Cup Raider tournament since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when a Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, took 14.5 points to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who tried most of the tournament, struck his first long-range impact on the 16th par-3 hole in the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Golfist Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of the four players that ever went with a 5-0-0 from the beginning of a modern tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated with the count of 5:4 by the lowest rating player in the European team of Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dastin Johnson, who takes the first staircase in the world rating, succeeded in counting 2:1 Jan Poulter of England, who might have participated in the Cup of Ryder's Pole last.
Hispanic Serhio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cubca, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most of the tournament all the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"Only I don't cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad to get the cup back.
It's a job for the team, and I'm glad I've been able to help," said Garcia after the victory in Europe, without restraining his emotions.
He conveys the estaphet to his fellow countryman, John Rem, who on Sunday defeated American legend of Tyger Woods Golf in a lonely game with count 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of the victory over Tyger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record on the Ryder Cup tournament 13-21-3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 Major tourists, only going to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. congregation has tried to reach the Feb zone for all weekends, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high - class golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after a grudging talk, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a short dominance over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking a hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Tournament Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
We shouldn't disapprove of them.
We lost."
Actual tide information: Reducing concentrations in Pinellas, Manat, and Sarasota County
The recent report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the growth of red - colored microorganisms in some parts of the Tampa Gulf.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the conditions of rich blossoms, reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasot, Charlotte, and Collier, indicate a decline in concentration.
The bloom of red microorganisms extends about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the southern districts of Li.
They can be found in about 10 miles off the coast of the Hillsborough district, but they are less than last week.
The red tide was also observed in the area of Pasco.
Last week, the average concentration was reported in the Pinellas district and in its coastal zone, concentrations from low to high coastal areas in the Hillsboro district, high concentrations in the Manat district, high concentrations in the Sarasot district and its coastal zone, average concentrations in Charlotte, high concentrations in the Lee district and its coastal zone, and low concentrations in the Collier district.
In Pinellas, Manat, Sarasot, Lee, and Collier districts, breathing organs continue to be reported.
Such reports were not reported in northwest Florida last week.
