Named number of newly recruits ready for departure from Ukraine
The official representative of the People ' s Police of the Luhan People ' s Republic (LNR) said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbas.
He said that Kiev was planning “to complete some units”.
“The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian military, the mass dismissals have led to a low number of units”, said Maročko, quoted by “RIA Newsty”.
He also did not delete that real numbers of Ukrainian troops could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched a so-called anti-terrorist operation (APO), which was later replaced by the Joint Force (UP).
This measure was expected to enhance the role of Ukrainian forces in resolving the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbasse was exacerbated by the assassination of the head of the DNR, Alexander Zakarchenko.
The DNR authorities have defined what has happened as a terrorist.
Several persons involved in the explosion were detained during the investigation of the criminal case.
Preliminaryly, they confirmed that the diversion was organized by Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British MIDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
The British Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jeremy Hunte, compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivating members of the community.
Such a statement was made by the diplomat at the visit of the ruling Conservative Party to Birmingham on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union prevented anyone from leaving it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not be reduced, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to flee from captivity," said the Minister.
He added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, the British Prime Minister Teresa May stated that the Brexit talks had become impasse.
So she commented on the results of the EUROSOMIS informal summit in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 on the basis of a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will work together after London has left the community.
Furthermore, the question of the Irish border remains open.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission had previously filed with the Director General, Tesla Ilon Mask, because of his Twitter report on the possible purchase of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy all stocks on a fixed price of $420.
The value of the stock in $420 was alleged to be “due to the importance of this number in the culture of marijuana”, previously reported by the Bloomberg agency, with reference to the co-director of the Security Division of Stephen Paykin Commission.

Grant to Sochi: Anglag, Russian pain and return to Quyata
For the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing pain.

The outcome of our meeting with autoproducers should be in the foreseeable future as the creation of the Russian Formula-1 pain that has no analogy in the world, said Dmitry Kozak.
We have to provoke our autoproducers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible in such a time frame.
I think the more real time is for the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the "Formul-1" under Russian license was a Marusi team.
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors ready to invest in the establishment of a domestic team in the World Championship in the Formula-1 class.
I know that there are road sport lovers in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in the formation of the Russian "Formula-1" team, he said.
"We are willing to support them morally.
Let's hope that we'll have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came into being, among other things, because Sochi had this infrastructure.”
Tomorrow, "Socha Autodrom" is waiting for an ambulance.

Look, even the rostrum's qualifications were practically filled, said the vice-premier.
I can say that this year's benefit increased by 72% compared to last year.
That's a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the use of the Sochi Autodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak hasn't reached the main theme of the day for Russian autosort lovers, the return of Daniel Quata to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season,
He is a promiscuer of great hope.
Next year, for the first time in history, the Formula-1 will be able to take part in two major Russian pilots.
Although the further destiny of Sergei Sirotkin in the Royal race is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he has taken 18th place in the qualifications of Gran Pro Russia.
Let's hope that in the next season, our main pilots will be more than this year, Dmitry Kozak said.

Trump told me about "love" in Kim Chen Yen.
The U.S. and DPRK leaders have barely fallen into one another's love, and Donald Trump is a joke.
The U.S. President Donald Trump noted a good joke about his success in the face of the North Korean crisis.
As a result of mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now corrected their relations so much that they are hardly in love with each other, the President of the United States has noted.
The owner of the White House recalled that he had adopted the North Korean problem from the previous administration as a major challenge in foreign policy.
The Trump noted that Barak Obama's team had started relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even be called to the country's leadership -- it was simply not that it was not taken off the tube.
The United States and the DPRK were on the threshold of the war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “pretty letters”, noted the Temp.
The Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he too was "grim" to Kim Jung Yin, which was mutually reciprocal.
Now, however, their relationships have changed so much that the leaders have “loved each other”.
At the same time, Trump asked that his words not be literally understood and warned that the U.S. media interpreted them as incompetent.
The trump pointed out that Pyongyang had recently ceased nuclear and missile tests, as well as closed military areas.
These are the merits of his administration, the American President is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump was politely referring to Kim Chen Yin from the UN Genasamble rostrum.
The Temple thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nizzoi called for the “mosk language of Ukrainian” to be removed.
The Ukrainian child writer and championer of Larisa Nizza's mother tongue called for the removal of the Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language from Ukraine.
To do so, it offers a Ukrainian product, a “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
Nizza shared the Ukrainian publication Ombudsperson with her considerations on “the desirability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is even eating and continues to grow.
In time, Ukrainians are “healthy” from that “mosk language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian speech had been widely used in television and radio before, but it had almost disappeared in public space.
In the opinion of Nizza, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language are, in her view, merely “the expansion of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Previously, Nizza shared the experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-language regime” in the Carpathian child camp, to which she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookstore, one of which was associated with her in Russian.
When Nizza didn't get her, she screwed up a girl's shower.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called “lingual schizophrenia”, calling on Ukrainians to abandon the Russian letters even in writing the names.
Recently, Nizza stated that the name “Russia” had been stolen by Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service did not escape the wrath of the writer: when she heard the conversations of the staff with each other in Russian, she scandaled and left by slamming the door.
The man’s conversation was suspended, and it brought fruit
Denis Kulakov protector on the victory over Arsenala (2:1) in the Russian championship of the Ninth Turbul.

"I think we wanted to win more," quotes Kulakov, an official Urala site.
"Such a complicated game was played, and a serious male conversation was interrupted, and it brought its fruits: two balls were killed and not missed.
"You've missed a few matches because of the damage you got at the beginning of the month.
How did it feel today?"
"If you've had 90 minutes, then it's okay!
I actually felt good.
Maybe at the end a little beach of strength so nothing's happening.
Yes, Dr. and Physiotherapist Vladimir Anatoljević Gasnov led me to the game, for which they thank you so much!
"What about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's no secret to anyone that after winning and rebuilding, it's easier, and the mood in the collective is good.
Now we've got a white strip, although we had a black one first.
We must continue in the same spirit and enjoy the supporters."
"Did you miss the game for the time that you didn't go out on the field?"
"There's something like that, a little bored, because there's really a bad situation.
But once again, thank the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting them on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and we rejoiced in the hospitals.
And the rest of it is secondary."

The Head of the Committee of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs, Constantine Cosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not preclude it from becoming a turning point in the perception of the FM as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric that we have been almost used to in recent years with regard to Russia has now been in a more deterred order,” stated the Senator in an interview published by the Russian newspaper on Sunday.
He explained that, in previous years, the RF, at times “had been identified as one of the three major threats to humanity, along with the Ebola fever, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any event, in a group of Western countries that had expressed itself unanimously.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the theme of Russia was virtually absent”.
“If I carefully review the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly,” noted the politician, noting that Russia “was more than a wall of tennis balls.”
The Head of the Saufed Committee does not preclude a trend that, in his view, “will allocate to the current session [UNGENA], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, two, three.”
"I do not preclude that the current session could in some sense be turning," said Kosachev, "there are many examples of how Russia's connections move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Now, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be demanded over time,” added the parliamentarian.
This relates to what he believes to be “a perfect, healthy view of Russia as not just an inalienable participant in solving the global problems of modernity”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement will no longer move back, it's going to be moving forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important sense” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I have attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sergey Lavrov, and I have been very pleased to see that, if there is a year or two or five years ago, the Russian vision of the world, in large numbers, no one has been interested, the situation is different,” said the Chairman of the Committee of Sovfed.
In his view, this was due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which stands for the West, had no answers to questions on how to deal with the world's problems because of the apparent deficit of ideas in global space, the deficiency of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,” said Kosachev's confidence, emphasizing that in that sense, “the present session is a successful Russian delegation for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that Idlib will not have to use military force in the Syrian Province, stated by the Head of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Mualle.
He said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly address the issue of the withdrawal of militia from Russia ' s banned organization Gebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports “RIA Newsty”.
The Head of the Ministry also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the Territories east of Euphrates in the case of the Kurdish aspiration to separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that negotiations with the Kurdish forces of SDF had been good until the United States had interrupted.
On 17 September, Putin and President Rejep Erdogan of Turkey agreed to establish a demilitarized zone along the line of armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib by 15 October.
Terry led the Youth Team of Chelsea.
Previously it was reported that 37-year-old defender had negotiated the transition to Moscow Spartak.
According to the RT, referring to Mirror, former British collecting captain John Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
According to the source, a long-term player in the London Club will lead a team at the age of 23.

Remember, in September, Terry was close to the transition to Moscow Spartacus, but eventually abandoned that idea after talking to the family.
The first Vice-Speaker of the Supreme Council, Irena Heraszhenko, apologized to the convicted person at the RF for the “spienge” of Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for not being able to release him from the walls.
She said this in the video presentation to a political prisoner written before the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suschenko FSB.
She said that there was an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, whose participants declared a hungry protest for the release of Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural leaders, including well-known people, are starving, supporting Oleg Senzav, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview wherever the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, not demanding to exert pressure on the Kreml, to exert pressure on Putin with one requirement — the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin, and those children who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Krima,” said Heraszhenko.
She also expressed confidence that the trials would encircle every Ukrainian woman by making us “greeper, harder in the protection of the national interests of Ukraine, in the protection of each Ukrainian person, in the understanding of what good is and what evil is.”
Recall that correspondent of Ukrinform in France, Roman Suschenko, was detained by Russian forces on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying at the Directorate General of Minoбороna Intelligence.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suschenko to 12 years of strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found that verdict to be legal.
The Russian prisoners met the latest Ukrainian request prior to its phasing into the colony.

Wahtang Kikabize on Cancer Control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to deal with the cancer.
Unfortunately, the disease does not spare anyone, but the history of popular people about the victory over cancer gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wahtang Kikabize confessed that he was alive only because of his wife.
Many years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis that was pronounced as a sentence.
"I'm as if I've been hit by a hammer down the skull.
I fell down.
Lost orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
I couldn't hold the spoon there, I couldn't stand, I падed all the time.
We started analyzing, it turns out a bad case, the artery doesn't skip blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they told me that I had a big dwarf cyst in my head, and I had an emergency operation.
And during the operation, the doctors at the kitt saw the tumor, "Kicabidze told the "One." program.
The tumor has proved to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say good - bye to his house.
But the actor’s wife did not allow a living actor to be buried, and she believed that she would be able to cope with the disease and that she had not left the bed of a loved one for more than a year.
If Irena weren't, I wouldn't have been alive now.
Always when I had critical situations, it was like a rock," confessed the actor.
The acter was able to cope with the disease, and now he's happily living in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time the rumours of his sickness denies, and of the untimely end, which come into the Network.

The authorities called the amount of the golden parachute of the Crown Zamgubernator
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronez district of Yuri Agibolova was based on the regional law on public positions.
At the same time, the real amount of the “golden parachute” of a vrio official was several times less than that of the media.
Such explanations were provided to the regional government press service.
According to the law, Agibalov ' s salary is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press, the amount of one-time disbursement was less than the income tax of 223,892 roubles than the 1 million roubles of the media.
The governor has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His office is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and a one-time payment shall be made immediately after the dismissal of the post, explaining to the RIA Newsty Agency in the Government of the Field.
At the same time, Agibolova ' s prepaid pensions were suspended when it was assigned to the State and its salary did not change over the previous period.
The winner of the Governor's election to the Governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on 15 September.
Agibalov was released as a result of the expiration of the term of office of the head of the area.
Similarly, the credentials of other government officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram Nonsigarl published documents, of which it was assumed that Abigalova, who departed from the position of Vice Governor, had paid 23 salaries, and two days afterwards received a similar post without the gurio.
Deputy of the State of Justice called for schoolchildren to be told about the damage to masturbation
The first Vice-Chairperson of the Committee on Education and Science has a tentative position.
Based on his experience, he noted in an interview that adolescents in masturbation were provoking the harmful information they found on the Internet.
This is at the educational level and at the family level, adding a deputy.
Hennadiy Yeschenko, Deputy of the Lord of the RF (in interview of the Radio Station says Moscow):
In general sexual education, children need to do so by explaining the damage because there is a risk of a child's sexual health, both a boy and a girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the development of children is early enough, and there are still large scissors between their sexual abstinence and the possibility of formal contact between the sexes.
In the opinion of Yeschenko, the solution to the problem has been hampered by “changeness”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers are confronted with masturbation.
The deputy believes that lessons on the harm of masturbation are first and foremost among the schools of the “hyperurbanized” regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we're just not going to understand with you," said the professor.
Hennady Zeschenko - Acting Academic RAMN, member of the Presidency of RAMN, doctor of medical science, professor.

As a result of the tragedy, a number of cars failed under the asphalt, and two young people died on the ground from burns received.
AUG became the second popularity in Germany
The Antiimmigrant Alternate for Germany beats another record of popularity, and the Angels Mercel's ratings fall.
It appears that German residents have begun to be seriously struggling with immigration policies by Angels Mercel, which has made the country an avid target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest social surveys show that the Alternate Party for Germany is becoming increasingly popular and the position of the ruling block of Mercel and Zehophera is weakening.
This week 'AdG hit the next record, climbing the second line in the popular sympathy rating.
Right conservatives, with 17 per cent of popularity, were able to surround social democrats with about 16 per cent.
The gap in one percentage point can be cancelled into statistical errors, but it cannot be overlooked that a small group of Euroscoptic economists created in 2013 had become a major political force.
Leadership in general is still holding a control unit of CSC/CCD, with about 30 per cent.
However, there is a tendency to lose scores -- back in April, the Angela Mercell block was supported by four percentage points above.
The German Chancellor, headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth consecutive term, also declines.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are in support of Angels Mercel, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Additionally, greens (15 per cent), left (11 per cent) and liberals (10 per cent) were followed by social democracies.
Alternate evolution
The Alternate Party for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the 2013 Alternate Choice Group, which entered the Christian Democratic Union.
The group had initially become opposition to government courses, but at the first time it had only dealt with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU interaction.
However, the group opposed Germany ' s suspicion of weak EU economies and did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the country ' s full exit from the European Union.
Against the background of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the AGG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a complete party that took on a niche of Euroskeptics and began to criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
During the recent parliamentary elections in 2017, Angla was able to fly for the first time in Bundestag, with 94 deputy chairs (of 709).
Two representatives of Althernatives for Germany received a seat in the European Parliament.
Video published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens “nation of mobbers”
The Ukrainian TV leader of the political show, the author of two books, the Ostap Drozdov in a direct air, admitted that he regards his fellow country as a “folvan nation”.
They believe TV, and they don't read enough.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We haven't been trained in a culture of reading and practitioning texts since childhood," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Committee of the Independent has begun to combat literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kyiv authorities, prohibiting the import of 201 publications.

Canadians created a car in the case of apocalypse - driving magazine
Anyone who wants to buy this car can buy it.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it was already accepting applications for its new armoury.
Roshel Senator APC Bronevik
On the subject of the apocalypse, money is not just made by video game manufacturers, movie studios, and book editions.
Automobile companies are also learning a new niche for themselves.
So, Canada's Roshel Defence Solutions presented her apocalypse of the Senator APC.
Free of fantasies, engineers of this company create armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who, without special comfort but in full security, are placed in a whole-breeding bronecapsule.
This bunker, and otherwise the design will not be called, since its armouring level is in line with B7, is set on the ford Super Duty chassis of a powerful peak.
Its days, also armoured, can protect the capsule from undermining grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of the Apocalypse Senator APC
In order to prevent the passengers from harming even an explosive wave from a shell crashing near a car, a salon of a car is equipped with special depreciating chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and firefighting system.
The Roshel Senator APC vehicle is equipped with a night vision camera system, as well as a bronized tower on the roof.
There's no equipment in the car.
The front of the armoured apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC
In order to avoid the gravity of the armoured car, Roshel Senator APC was equipped with a 330-powered turbodisel engine of 6.7 litre, whose entire strength is transferred to four armoured wheels through a 6-step automated gearbox.

Named the time of the universe’s death
The universe has an estimated 140 billion years of age, 10 times the age of the world that is observed, about 13.8 billion years.
A study of the international team of scientists is put into the library of electronic preprites arXiv.org and is directed at publication in the Journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports Japan’s newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to such conclusions by observing the subaru telescope with the Hyper Suprime-Cam camera for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the world ' s energy-mass energy, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ¶CDM (
The Subaru Press Release of the Observatory notes that observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the accounting of the European Space Telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on the CDM parameters.
In July, scientists modelled the possible loss of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments to the effect that the world under review would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Disappearance.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about pension reform is delayed indefinitely
On Saturday in Moscow, a meeting of a general-federal initiative group was held against retirement age.
Representatives of 13 subgroups attended, with different language (all of them five language texts).
They decided to apply to the CIC for registration of a single proactive group and to ask the Russians: “You do not increase the age of old-age pension as of 1 July 2018 by which Russian citizens are entitled to a pension?”
The wording was registered by a Voloyear subgroup whose representatives did not participate in the congregation, but was considered to be the most simple and legal receptacle.
Most of the members of the meeting were supporters of the member of the Justice Russia, Elijah Sviridov (six subgroups) and CRCF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from Lower Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg, joined them.
Swiridov had previously said “Videomen” that the invitations had been sent to all initiators and that some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, head of the Volojedo subgroup (which was supported by another 15 subgroups), said, “Videomas”, that the invitations were not received and were not planned, “We didn't understand who the friend was, and who was the enemy.”
Dead Otis Rush, dirty singer.

Zinethula Bilaletdinov: Admiral created us with great problems.
The chief coach of the Ak Barsa Zinethula Bilaletdinov led the outcome of the regular CFC championship against Admiral (4:2).
"The wrong game was complicated.
The rival was worthy of war, creating great problems for us.

Ilon Mask will leave the head of the Board of Directors of Tesla
According to the agreement, Mr. Mask would have to leave the chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
At the same time, the businessman will retain the position of the principal executive director of the company, reports AFP with reference to the controller's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a $20 million fine.
Previously, the regulator filed a suit against Ilon Masca, who believed that he had misleaded Tesla investors, since the businessman had accepted the purchase of all the high price shares of the company - $420 for paper.
In the Loko match, the Achmat errors of Turbin were wooing like the horns of abundance.
The former judge of the Universe category, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of an arbitrator, Evgeny Turbin, at the 9th tour of the Russian Championship "Lokomotive" - "Ahmat" and examined the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you judge Eugenia Turbin in the Lokomotive-Ahmat match?
- I believe that arbitrator has confirmed his inappropriateness to the judges of the Russian Prime League.
I am amazed that in the meeting of the Spartacus fifth tour, Dinama, neither Turbin himself nor the JCI leaders have made a serious conclusion about his low qualifications.
The result has not slowed down in the ninth tour: errors in his actions, and private omissions of gross admissions have been spilled as a horn of abundance.
For example, for the 50th minute of the Eder Railway, it takes hands to the Achmata Defense of Rodolpho.
From a gate of eight meters, but Turbin doesn't put the toolbars.
- How do you estimate an episode involving Idova, who was 82 when the ball appeared to be in his hand?
- I think this was a deliberate game by the defender's hand in his penal area.
Turbin was next to the moment, well seen the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This was also the moment that the Reserve Judge Sergei Karasev had to see.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and the toolbars were not assigned.
That's why the score is distorted, and sports fairness has turned out to be crappy.
It was the same case when the judges on the concepts pushed out and buried the sports spirit.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin didn't decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest counsel who violated the rules in the fight against the Krykovjak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
Should we have shown the second Wormhole?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show up in the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of judges, that some teams put toolbars for violations such as the Episode with Idoba and somehow not.
What do you appreciate as a football player?
- Seeing what to understand under double standards.
It was a toolbar.
He wasn't given.
So the arbitrator doesn't give the second panel to the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge's watching who's playing.
This is the play of the Lockomotive Saturday, and the Akhmata has serious claims for the work of Turbin because the team was attacked.
Matt Damon played the raped judge Kavano at SNL startup.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretta Kavano, who was accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new Saturday Night Live season on the NBC television.
During a small sketch, the actor played the Kavano at the hearings in the Senate on the charges of rape.
The candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed experiences in a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Thus, Cavano repeatedly confessed his love of beer, but he said that he had never been drunk before he could.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself for rape, Kavano stated that he had been a virgin during those years.
These points were also played by Damon.
I just did a lot of drinking and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the drunkest virgin ever seen.
Everybody knows it," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Previously, Kavano was elected the U.S. Supreme Judge.
Barbra Streizand found in her cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand stated that the clones of her deceased dog are quite different from the original nursery.
"They don't look like them.
In fact, it looks like it, but it's impossible to clon the soul," a 76-year-old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Straizand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog Coton de Touréar, named Samantha, who had to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the cheehua breeding dog called Mido Milli (Mirasque Milly), who was called the world's smallest dog, cloned 49 times.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States considered the Russian naval blockade due to the supply of oil and gas
In the United States, the Russian sea blockade can begin to benefit from the world’s energy market.
The American authorities have been so keen to fight for success in the world’s hydrocarbon market that they are willing to resort to the Russian naval blockade, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of energy.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. MID, described the possibility of the sea blockade on the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not carry out the civil functions, including the implementation of natural resources policies.
Therefore, the Zinke ' s statement was entirely within the authority of his department, although it had not been deprived of political beauty.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that the U.S. naval forces had controlled the seaways in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply of the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continued to receive a lion share of its income from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, was the main motivation for the revitalization of Moscow in that region, as Zinka is sure.
The Minister explained that the United States continued to look forward to providing leadership in the world energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to shatter Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes -- an acceptable measure on that path -- believes Zinke.

Formula-1 Grant of Russia Gonka
Russia has a club that I'm following.
John Terry, former Chelsea captain and assembly of England, about why he visited the Russian Spartacus Championship (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm watching for.
I've been watching it very recently, and I'm curious to see it on the side.
I can't say I'm a chiller because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but my sympathy to Spartacus I have and I want to apologize for the decision I made, and I quote Terry's "Chelsey" website.
Remember, Rostov with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and Spartak was placed on the fifth line with 15 points in an asset.
The next tour, on 7 October, will be played with Enisseum, and Valeria Carpina's guardianship will be taken earlier by the day.
The dear violin was given to the lombard for the priceless
When the Lombard LBC Boutique and Loan man brought a violin for an old and unpredictable tool, the Lambard employee offered only $50.
But Dylan McDermitt's experienced shop manager suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked the expert for advice.
Here it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galiano and was estimated at $250,000.
One violin was estimated at $16-18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had been kidnapped by one of the residents of the city for some time, and the instrument had been reinstated to the lawful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin came to the man who gave it to the lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone in the Lombard violin will ask to play on her to make sure she really belongs to the client.
In the ninth tour of the RPL, we are awaiting an impressive opposition: Spartacus will be admitted at his Stadium at the Rostov Stadium under the leadership of Valerie Carpina, a human being, as we know, is not a stranger to the "National Team".
The special feature of this meeting is that the clubs now have an equal number of glasses -- 15, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving the far-reaching Zenit and in one eye from the "Crandar", which tomorrow plays with "Dinamo".
The red and white are now having a strip: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the League of Europe, Massimo Carrera's team suddenly flew "Rapidu" and recently left the house "Achmatu."
After derby with CSCA, which ended fairly, Spartacus, with a minimum account, played in the Chernomorec Cube, and it was early to say whether the most popular Russian club had approached the way out of the crisis.
Three consecutive matches couldn't win, but they don't know five matches.
Let's see if Carpin's going to be able to extend the unrealized series with such a game of principle.
The previous Carpin’s “Rostow” meeting with Spartacom ended in favour of the capital team.
Start at 19:00.

The translator compared the mentalities of the Russians and the Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but few, differences do not play a significant role in understanding.
On the International Translation Day, on 30 September, a professional synchronist, Barbel Saxe, explained this.

And in the future, Saxe, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, it doesn't make sense to try to ignore it.

The Lord helped Siberia today.
Vitzia's main coach, Valerie Bellov, on the Siberia (3:4) defeat in the regular CHR championship match.
"Collega talked about Siberia's champions, and I want to celebrate our championships," he says, "Belva's official site, "The Vitaza."
"I hope they will support the same, because now almost every game is full of stadium, a great atmosphere.
The Lord must have helped Siberia today because they've already made a big mistake, especially our leaders.
In fact, the Micro match 0:3 of our leading leaders have lost, so it was hard for us to get this match, even though there were moments.
But still, I'll take the blame for it.
Because they probably missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was another team."
"It's a fabulous cucumber."
The audience is indignant by the choice of Agutin on Golos show.
Golos 60+ is accusing Leonid Agutin's mentor in a "blasphemous cucumber and a silly pitch."
When he learned from his father Nicholas Agutina’s first note in blind listening, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not return to the performer.
But son’s feelings were overthrown, and he chose a relative to his team.
At that time, many thought it was a joke, but they pardoned the mentor's inadvertentness at the first stage.
But the "silk" is prolonged, and the star's father is absolutely unreasonably taking the place of more dignified performers.
Now the audience are not ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the show audience, were resented by the cumulative and frank pushing our relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would be able and conscientious not to pull to the end of her dad's entirely the first place," Irena Petrovska and Xenia Larina had been reasoning on the TV program.
In the meantime, for his father, Leonid Agutin "saw" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nicolas Petrovic whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what the audience still want to see on his father's show.
But it turns out not to be the case, audiences want to evaluate objectively and see the finals of the really talented performers, and now Agutien discredited the show.
"I meet the Goloss participants from Agutina's team, they have been doomed."
"The last time, Agutin showed him his love for Dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The conкурс has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave their dad who doesn't sing but whisper, how can you then call the mentor?"
"It's like singing Daddy, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's Golos show, not "Good Relatives."
"On the side of Agutin it was unprofessional."
"Then you have to offer your dad's show, not the show that's made for the money of Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why the unspeakable pope should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a beautiful voice and temporal slipping, and Pope Agutin led him to the finish?
And then we all complain that the same faces are on stage and on screens for decades!
'Because you don't get through the cucumber.'
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
Around the blast and the cucumber.
And the money in the family budget is not too much!
The absurd theatre continues!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional Gloss, a son of Grades came out on blind auditions.
Then the meter didn't come into the mind to take the son into his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Let's get out of here, all right."
Agutin did not do as a professional.

"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petroukovich.
He also believed that the Moon could be used for the testing of robotics, and that local resources could be used for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in a primitive organic search on Earth satellite, the scholar believes.
This could help to determine how life appears on planets.
Previously, Roscosmos, the head of the Corporation, said that the optimistic version of the RF could take a pilot flight to the Moon by 2030.
The offended client dropped the basket with the facals at the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, 41-year-old St. Petersburg (Florida), called "imel tooth" at the 7-Eleven network shop manager: in May, he expelled him from the shop for misconduct.
And he decided to vengeance his enemy in an original way.
In the afternoon of the second night, he entered the store and fell on the floor and on the part of the goods that had been delivered to the basket.
In the basket there were fecalia and urine that Simms "reciprocated" from the nearby mobile biotualite.
The police who came to the scene arrested the "vent".
He was imprisoned and released before bail at $300.
He was charged with illegal incursions into alien property and criminal offences, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms seems rather funny than serious, the sentence may be severe enough because it has violated the law on several occasions, followed by large-scale robbery, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in intrusion and abuse of animals.

We will face a severe potential opponent.
Just look at Severodwinsk, quotes The National Interest Counter-Admiral Dave Johnson.
However, the publication states that the United States retains the advantage of Russia in this industry.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines Kazan, Novosibirsk, Rasnoarsk and Arhanhelsk are built on an improved Jane-M project (885M).
They have 1,3800 tons of water, 520 m in depth, 64 people in crew, 100 days in autonomy, and 31 hubs in underwater.
The armaments of submarine are mines, 533 mm torpedoes, winged Onics and Calibre missiles.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very hurt.
I couldn't do anything, and it was very hurt.
Sergei Sirotkin, Russian Williams pilot, commented on the result of the Gran Pré Russia race.
"In fact, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and on the second turn, I found myself between the two cars I was immediately stuck.
I lost all the positions that played on the startup, a moment, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others hit the pet-stop, we'd get into the clean air, and we'd go back to the pace, but the rubber was gone.
Plus was fighting a partner, and he was contacted, too.
I understand he was a little mistaken.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most ungrained season track, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it any more," quotes Sirotkin RIA.

Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Such things are incredible foolishness.
I totally disagree what Carrera is doing.
It's just deepening the frustration of the team.
First of all, these are verses, reading and taking them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to it at Carrera's place.
Everybody has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to shake.
If Glushakov and Dzhenko are putting bastards, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian doesn't have the flexibility of the situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
Today Spartacus has no game, so this situation didn't need to be blown off at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus has much to do with different lines, and there is indiscriminateness after the introduction of youth.
The relationship within the team seems not to add optimism to this match," I'm sure Tarpschev.
The two teams will be played on 30 September and begin at 19:00 on Moscow Time.
Earlier, Spartacou, John Terry was the leader of the Youth Team of Chelsea.
Siriusa fountains discussed environmental technologies with scientists
Speakers of the Syrios Education Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre of the Kurchatov Institute.
The presentation of researchers was carried out within the framework of the Global International Forum on Convergent and Natural Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, reported on the educational centre on 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled “Curchatov Koda”, during which the President of the Curchatov Institute, a member of the Correspondent RAN Michail Kowalchuk described global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the Syrius website.
The students learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
This problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will be solved by the environmental technologies that young scientists are currently working on.
In addition, Kowalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of environmental technologies and also described the risks that inevitably arise in the development of such technologies.
"The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge benefit.
This is an explosive increase in medical technology, and it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of environmental technologies is in fact a technological reproducing of living systems.
There's a negotiable side -- targeted intervention in human activity.
The risk is always there.
A car came into existence -- people died under wheels.
But cars still use it.
The dual nature of technology is immediately.
I'm creating a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing the modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the meeting.
Speakers were nominated for physico-thematic sciences, the head of the NBICS-natural-natural technology Kurchatov Institute, Julia Diakova, and the head of the NBICS-technology of Vyacheslav Demin Kurkchaste.
The Syrius Educational Center in Sochi has been established by the Education Fund "Talant and Success" on the Olympic Infrastructure on the initiative of President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The purpose of the educational centre is to identify early, develop and provide further professional support for gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that all-Russian Cyberwiza's online company would be sent to Cyrius.

Macedonia: the referendum was not due to low phenomena
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to “North Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historical province.
The name of the former Yugoslav Republic opens the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as the EFE has said, only 34% of the appearance on a Sunday plebiscite "haven't reached the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to abandon the renaissance.

Kemerovs resented the flock of rams on the cemetery
On 30 September, an eyewitness reported on a known Kemerov social page that the horned animals were freely played on one of the local cemeteries.
The animals of a large flock passed between the sieges and pinched the grass.
The commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm to the cemetery of small horned cattle, and their appetite could even help clear the land from the weeds and plants, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not have to do the following:
"It's a grave, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the rams to do.
You will not say that the rams are leaning, but it is not for them.”
In any event, one eyewitness observed that the animal problem in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
How's it going to be?
Words to push do not exist.
That's right.
The word "squeezing" in the meaning of "tightening, influencing, influence" exists only fantasticly, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "longen."
We use that word to believe it's coming from the word "distorting."
But the pressure and the "satisfaction" are not only intimate but even in some way opposite.
Make sure you do that yourself.
That means "full, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Enjoying, enjoying is family words.
He used to have the meaning of "don't depend on anything, to be self-satisfying."
The Old Slavic "dolly" is related to the words "peace" and "holy".
Giving, suppressing, quite different.
These words are truly intimidating “kindlers”: daos - “wolk” (woman squeezing), deyja - “dea die” and dvaidí - “retaliate”.
The same illustrative form of the words “development” and “sufficiency”, as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, have forced them to become confined.
So we've got this very "d[a]travel" that's also used in the letter through "a", which is kind of incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
So the right thing to do is get to it.
But it is an obsolete word that is no longer used in its proper meaning.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the pressure design, but remember that it's the office.

It's unlikely to have had a significant impact on the outcome."
"Sochi's very hard to rock, is the key to the race to start?"
"Please, yeah, but you never know how it's going to work.
It's not gonna be easy in any case, because our car is slower than Mercedes' cars.

Russia has protected itself from terrorists by means of an operation in Syria
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of whom 85,000 have been destroyed by the RF Air and Space Force.
In connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former head of the VAC, Head of the Committee of the Federation Defence and Security Council, Victor Bondarev, described this.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-propelled vehicles: Air-space forces have inflicted and continue to strike all the terrorist targets accurately.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years, for example, ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
The Russian air strikes have been hacked by the Djihadist Defense -- it has become a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, transmits Interfax.
But, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia to protect itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including “Islamic State” (IG, prohibited in Russia) and “Jebhat al-Nusra” (forbidden in Russia).
According to Genstaba of the Armed Forces of the RF, some 4,000 Russian citizens and about 5,000 post-Soviet citizens were fighting on the IG side.
It is only the registered persons, without counting those who were not identified, who emphasized Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take their weapons into their hands at any time, and Russian passports allowed them to enter our territory freely.
Thus, noted Bondarev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on far-reached borders - otherwise, this evil would be "hung on us".

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UPC with the actions of fascists
Mitropolitan Ilarion, Head of the Foreign Church Division of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the name of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against the Jews.
"It's like that in Fascist Germany, a Jew wearing a yellow octoponic star, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was set up for that purpose," said the Mitropolitan Telescope "Rossia-24" (the Interfax quote).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was at an extreme stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to receive full control of the CCP and “to put it out of law”, the clergyman believes.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church think they're Ukrainian, they're patriots of their country," he added.
Previously, it was known that the members of the Supreme Council were working to implement Bills No. 4128 (reforming the subjection of religious communities), No. 4511 (special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (to change the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the OPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Deputy of the Pochaev Laura called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian sanctuaries
Mitropolitan Vladimir, Vice-President of the Holy-Spain Pochaev Laurna, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and the Ukrainian sanctuaries.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the home site.
In various times of history, our predecessors and our relatives in faith and spirit had to profess their faith and protect their sanctuaries.
In view of the situation that has arisen and the information that we have, and the threats of killing that are spreading, we can see that we will have to survive,” said the Mitropolitan.
He asked for support — prayerful, moral.
The placeholder also stressed that "you're probably going to need your physical presence."
The clergyman added: "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, are threatened with a chastisement, and then we will protect our sanctuary."
Whoever is indifferent to the fate of the Orthodox Laurage of the Orthodox Republic of Ukraine and the world’s sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, says the address.
The Mitropolitan said not to be wronged by those who mislead the believers.
The UPC has a canonic status as determined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 by the Church's mother.
And now, someone wants to get into contact with the news patriarch and the friend of the Catholic pope of the Roman Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us.
And we are pleased with the status that our church has," said the placeholder of the laurel.
He recalled that the UPC had been a canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
What else do we need Tomos?" said the Mitropolitan Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other Tomos denominations have, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers have taken a measure of understanding and determined which temple they are going to.
But someone wants to sift hostility and strife again.
Some are envious of the domes in the temples that they want to destroy," the priest emphasized.
The Plague is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
A laurel is located on the top of the Mount Phaiev, 70 miles [70 km] from Ternopolus.
Its early historical record is at the beginning of the 12th century.

I liked the first period very much.
We didn't use some good moments.
During the second period, the rival slightly quelled us, and we endured.
But the removal of us is a little "food."
Guys played great, did a coach plant.
I think if we keep playing right too, the winners will come.
They didn't kill them, they didn't win with zero heads, but the content of the game was right.
Good luck comes if we keep playing in that direction."
"In your view, "Automobilist" added compared to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then it didn't play a foreign line.
At the pre-session, the teams were doing other tasks, playing a lot of young boys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hokkey.
Automobile is a good team.
The tournament table understands, the team plays right.
Good hokkey, good atmosphere, both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Many good players, there are leaders.
It's a good defense, a good gatemaker.
It was hard, we were cooking.
They knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."
