Good day, excuse me if you didn't have the Internet and could not send it faster.
Say, please, the exact address to go to cleaning tomorrow, what is the key code, and at which hour tomorrow the guests are leaving, and the new guests are settled?
I'm sorry, I have to give up your offer, because I've really found a job in this time.
I'm sorry, but I can't refuse it.
I sometimes feel that through my translator, my thoughts in the Czech language are different from what I wrote in Ukrainian.
We promised you that when you go to school, we'll give you a surprise.
Good afternoon, I'm on course.
But please tell me if there is a time before?
Because I'm not living in Prague, and transport problems can arise.
If there's no choice, I still agree.
Thank you in advance.
In Herson people went back to the rally, the Russians didn't have time to disperse.
As the western agency reported, the chersons were able to hold a rally before military rifles and equipment arrived at the site.
“We've been able to hold a rf ring, and now the technician has arrived,” said one of the western participants.
Previously, the townsmen were traditionally gathering for protests in the Freedom Square -- near the ODA building and the lodgings.
This area is now, like the building, controlled by the armed Russian forces that use weapons against the members of the rally and steal people.
On April 3, the armed Russian occupants reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kahovka.
According to Ukrinform, people in Donetchin regularly carry out peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against people, are wounded and imprisoned.
Russian invaders also steal the people of the area.
President Vladimir Green gave Herson a special name called "The City Hero."
On February 24, the President of the Gothen Rof began a full intrusion into Ukraine.
Russian troops shoot and destroy key infrastructures, carry out mass attacks on Ukrainian towns and villages using artillery, jet fire systems and ballistic missiles.
I'm dreaming of my daddy.
He died the next day after my birthday.
In general, dreams are good.
Hana, good day.
That's what you wrote, and the phone started to charge!
Very good news!
Thank you!
We can meet each other for an hour or two and then I'll go home because I don't have anything to do with myself.
The door in the red combination pulls the rocket into the trash on the Kharkiv Front without change.
You can browse the TV with the harness and the remote, the castle, the pillows, the ceilings, the sprouts.
I also found an underemployment to clean up two quarttires that were given to the tourists every day.
The apartments in the center of Prague are located.
Is it comfortable for you to go to a bank with me on Monday or another day?
Good day, it'd be so good if you could today just like you wrote at 17:00.

It would be better if we had to move because we don't finance European prices.
I need to look at the place and try places where it hurts.
He wants to push right now at all my painful points, he knows what.
Not me, it doesn't have any influence anymore.
I didn't want to talk about him and his drama last night.

So I just feel uncomfortable in my own body.
This is my classmate, Ukrainian.

Maybe we're going to change Vala's shifts?
Mom's going to live here in the grocery room, just as the pay was for the bandwidth.
The Most Important I Have a Place of Life
Sasha wasn't at school today, I wrote to the teacher.
Hi, I'm sick, so it's better to move our meeting to the next weekend, I'm sorry.
I know how to cook, especially to have a recipe, but I like to have a drink.
Ukrainian people are traditionally ditches, varieties, and others.
I have no favorite meals, and I like to try various foods from different countries.
You like cooking, don't you?
I want to be busy.
The train is accurateer and there are no places.
Sorry, we're a little late.
Lucia, can I go to the kitchen as a helper?
It's very good that Julia will have the opportunity to go to work.
I went to their apartment last night.
It's very beautiful and convenient.
On Tuesday, Pablo will tell me if Nazare's going to be a brewer work and when he's supposed to come to make an appointment.
If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Mariopol is the heart of war, stops fighting - we'll have weak positions
President Vladimir Greensky believes that fighting eastern Ukraine and, in particular, Mariopol, will determine the way in which war is going – and if the CSO is defeated, the Russians can leave negotiations and reoccupy the deoccupied territories.
"Mariul is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They (protectors of the city -ред.) are people who dragged a large number of enemies away.
The stronger our position in Mariopolis, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) OOS, and if they are stronger, the table of conquest will be closer to us, and we will have the advantages in a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a situation that is weak in all of these directions, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all of these steps that can lead to return even to the cities that we've now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in conquest will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...."
The Green also said that following the torture of Ukrainians, it's difficult to go into negotiations, but "we must not lose opportunities for a diplomatic solution if we have them."
"People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace at all times.
But if we don't talk emotionally, the war must end with peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims are, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight - but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing else, no people."
Good afternoon, do you have any more room for Czech adults from 19:00 on Tuesday?
You may wish to meet your family in the Angular Mountain.
And these two are my cousins.

I'll try to clean up quickly, but I don't promise.
I'll write to you when the flat is ready for the guests.
Dominica, and who makes the purchase of expendable materials?
This is a regular procedure, or is it necessary to be ordered as long as it ends?
With a change in the Ukrainian literature aesthesis, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality.
It's an analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, a state study
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows for an analysis of the post-modern context as such where metaphor plays an axiomatic criterion

So, we're going to work, and we're going to work.
On Monday, we'll have a leader and we'll decide how and when we're going to take over.
I'm good because I've started pissing that I don't understand anything that I got there.
I think that's the right decision, better to help these people better than when a lot of people do.
My 16-year-old daughter and I are looking for a temporary shelter in Czechia, where the daughter is planning to study at university.

But if you don't want to talk to me, I miss you.
Why did you believe that you did not need such an experience?
Each situation is given for something.
Most of the time, it is for a person to change, especially spiritually.
I'll give you this money, like the bank will approve of it.

You can view a list by link.

Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work with you because I'm going to go to Canada soon.
Immediately after the dash, there are regular names, at the risk side, slang expressions, in parentheses -- abbreviations used in the hours schedule.
I don't want to bother you, relax.
I watched the weather forecast.
I don't need brands.
It's just good clothes at normal prices and so they're sized.
We were at the railway station store.
Professions that offer, possible without language?
It's important if there's a tradition like this, I need to know if I'm ready.
I thought in a week, but we've got a bad situation.
Tomorrow, maybe there'll be a bad connection on the road.
I thank everyone for the experience, even if he is painful.
I think I have learned from every situation to avoid repeating mistakes in the future.
The directives are made in the form of numbered written supplements that are part of this Rules.
I'm sure there's no problem with that.
In Ukraine, many people also celebrate this week.
This depends on religion.
Is there a Greek Catholic or Catholic man.
At the beginning, you can try it free.
Maybe you'll write us an algori, we'll pay for it.
We have that paper that kids get at the end of the school year, this plate, and the witness is given at the birth and married

location, day and time will be refined according to interests and opportunities
We promised you that when you go to school, we'll give you a surprise.
It was great, I have two months of lease, the district in Olomouk doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal violence against civilians north of Kiev.
The photographs of the slaughtered and shot people confused the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?
It's exactly what I've been waiting for.
I brought the children and older parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls of the colleagues with the children, and only afterwards returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently assisted the MSC, and I have never doubted for a moment that in the case of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I've been and remain absolutely certain that the rotten Communist regime has remained unchangeable since 1918.
Without terror, it simply can't exist; it's built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in Zitomir prison.
A few years ago, a copy of a grandfather’s disastrous case was given to the Gitomiri U.S.A.: the whole case is over a hundred pages, and the sentence for execution is very simple and even more fearful.
The accused was illiterate, and his fault was denied.
The Ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was free people, a poor one-way path, never walked in the fortresses.
The fact that there were several cows in hammers was sufficient to denounce the pahar and the feeder of young children for execution.
The family did not even know the place of burial.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken out of the village and killed all except two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's a penal case called Shariy.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I am not surprised if his relative was a KGBist informer.
An apple from the apple nearby, as we know, falls...
The disappointing three of the peasants were the ethnic Russians.
In analyzing the case of the grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are great (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like the "Salad Barak," which is a good reminder of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, descendants of NCWDs have found ways to punish and kill almost all who have seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of steel repression and publicly wrote the names of murderers — the system initially discredited and then destroyed.
It's like on the computer, they found files with child pornography, they put them in prison, and they died quickly.
KDBs are still killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?
The most disgusting features of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism were imposed over the thousands of years of Ordinary tradition from 16 to 19 centuries.
And then over what came out, a beastly genetic experiment was done by cutting the intelligence out during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the half-French "Checist" film in 1992, that's what happened.
Zo you've seen my photos in the bathroom.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from coughs?
Excuse me. I don't have anyone to ask.
I'd like to ask maybe you know where the kids are, because Galia doesn't know them.
Igor asks if it's convenient for you to go tomorrow.
It's very uncomfortable for us to bother you so much.
You're really helping us, thank you!

When do the girls get back from school, what do they then do?
We've come to the place where we've been settled from the center in the garbage, the conditions are good.
But there's a big but here live men like drinking alcohol and smoking in the room, loud music at least what's "bruised," the smell of cigarettes by drunk men and I and the kids... the frightful sleep of lying down.
Please help with the house, for the money please.
But wherever it's safe, it's not smoked.
The smell of cigarettes in the room is like this, and they're just smoked.
I beg you very much, one of them barely stands on his feet, something screams, something he doesn't like.
I'm just praying if you can help.

But it doesn't have to be -- only if it happens, I'm very grateful to you, too.
I'm sure I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.
I had many questions to God, why in my life there are situations that just caused me to lose faith in everything.
I need to buy bread and other food.
I just decided to go and you made congregations.
It's like this, but we don't know where it is, and we don't know where it is. We've been looking for the supermarket for an hour and back on foot. The two cowboys are inappropriate, and we need a big size.

You can have kids come to Vale and play in the lobby.

According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the appropriate offer was sent to the German Ministry of Economics on Saturday.
The cost of 100 gaubys, including a set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As the Gaubins are also offered in the BTR Boxer version of 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks in battle are relatively close to the object of the opponents, Panzerhaubitze 2,000 can fire more than a mile [30 km] away.
According to Ukrainian government circles with reference to the KMW proposal, the supply of self-driven gaubys will be followed by a circular scheme.
The Bundesver will give Kiev 100 of its gaubines in the shortest terms, and the gaps that have been formed will then be filled by the industry at the second stage.
The first new lobbies may be placed 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is that the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?
Thank you.

4. In 2022, refugees from war in Ukraine may request humanitarian assistance in the new workplace of the Office of Work in the Prague Market.
The branch in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed to provide and process requests for assistance, so there is a translator.
Lydia has already been admitted to school, but we're going to go on Tuesday at the teacher's office today.
I'm sitting down, holding my earphones, listening to music and thinking about you and children.
I really want to be with you.
Make you happy.
I don't know, darling, how you doing?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm treating it so that we're together.
I'd say after the war, there'll be a lot of work.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I can do a lot.
So I'm not afraid I didn't get into any of them.
I don't know what's going to happen to the house.
I need a food license test, can I do that?
Please let me have five guests cooking the apartment tomorrow.
Five places I understand in a TV room?

Can we stop with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place?

Write the address in Czech, let's look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much free space there's, so I can't plan with furniture wants to look at that apartment last week and then understand what furniture I need
I'm sorry I've been answering for so long, working was a day, hard to adapt.
Is that enough yet?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have such an opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me how it suits you.
There's already a bed and a bathroom for a child here.
Don't forget what you promised to help me how you'll have the opportunity, but not the last thing to give
I want to make a stroke called a cap.
I don't want her to come with us, so I don't want her to get infected.
Only I'll be a little bit later, about 8. Can I?
I don't want to be confused with you.
Because I'm worried that everything is okay!
Because we didn't even talk to these excursions!
I understand how important this is for you!
And I'm not talking about myself. It's just a peak that I can't understand.
After the celebration?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Cole and I had a bad start in translating the test yesterday.
I will ask Gregory Danisenka or Jonaschek) to help me with some mathematical concepts.
Can I and they be useful?
If this is possible, I want to raise mathematical terms in the weekend.
The geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with Colea without mistake.
Thank you for your test tasks.
We also look forward to it.
That's how she's happy to have any gift.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number.
Yesterday at 402 bus stops, I met Ukraine, Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine where I felt my heart reciprocated.
The branch in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed to provide and process requests for assistance
turns out I ordered a backup card
Don't, I'm a simple man.
So she doesn't get scared that no one came
The main thing you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the House of the Holocaust, Babin Yar, in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews at Babino Yar.
I had the privilege of following three heads of State, including the president of Germany.
He spoke of "the foundation of international law and human dignity, freedom of people to choose their course and life in territorial integrity, peaceful and safe Europe.
That's the foundation that we have to protect is also part of our responsibility as it relates to our history."
If "the wicked demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never more!
The fight has to go on."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of civilians, starved the cities blocked by it, and let them die of sickness.
The Russian troops carry out mass bombings of Ukrainians, even visually like gunfire in Babina Yara.
Over a month, the Germans see this in real-time news.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctioning, providing humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been imagined for so long.
Germany is delaying the heavy arms shipment required by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against mass murders, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine without the risks and victims.
One song to you at night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be assembled
All were sick only Lydia didn't have a new kind of microne in them.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using this plate instead of the plagues.
Pick up your documents late.
The ticket cost me a guide of 2,000 guineas
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a far-reaching prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO entry, and only 18% of those interviewed were "for."
After the Revolution of Honority, Victor Janukovic, Krymian anexia, and the beginning of the War of Donbassi, the number of NATO opposers began to fall, and the adherents, on the contrary, to increase.
Since the commencement of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of Ukrainian accession support to NATO among Ukrainian citizens — over 75 percent.
Despite the support of the Ukrainian entry into NATO and the assistance NATO provides in the context of the war, there are now many criticisms on the account of the Alliance and the country members -- for the late supply of weapons, the refusal to cover the sky, the reluctance to irritate Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the position of the RF if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will be given reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In a new episode of the "Blood Questions", together with the editor of "European Truth", we talk about how Ukraine's Alliance had helped since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees that are being discussed on Russian controversy could become the second Budapest Memorandum.
As you think it's here.
My partner in the volt is marked by what my Statement is at the hearing.
I gave it to her because of this mobile app
We need to go to the convention center and find out how to do this because it was formed in Poland, where visas were not given but were given.

Ukrainian reports that the Czech Republic sent tanks to Ukraine T-72 and combat machines to infantry
I'm going to leave the kids myself waiting there for three or four years and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take it 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a heartfelt feeling toward this man, but he did not act very well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and apologized to me.
I denied him.
After a while, he called that he had a heart surgery.
He asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I had psychological support for him for nearly half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
I had problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
Thus, God himself chose our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks in Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place, and that's what I'm glad I've got to be with a baby right now.
You had to remember me before?

I understand for myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, do you think it's gonna give me a paper?
They probably forgot the guests, I put them in the cabinet.
You may have to go to bed to work tomorrow.

It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something second, and I don't sleep, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming that they're bombing...
God will never be late, for all things his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me.
I understand very well the price of unskilled work, and I realize that the job I had at home in Kiev I can't have the money I've earned at home right now I'm not going to get.
But just sitting down and not doing anything, I can't, because then all the bad thoughts in my head lie down, so you have to do something physical.
At the airport, documents are issued from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at another time you can just wait.
Vladimir came back at 4 p.m.
So we took them to our home.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.

She's home with my uncle's handing over rollers and rolling boards, and she's riding at her house, so it's got
I got up at 9:00, and I'm just getting breakfast now.

We want to report a change in the house and file the documents for the continuation of the map.

One mother said she was sleeping for children with dancing dough
He's coming to see you.
Please say, and do you have an approximate cleaning schedule for the month ahead, though for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule.
The Russian army threatens to strike rocket attacks on Kiev: they say, "Don't do that before."
And the direct language of Konaschenko, we're looking at the attempts at diversia and the task of striking Ukrainian troops on objects in the area of the RF.
If such incidents continue, the RF forces will strike in the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously held.
The Russians have caused rocket strikes on Kiev since the early days of the total invasion of the RFs into Ukraine.
On February 25, Russian missiles that defeated the Ukrainian APS system fell on a large apartment house on the capital Pozniks.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-story site at Valerie Lobanowski.
On March 1, the Russians hit the television show on the roads near Babino Yara, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian U.S. systems beat Russian missiles over the South railway station flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defence.
On March 14, the debris of the bombed rocket of the occupants smashed the house and the Trolleybus on Kurenevka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a housing area on the Vineyard, resulting in the death of one person, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed modern Retroville TRC, killing at least 4 people.
On April 13, the Mayor of Kiev Vitalius Clycco announced that the inhabitants of the capital who had evacuated from the city had yet to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still cause rocket strikes on Kiev and that there were many mines and unexploded munitions in the capital.
On April 12, the Ukrainian Department of Defense Investigations warned that the Russians planned to predominate a number of terrorist attacks in the RF to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1, oil erupted near Belgorod in Russia as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that the Ukrainian shell fell near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are thrown into the cold sweat from the very thought that the natofic fighters would be beaten by Russian bombers in heaven in Ukraine.
But Greens is not talking to them as much as with their voters and societies as a whole.
The Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Green doesn't persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convince the European nations that are chosen by those politicians.
And these talks, this sophisticated alloy of strength, touchingness, and times of despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Baiden is categorically opposed to the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Even though Paris or Brussels are opposed to Ukraine’s early entry, the process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered fraudulent.

These are heroic leaders who, without fear, go to the battle zone, calm down and help the refugees in the cars, and at peace stations help volunteers to load the humanitarian cars.
These are the vehicles that were on the Zhitomiri track in the early days of the war and patiently served the frightened and upset people.
They are merchants who carry the garbage under fire, repair the water supply and the electrical transmission lines to ensure that the people are needed.
They are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day without complaining for nothing, and they are still volunteering in a free minute to gather pharmacies on the front.

The head of President Andrey Jermak told us that Russia was starting a "fellow operation" about the weapons that allies are sending to us.
Yermak's direct language is, "They understand that they're losing war, they're seeing their backlog and they're trying to "should" the supply of arms by any method.
For example, one of the last fairies is the brute destruction of Slovakia's C-300 SADS.

The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provocation. ”
“Reports of the murdered, raped and seriously injured by the Russian forces of the Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation,” stated New Zealand Prime Minister Jasinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“The Russians must answer before the world for what they did,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister, Fumio Kisida, described incidents as “the violation of international law”.
The statements were made after the arrival of reports that hundreds of peaceful residents were fired and thrown into the fraternal graves or left in the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Buchy by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for a few weeks.
Photographs that allegedly depicted the bodies of civilians who had been executed with tied hands shocked many and called for more sanctions against Russia and the criminal persecution of the guilty.
President of France Emmanuel McRon stated in radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops committed “war crimes” in Buchy.
“What happened in Boochi requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed to Russian coal and oil exports.
Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, stated that Russian troops could go so far as they did a “genocide” in Buchy.
“We will make sure that those who committed these war crimes do not remain incarcerated, ” said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late April 3, the spokesman Maria Zacharov of Russia rejected the accusation as “provocation. ”
She stated without evidence that the United States and NATO had “subjected” images to discredit Russia.
“ In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the early minutes after these materials appeared does not cause any doubt about the one who had said this story, ” said Zechariah.
Previously, Russia’s Minoбороны also declared without evidence that the image of Buchy was “one more of the orders of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the United Nations Security Council to meet on April 4, to discuss what it called “the provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Buchy.
On April 4, Russia’s follow-up committee issued a statement declaring “Investigation” for charges of spreading “recognized false information” by Ukraine about the Russian forces in Buchy.
On April 3, Vladimir Greensky, President of Ukraine, accused Russian troops of the “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Buchy to see what their military forces did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” said Greensky in the video turn, going from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the military in Ukraine.
"When we find people bound behind their backs with their hands and hands unheaded, I don't understand," he said about the victims' scenes scattered on the streets of Buchy, about 35 kilometres northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, correspondent in the Ukrainian Service, the Council of Freedom saw the body on the streets of a small city of like civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw at least 21 people in various places of Buchy.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all in the civilian — were scattered on the ground near a place that local residents described as using Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a close distance.
In general, Ukrainian authorities stated that at least 410 peaceful residents were found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told, "Kyeva is not." As the occupants were carrying the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion is accompanied by frightening things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another point in this list, which is now much less information about — the removal of the local population into the territory of the enemy.
About mid-March, Russian occupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporaryly occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military poligon.
"Ukrainian truth" found the imported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been voluntarily evacuated outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and indifference.
Fortunately, they live and maintain contact with their family.
However, in view of Ukrainian claims, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity house, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine from the voyage of Joseph Zeppinski.
Alexander's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valy moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the Anton Airport, which is about 20 miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town even though she was a civilian.
Like true plastics, Denis and Marina had in advance collected alarming suitcases, but the morning of February 24 didn't evacuate.
They had no automobile, and the suburb buses no longer took anyone.
About 12 o'clock in February 24 they saw helicopters with the Latin V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17 until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, some 40 persons were hiding in their basement.
Not all of them decided.
"Soon 6th evening, February 24th, people who didn't speak Russian or Ukrainian came into the drive.
They say, "Is there anyone?" "I say it is." "Come out!"
They searched me, asked who was in the basement if there was a weapon.
All men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you by orders of Ramsan Kadirov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even a military force, young boys 25 to 35 years old.
They said, "One of us in the war helped Ukrainian, Sasko Billy, who commanded the nationalist team of the Wicking, who fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-chen war, UP, and now we're helping you."
On the third day, they asked what we were missing.
We say that the waters were a big problem with her.
They broke the store, they took the goods under the pretext of "Russian anyway" and they brought us six bottles.
There's a video on the Internet where kids thank Kadirov for food.
So that's what they're doing after the robbery of the store, they brought the sausage and they say, "We understand that's wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsan Ahmatovic."
No one especially wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, "You have seven days to give up our phones," they laughed.
Still, they kept separating themselves from the Russians.
They said, how good it is that they came, because they didn't want wars, Ukrainians are backed up, and they're pretty good, "Putin is a bastard, Kadirov, too, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly, they didn't fight, they rode shops, they looted.
One was tied to one leg of the Georgi ribbon and one of them was a white sabotage and called it a militia.
They were not trained at all in Ukraine.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten on Boochi, so that they didn't even take the murdered, they said to us, "You have a artillery?"
More than that, we had the loose bands — the chequens among themselves did not know, in the first days they asked passwords to discover whether they were strangers.
We had them until March 13, after which the Russian OMON came and followed them by the Omistadian.
They put 30 to 40 units of equipment between houses -- ours were constantly hit by the Bairaktars.
But these came and told us that there's no SSO, but there's Azov, and they say, "Azza" is thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The Kiev's already surrendered was on the move since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian officer, or a desent officer, or a representative of the FSB, came to see us and said that there would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was about Booch, Gostomel, thought maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the beginning, we gave the Chechens our lists, they promised to contact Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Spoil your children's mentality!"
As it worked, they stole us into the basement and started shooting from underdoor -- or "Gradams," or minomet.
And then it came back... the neighborhoods just burned down, some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer the borders and the Red Cross.
The part didn't leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland, saying, "you're gonna be shot and sold to the organs."
We were transported through Chernobyl, along both sides of the road, with burning, broken technology, even though the Belarusians told us that the Russians were transporting technology right to them.
A lot of caponists, fossils, and soldiers.
At the "Comar" white point, we passed improvised control, many of them were not documented at all because they burned.
We were placed in the tabernacles of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear the shots, the rocket shoots, and we can see that this is the "Iskander" work on Kiev.
Although these of the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, these are planes flying, they turn around on the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we know what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the Chunky sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Hunger Vasil Stepanović, came and said, "Here I am a hochol, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenk will not stop until these thieves kill you.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say so."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us, "You're traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least they were called) spread misinformation that men in Poland could not go.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a document problem — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and Thursday began the war.
In the Ukrainian Consulate, we were not helped, but in Minsk, in the station, said that no one would be taken to the bus without passports.
Here I'll tell you that the Belarusian volunteers really helped us.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
Our second group, the migratory representative said that you can live here at least a week and a half because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payment here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Walking near Mozir (about 50 miles [50 km] from the UP border), we saw ballistic missile launches on Ukraine: the rocket first flys, brilliantly shines, and then hangs.
People sitting on a bus in Mozir told me that the Russians there were constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us she would break something to her son if he was called.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not understand that their polygons are used to shoot Ukraine.
Friends who took us to Estonia were waiting for us in Poland.
Now we go through the registration, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, Ukrainian flags are probably as many as Estonian."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18th and 22nd.
In the morning of February 24th, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
Tonight they went to sleep in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina herself couldn't go home, and in principle she wouldn't be able to go home.
No one knew anything about evacuation.
Can't you get to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. We're waiting for you all the time.

On April 1, the city head of Buchy Anatolium Fedorook announced the joyful message that the Ukrainian military released the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupants were thrown out of the whole region of Kiev.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at this time was eclipsed by horror and hatred, for at the same time it was known that at least 280 civilians were shot in Buchy alone.
They were killed on the streets, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, some killed, teenagers.
The statues of the village of Motín Olga Suhenko, her husband, Igor, and the son of Alexander, were killed and followed.
The bodies of Olga and Alexandra were in a brotherly tomb, Igoria in a sewerage.
Both sides of the 20 kilometres of Kyiv discovered the bodies of several scattered women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.

President Vladimir Greensky stated that certain types of armaments that western partners provide were too late.
He said this in an interview by the Associated Press, whose passages were published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth."
"Every equipment they've already sent, for some kind of equipment it's done too late.
So what if we, for example, talk about Mariopol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the value of these changes," said Green.
On the question of, it's got enough weapons to get Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The President also said that if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have been, or it would have looked different.
"She would've turned around differently, we'd have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be wars," he added.

But perhaps you need more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm trying to make you happy with my job.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but I'm studying in Czechia, on the speciality of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with your kids and your grandmother.
I want you to be with me.
It's hard to do in a foreign land, and every day it's going to get home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as much as possible.
I remember you for life.
And I'll mention and smile
So thank you so much for Ania's still paved a route in the telescope so we can get to it faster.

"We've been hiding a month from a motherfucking infu about war.
So far, it's going to work.
However, in the Blaze (wheel - UP) on the powder and back paws, the fur may be strained, altered food, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are removed, but the stress on me doesn't depend, unfortunately.
The blade, unlike the candle, is not deaf, hears both raw and bangs."
Thanks to Olga's hearing badly and spending most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov took the gun for the first time in her life.
"33 days I lived with her in the apartment.
War was also hidden from her, and the fact that I was next to her was as formally coming for hours as always.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver -- she listened for four hours, then I sang two hours."
The radio was always at the bed.
Most of the time she spends in her room.
It's bad to hear -- it's allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her "gods," I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid a receiver and a TV.
And then I called everyone who's talking to her, and it's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything, but not about war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17 -- I've got two apartment cleanings:
Good evening, I didn't think of it somehow.

I understand you and I don't complain, but in my situation, I'll be looking here for you.
I'm telling you the embassies are here.
A British who defended Mariopolis in the VSL lava says he's ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier from the Ukrainian Mariopolis Mariopolis Mariopol Armed Forces Brigade said to his friends and family that they would lay their weapons and surrender to the Russian occupants.
Source: The twitter page of Aidine Acelin, the British who has served in the U.S.A. лавs since 2018, the BC with reference to Aislin's family and friends, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of the second Eislin who had talked to him.
It's literally twitter Acelin's saying, "We've received a message from him, 48 days have passed, we've tried everything we can to protect Mariopol, but we don't have a choice, except for surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, hopefully the war will end soon."
Parts: Aslene served in the 36th separate SSO Football Brigade, which is involved in Mariupoli's protective operation.
The VBC journalists contacted the mother of the military officer, En Wood, and she confirmed that her son on the phone said they were going to fall captive.
Another military friend, Brenan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last telephone conversation, Icelin spoke about plans for their capitulation unit.
He said that the brigade had ended with ammunition and food.
The Atlas News journalists contacted his friend, who said that Euslin's unit was about to surrender to Russian subdivisions so that it would not be without weapons and bullets to the hands of the so-called "caderiers."
Societies also promoted a telephone recording that allegedly called Eislin to talk to his acquaintance American friend who planned to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Asleen said that they tried to get out of town in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British used to tell him that Instagram threatened him by the private military company Vagner.
Eislin was a social worker in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight against the so-called "Islam State" terrorists in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the ranks of the U.S.A. and made a vow.
Acelina's friends and loved ones called Johnny, and in social networks he's more famous under Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.
But it's not gonna be easy, you're gonna have to find it...

I want me to be able to thank all who helped us, because that was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of work because I lived in the village too, so I can work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we're going to Christmas like this.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved legal project 7,176, which is entitled "To monitor potential threats to Ukrainian national security in the economy."
It's strange that essentially the only potential threat to Ukrainian national security in the economy has been found... the place where the supervisory board holds.
Legislators believe that decision - making by the supervisory council in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve Ukrainian national security problems.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers to the holders, but until no company has ever known that it is necessary to physically sit down at the location of the board.
The potential threat from this law was understood to be an excellent basis for "removing" all the gains in the heavy reform of the aftermath of the Revolution of Honor, including independent supervision of the council, and then to establish manual management.
The one that was before 2015.
Why should the Council’s supervisor be held firm, and who should enter them?
More than that, if under patriotic slogans fly one detrimental law-project, others may fly tomorrow — for example, the public procurement system can be removed through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot of things can be written off for war.
And by the way, this initiative came into being before the war and the law-project 7176.
On February 22, this standard was added to a comparative table of 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the oversight of the council in one way or another circulates among some national choices a long time ago.
Not for the sake of criticism, but to show the possible consequences of the law, let us consider the arguments that explained the need to accept it.
And then let's give us our suggestions on how to solve the issue of controlling security entrepreneurship during the war.
The first deputy minister of the economy, Denis Kudin, explained the need for such innovation with the risk of losing the Internet and other means of communication that would make it impossible for the remote work of the supervisory councils.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions because the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that such a risk is present, but will it not be able to prevent the movement of supervisory council members to Ukraine?
Imagine a pretty cynical situation where independent members of the supervisory council (most of the members of the entire body) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they may be freed by law.
And then, it's probably going to lead to the loss of the quorum that is needed by the supervisory council to make any decisions.
Instead, it would be impossible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board because the law envisages the need for a competitive selection, which is an average of three to four months.
Thus, the decision proposed by law - affiliated 7,776 will most likely not be able to avoid losing the supervisory council’s ability to make decisions, but rather to do so!
People's deputy, the author of Dmitro Nataluch's law-making, gives other arguments in his support.
In particular, he says, "a lot of businesses, such as the UPC, now need relocation," and that's why it's hard to imagine that human beings can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom, discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
In Ukraine, for the first time, there are almost no OPC businesses that are supervised by the Council.
The board is not in the Ucrosmonproma, which essentially runs almost all OPC businesses.
But even in the Ucrossproma, according to legislation, the board of oversight has some limited powers, and all its members are not free of charge.
The fullness of power in the Ucroporonroma belongs to the Director-General, who will, by the way, decide whether to relocate a OPC company that is part of the consort.
Moreover, this argument is not tolerated by criticism because of the fact that OPC’s regulators have not changed the legislation of 7176 at all.
Mr. Dmitro, on his Facebook page, also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with improving the efficiency of holders and holders, but let's try to dismantle some of them, "minored foreign experts in the first word of war," left Ukraine in 2021, but staying members of the supervisory councils in Ukrainian state enterprises with full salary in several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself actually suffers from war."
First of all, it's manipulation — most of these supervisory council members have never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally come here.
So to say they're leaving Ukraine, gently saying, unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisors have long used online meetings.
This tool is long - known in the world’s practice, with its entirely different areas of business, education, medicine, and so forth.
And you shouldn't forget, too, that membership in the supervisory council is not full-time work.
Usually, these people have other jobs, and just the electronic communication tools help them do that.
Thirdly, all of these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to members of the Ukrainian Governing Council?
Because they're not at the place where they're located their companies.
It's not, by the way, the first populistic attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.

We usually need the passport of one adult.
In Brovarski, the Visgarsk, and the Buchann district of Kiev, exempted from occupation, an increased curfew will take place for two days.
Pavluka's direct language is, "In the populated areas of Brovarski, Visgar and Buchan districts under the Russian occupation and released by Ukrainian defence forces, the curfew has been increased!
In the area of these cities and villages, the restrictions will take place from April 21:00 to April 6.00:05."
Details: According to the head of the raid, it is categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of the towns and other public places, travel by transportation and foot.
The residents can go outside only when an alarm is signaled to get into shelter.
Such restrictions are imposed to remove the consequences of Russian aggression — to clean up and clear areas.
The Omelianuk called on the people who had left these areas for the time being to refrain from returning home.
The curfew will last every day from 9:00 to 6:00 a.m. in the rest of Kievland.

Lukashenka’s regime has delayed three bilorus for 27 and 28 years, resulting in the destruction of two line boxes of a signal station under Osipovice, which ensures the movement of trains.
Source: "Radio Swaboda", "Vijnasna" law enforcement centre, Chief of the MBC Police, Hennadi Kazakevic, quoted by the Whiteta holder.
The IBC of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three Bobruisk residents were detained with force support from the SBI specialists, one injured.
According to Victim, when the men were delayed, they were actively opposed and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees is injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with local medical assistance.
The IBC criminal police officer of Belarus, Hennadi Kazakević, stated that "the acts of terrorism in the Railway of the RB will be severely suspended" by weapons-using forces.
On April 6, it was known that on March 30, the police detained another Belarusian railway officer, a staff member of the Bahranovice office of the BWD and the U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S. U.S.

By the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for the diversion.

U.S. forbids investments in the RF and impose sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of President R.P. Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and Sberbank, and forbids all new investments to Russia.
This is the report on the White House site.
Sbierbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the U.S. financial system and will ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a complete ban on new investments in the FM.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Bayden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of where they are.
"This step is based on the decision of over 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms,” is the White House statement.
The third step of new United States sanctions was restrictions on major Russian government critical industries.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
The Minfin's detailed list will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the full-year-old children of Putin, the wife and daughters of the Foreign Minister of Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-president and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
Sanctions remove them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it's one of my births:
Mr. Reirard, I'm sorry I haven't seen it.
We're going to the medical station right now.
I mean, we need to work this hour on another day.
What day would it be better for her to come before?
Tomorrow, I'll listen, the Internet's bad.
You're the right thing to do.
Thank you... they found something out of things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners know nothing but alphabet
Nothing's happening.
May I be on Monday, 25.04?
Kids can be taken with you, toys are enough:)
Guessed About Dad
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'm going to think about this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But how this will be paid, please, no loans.
Write me straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner, or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take the clothes we got?
It's not my day today. It's broken in the living room. It's the other night.
I don't see anything coming from you.
I’m also so sad
I'll remind you of the facture later.
You're the only one who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean a house and how many windows do the house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share with you.
Raj to read Joe Dispenso, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
The television journalist Natalia Nagorna published a video on the morning of April 12, which she received from the 36th Maríupol Natalia Mariopolian army team.
They say that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "the account goes for an hour."
Before that, on April 11th, a special brigade of the marine infantry that participates in Mariupoli's defense, published a referral to Ukrainians in Russian.
It was stated that April 11 might be the last fight for Mariupoli defenders, and the Ukrainian military command was not connected to the fighters for two weeks.
Skepsis was expressed in the social media that the application was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerie Zaruzny, assured us that commanding the defence forces in Mariopolis is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal factory in Maríupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupants hurled a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariopol.
According to Andrey Belletzky's leader, the army of the RF has used chemical weapons over the Azovstal factory, which keeps the Azoz kidnappers from fighting.
Thank you, I'm gonna be comfortable with you.
The situation is the same. We're staying here.
( 2 hours of ride ) walks, Mom shopping, and back!)
It doesn't matter.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech drons Esscadrilia has been flying over Ukraine since now.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used to detect, and some of them will be for the direct destruction of the hostile invader.
Two of the Czech brothers and two of them were sent to Ukraine on the other day thanks to the representative of the Mukachev city council, Vladimir Labutenka.
Today, their inter-girl friends, led by the leader of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/Bysil Schurre, delivered the drones to their destination: they were given special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where they are now in battle.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of copters, they're going to be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from Czechia do not plan to stop, say that in the nearest days to Ukraine, many more interesting gifts will serve as the destruction of the Russian occupant and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, everything's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without it.
I'm worried we won't be late.
I'm going back to Ukraine, and I'm still working.
All right, if it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try myself, but if there's a problem, I'll write it to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the old lady in the village in Iowa, she saw me and that I was pregnant but she said there was no housing.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll get up.
I got the phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still freezing in the street today.
Drinking medication and tea, feeling worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, put me down the music you like.
I'm interested in how much music you've got.
Listening to Mom and Dad
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It's been cooler and raining tonight.
But it is not a pity for the broken homes, the pity of people who are being mistreated by occupants
In Herson, the occupants were wrecked with the Lord of Ukraine's Memorial in Herson on the street of Percopska.
The details: it's noted that the unknown broke the flag of the European Union, shattered the panels with photographs of the Celestial Celestial hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants have erased portraits of Heaven's heroes of hundreds and dead members of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag has been dropped.
Good morning, thank the kids for caroling, we don't have this habit, so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed.
There's someone who can talk to you.
Because I'm living a type in the grocery group until the twelve here will be people, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've been in a boat today.
Even today it's been sleeping.
So we have great progress.
I'm sure I'm going to get the cooks in another time!
My day I don't have the power to do it.
Since I have a day - to - day cleaning work after the guests, I can say about April a month because I have an approximate cleaning schedule.
For May, I can say about the end of April or early May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't been writing a dinner for a while and I slept a little bit.
If you don't mind, can I come tonight?)
or I'll meet you after you're here.)
He's a modest man, he's been learning a lot lately, and he's really needed it in his life.
Hi.) It went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people at such a high position.
Today, a lady who is the director of the Economy Department has had a lesson.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grish in a manger was acting well.
On Monday, I have to bring confirmations for workplaces and cash payments for jars.
I'm lazy on Friday.
I do nothing but a lot of them and I sleep.
If tomorrow's the doctor, I left with you, if I can.
I have to get another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It's very bad to work with a vodka, it's washing off, you need a master, you have to fix it.
So there's enough.
Can you send me a correct email address?
I'd like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you've been enrolled in.
And are children feeding there or should they be brought with them?
And now, for a moment, there's one question to go to you.
If There Is Still a Need for Help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to raise money so people don't think we're going to be hot on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough two points:
I'm going to go to rest, get some energy and energy, thank you for the present present.
This is going to be good, because the whole family is going to be drawing.
The Karasin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossips.
Look only for official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stays in Ukraine also helps the army.
I collected some work for the portfolio.
The Internet is supposed to be held after holidays.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
As I'm counted the day I wasn't at work is a pass
Consolidation of headquarters: Russia prepares provocation in Princestruia to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can provocate in the Princestrov region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
It's literally saying, "No exception is made by the armed forces of the Russian Federation to conduct provocative action in the Princestrov region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create a successive group of troops for action in the Slavonic direction.
Probably in the nearest days, occupants will try to rebuild the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send a special warehouse, armaments, and equipment to participate in warfare in Ukraine.
Arms and military equipment are being trained at the 60th separate motor gunfire (Monistry) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably the targeted armaments will be moved to a temporarily occupied area of the Donetsk region.
In addition, a set of military personnel from the designated brigade are also being carried out to restore the loss of the special composition of the battalion tactical unit of the 36th separate Moto Shot Brigade (Borzya, Zabayqala).
The enemy has a special problem in the recruitment of drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of the unit from the permanent distribution point is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
Probably, an opponent to disrupt the supply of cargo to combat sites will continue to strike traffic infrastructures in Ukraine to destroy or dismantle them.
Defined units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian and Belarusian borders in the Brest and Gomel districts.
In the Slavonic direction, separate units from the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the northern fleet continue to block the city of Harkova, and the artillery shells of individual parts of the city continue.
In the Izuma direction, an air search of the area is being carried out to identify the positions of the armed forces of Ukraine.
That's what the opponent uses, Orlan-10.
With the strength of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack in the directions of the Long and Dmitrewk settlements, and he did not succeed, and he left behind.
In the Dutch direction, the opponent continues to focus on the subordination of the Pozna, Rubizne, Lower and Novobachutica, as well as on the establishment of full control over the city of Mariopol.
The enemy tried to attack the Golden region, and he did not succeed.
In the city of Maraupol, by means of artillery and air operations, occupants continue to attack the Azovstal factory and the seaport.
With the forces of individual units, the enemy fired artillery attacks on the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the Town, the Worky Lover, and the Marian.
In the Donetsky and Luhanas districts, Ukraine's defenders in the past four enemy attacks have been attacked, five tanks have been destroyed, eight armored, six automobile units, and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
We're sure we're gonna try to make it a good time, but I'm doubting.
How can you sleep and I'll hold you back?
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me I'll get it.
We didn't watch TV at home, and the more 1 plus 1 don't have to set up:
I'm going to turn on the TV solely to listen to the Czech language.
I've got a month's tariff package finishing today.
Can we do this today on the phone?
Buying a tissue for elevation, canvas, threads for elevation
I understand that I can prepare the material in this field.
I ask her, I feel a little embarrassed to ask, and she gives us so many pies.
I'll meet my father, and I'll see him again.
I've read the Facebook announcement, but maybe Google wrote something on its own, I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we've brought the things you've brought, but there are things that are small in us in 10 min can you get them?
I thought about my job.
If Mr. Director arranges, I can start my job from the next week because tomorrow before lunch, I plan to go to the office to present documents (if I get out, because it's very big queues) and on Saturday rain:
I'm looking for a brigade at the beginning, I liked chemistry at the school, studying Czech, to know perfectly, the dream of working on Tevi.
Friends of old and not very much, friends who I don't know personally, friends by spirit and mind.
Now you've had a hard time too.
During the last month, I have been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy since then, has turned from his feet to his head, as is the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have confessed that they feel guilty and embarrassed because of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why Ukraine is given your name.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
Early in March, I wrote Alexandra Chercasov, my very old friend of the Memorial.
I'll tell you a little bit later, - as usual, Sasha answered in a brief way. - Now, after the search, we're going down the ruins.
Others are cultures, artists, critics, writers — struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for the very few of you -- those who worked in the Moorial, New newspaper, the Mosque Echo, the Medus, the Naval organization, and in other places -- have many of you ever done anything to resist this regime?
Except for participating in the rally when they were still.
Also read the column of Russian journalist "Last Hide, Too Late to Silence."
And if so, you're sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is going on around you, your apathy, and your passive fellowship, which is now likely a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period of time when you had a degree of freedom and democracy -- a ruthless even bloody but real one.
But 1991 wasn't a better year than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you're finally so fearful of turmoil that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let his name Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still feel safer around him.
Indeed, there have been mistakes.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans from the strains did, you took the soul to the monument of Zerginsky -- and allowed the KGB to lie down on the bottom, update, reform and take power over the country.
When you were confronted with a choice between the country's robbery and the return of Communists, you did not fight for a third option — and you humiliatedly agreed with the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallyings for great social justice or war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
Then came Putin, the young, the entrepreneur, the aggressive, he promised to break up with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it, or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya again with the earth, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was then working in Chechnya to help the victims of theпутin anti-terrorist operation, and with my eyes I saw the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of peaceful people, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of their families.
You said to me, "Oh, we're already tired of your Chechnya." I remember these words very well.
And I resented, "Friends, this isn't my Honor, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid alien here.
It's your authority that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was too difficult, it was too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturn of the middle of the zero, caused by rising oil prices and by Putin's willingness to look through the finger on the fact that part of the stolen money would remain in the middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - earned, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and have found a better job.
Prices grew, but is it a disaster?
Moscow shone celebratingly and shining from its neck.
When a few opponents were killed — Yuriya Chekochina, Ann Polyticovsky, Alexander Lithuanianca, and others — many of you were shocked and horrified about what had happened.
Still, the matter was not going on.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over President Medvedev's post, and he took the premiere's place, I see you barely noticed it.
When after a few months of the reign of Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or silenced it.
How many of you I've met in the next years on the Hudouri mountain slopes, in the Kazbechi hills or in the cafe and in the Turkish Tbilisi baths, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we've hardly done a lot in the West, if we've done anything at all.
A little indignation, a little sanction; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when such a great temptation for Russian oil, gas, and the inner market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, are still awake.
When Putin changed his seats again with Medvedev and planted a presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much and you went out massly to protest.
Naval's name became obsessive, you didn't leave the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrified to lose the ground underneath.
After that, he struck in reply.
At first, alternative stocks were organized, and more repressive laws were enacted, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were in prison.
Some have received huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often, I can still hear it.
"The government is so strong and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Agitated by the prorosian president, who cheated on their European expectations, they once captured Midan — and never abandoned him.
They built their own tent town and prepared themselves for a firm defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they became protected with wands, armaturs, and molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police fired.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters were attacked.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitive was Janukovich, and the Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose and expel leaders themselves, if they do their business badly.
Madan was very displeased with Putin.
This was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he captured Krym.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits were few.
And how many of you were fascinated!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the anexia.
Then suddenly a new myth came, and many of you who despised Putin and his chick came back to 180 degrees and began to love him.
I find it difficult to find a reason because immediately afterward we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were generally silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, like new ones after the resurgence that Moscow's mayor began in 2012 with their binges, the publicly available cyphoid and the Hipper cafe.
Actually, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, wasn't it?
IDIL or something, even a Moscow editor who released my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview, because I had no idea what happened in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw the state snipers shooting coldly in my kids' ages on the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers, who started bombing thousands of civilians in 2015, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Nimeller:
"First they came to the socialists, but I said, 'because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the trade union members, but I spoke because I wasn't a member of the trade union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I spoke because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but no one else could say something to my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians, or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some actually say right now — like Dmitro Glukhovski, Michael Schishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osip, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the inside of the country like Marina Ostownnikova, risking getting into a new GULAG or forming a company of Navalno.
As for others, you know best where you live.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin is dealing with the Ukrainians, or that it seems very likely if he doesn't, he'll be for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who are courageous, but mostly in private, protests have still taken place in a small time, but they will soon get more serious.
Thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social media (hey's even a black square in Instagram) or who spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
At times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were simply anecdoteed, they were not in such a distant past — and now they, with great probability, are waiting for you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians — even more than 2014 — is frightening the Putinian regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that mind, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how oppressive he is on paper.
In view of everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know well what's going on right now.
You're reading offline news on the Internet, you've got friends or even relatives in Ukraine that you're in contact with.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's going to do.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your election is just hohma, your laws, if you don't mind repressive, worth nothing more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media are gone, your economy is ruined faster than I write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket for a plane abroad, even if some flights are left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can either try or go, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see another option.
Still, there is another one.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe in the circumstances you're going to need less than you think.
Consider this.
The spark will not come from you, because of the economic collapsion that comes to Russia, it's probably going to be in the province, in small cities.
When prices go down and the wages don't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the street.
Putin knows that and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if every city goes to the towns on its own, as it has been periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
An organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will have to be converted into mass.
You have this great magical tool -- the internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up in almost any circumstances.
The Naval organization has been shattered, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot of people, you're millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it's over 300 thousand, it's going to be staggered.
We'll have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all that he had forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he had forced them through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will have a sense of fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, it's normal.
I'd be scared, too.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to disregard their host who dare not only to demand freedom but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will be kidding the chat of a computer game - and will be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a raw cell under police oaks.
That's what's been happening for many years, and it's going to only go upward, getting bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to end up.
Act with cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were at the class Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
That you take me as the secretary's press.
Ever since, how often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
I'm going to dinner at a dear restaurant once on a patch.
I'll try to explain it to her.)
So we liked it very nice, and we wanted something closer, so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there was a lot of people, and I was tired of energy.
I feel bad about myself, cough, temperature, voice disappeared, weakness, and head spinning
I have to go to that government of work.
We've already done it, but we said who registered in April will only get the money at the end of the month.
We need a pass on Thursday, and we go to a doctor with our children.
But at night I was writing a lady who liked your job, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm going to wait for her new news and I'm going to be sure.
As I worked in the Attorney's Office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a very bad time to lose, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but my love and marriage have taken my heart seriously.
There was a man for whom I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think people should love, respect, trust each other to create a family.
I haven't met that before.
Good day, where do you get the forms in Yyglov to burn a passion (paper or silicone)?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'm going to take the certificate to Valu.
She's got a CPU in lying condition, and she's got a knife broken in a plaster, a wheel in the lying position, and the food's all overflowing in the blender.
Mr. Reyhard, I'm sorry I'm bothering you in a rough time.
But I have a big question to ask you.
I went to the game room in Natalie to say hello to her today.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to look at the things and lay them in that room with her clothes, and Mr. Valerius opened our baby room yesterday until 19:00.
Could that be so?
The room's working hours until 4:00.
Finally, this is our responsibility.
But I don't have a load, I don't get a page that's very weak on the Internet.
The Cola's working well, she's filled the invitations yesterday, and I've been studying with the older men before the exam at the gymnasium.
It's harder to figure out the geometry.
Vladimir helped us on Saturday.
Age studies universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for Our Housing
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill it.
We'll try to get as much money as possible by the end of the week to calculate
The situation concerning Russian invasion — Briefing the leader of Ofis, President Alex Arestovich (10.04.2022)
The president's president's adviser told me about the heroic act of the senior military officer in Mariopolis -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he undermined himself with the radio station so that he wouldn't get to the opponents.
I've got a very important question, will I help put my Grandma on counting her for five years (Bronchial asthma) now she has a ridicule and hoarse...
We need a family doctor to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
A doctor’s advice is urgently needed to be very concerned about her condition.
We live in Czech Dolní Chabry. We need a doctor whose way to go here in Dolni Chabry or somewhere nearby maybe Brno but not far from the subway so we can get.
The butterfly exhibition was enjoyable.
Butterflies sat on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
Oh, my God, I thank you so much, no words, thank you very much.
Mom stands there four o'clock in the morning
Perhaps the mistress will leave his phone for communication.
I still think this house in Prague-8 is the best way to do it.
Mr. Director didn't tell me anything about the possibility of paying a sponsor for the baby's dinner.
They gave me this data for paying.
For part of March and April, I paid for food.
If you had an opportunity to help me pay me for May and June?
What should I do?
Do you want to talk to the headmaster of the school with this question?
Do we go on Mondays or come on Wednesday?,, /
All your friends will know you're communicating with me.
I don't know what to do with what I need to do, and I don't have any housing.
Did you first get out of your relationships or have you left?
I've come from Donetsky, I have medical education, 27 years old, neurological work, massage, liquor physculture for adults and children, my favorite medical manipulations.. speaking Russian and Ukrainian... and the rest of the information, call +420-464-548-072 or write to Vibera +380-42-791-0436.
I was a manicure master, a friend of the manager.
But we know everything, we're Ukraine, and we don't know what we can't learn.)
You Want to Find a Good Helper
I thought it was Monday.
Can I ask you to take me theirs, how do you go home?
I need a tumbler, I can pay the rent.
I don't know what to do.
We need to go to the embassy periodically, and I'm waiting for the documents to be reprocessed, I'm going to ask.
I'm also interested in communicating with you.
