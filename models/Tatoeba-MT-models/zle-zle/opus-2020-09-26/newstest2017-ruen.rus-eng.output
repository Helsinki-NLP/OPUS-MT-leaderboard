28-year-old cooking was found dead in the San Francisco Commercial Center
A 28-year-old cook who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of the local shopping centre this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine someone who wants to hurt him, saying, "He's got a lot of business."
The body found in Westfield Mol on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galisia, reported by the San Francisco Bureau of Forensic Expertise.
The Department of the Police of San Francisco reports that death was classified as murder and investigations continue.

The representative of Sons & Daughters said they were "socked and oppressed" by his death.
"We're a small team that works as a friendly family and it's going to be very missed," said the representative.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galisia said that Frank had first stayed in the hostels, but lately, "He's got a lot of business."
"He found the apartment, he met the girl," Luis Galisia said to KGO.
Luis Galisia said he couldn't imagine someone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
His way of communicating with the family has always been to prepare us for some meal, to prepare us for dinner," said Luis Galisia.
He never wanted to be involved in any controversy.
He was a brother who was sailing through the current.
"With all the bad things that happens to this world, he was the unlimited diamond that brightly shone every day," he said.
All who possess the information are asked to call the SFPD Hot Line at 415-575-4444.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
The international group of biologists concluded that the most prolonged spine animals are the Greenland Polar Shark, which can live for about 500 years, transmits the RT.
Scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eyes of the 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, can be between 272 and 512 years.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism, which leads to slow development, plays an important role in shark’s longevity.
The females of the Greenland sharks are sexually mature only in 150 years.
Previously, it was believed that the longer the spines lived, the shark, the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to scientist was a little over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of Sowbeza RF.

According to Vladimir Putin, Ivan himself asked him to move to another job.
Should we go to a sanatorium if there is no health problem?
Our expert is Olga Bogsh's chief doctor.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need a recreation not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of disease.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his body condition and receive a doctor’s advice on how to live, so that his health will not be destroyed.
Such recommendations would not be too much.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the organism, and shouldn't be thrown away from it.
Strong stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And some 90 per cent of the visitors experience stress.
It is most vulnerable to people from the cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's better not to combine the situation and give yourself some time to rest.
Studies show that 98 per cent of people decline their biological age during their stay in the sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to have a vacation with your children, you don't have to break up with them.
Children, even the smallest, have programmes of health care that include both diagnostic services, paediatric advice, analysis and treatment.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's basins), inhalation, special diet, massage, oxygen cocktails, medicine.
The course of the procedure is defined by a doctor taking into account the individual evidence and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, children's sanatoriums usually operate a child club with animators where children can attend play sessions, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to visitors with infants, provide breastfeeders with the necessary conditions and provide experienced nanny services.
A soft winter, a long summer, an abundance of solar days in the year (over 300) creates good conditions for round-the-clock rest on the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs to rest not only in summer.
So there is no need to be afraid of weather outside the window, since most of the procedures are in the room and no longer depend on the season.
Generally, sanatorium treatment is preferable twice a year, especially for adults.
The main site of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, therapeutic mineral sources: Slavic, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and influence the different systems of the body.
The water varies by temperature, quantity of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor's picking up the water depending on the patient's feelings.
For example, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effect, restoring the functions of the stomach-toxic tract and the exchange of substances.
Essentuki 4 is influencing the stomach tracing, reducing the sugar level.
The Essentuki new performs an anti-inflammatory, yellow and urinary operation.
The same effect is given to the water of "Slavian".
When water is assigned, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it will pick less salt water because salt is deterred by the liquid, resulting in an increase in pressure.
Admission of mineral water requires compliance: water should be drank at a specified time, at the required amount and at a specific temperature.
Different cosmetological procedures for individuals and bodies are now available in sanatoriums.
What kind of healing, based on the natural characteristics of the North Caucasus, can be obtained from the curors in the region?
In the area of Phihorski, for example, there is a salt lake of Tambucan, of which the salt is useful for joints, spines, internal organs.
It provides anti-filling, dispatching, immunomodulating.
These are recreational walks on individually designed routes.
They are particularly popular in Kislobodsk, where there is a huge Curort Park (two sized in Europe).
It is popular in Kislobodsk, which is in the immediate vicinity of the mineral source Narzan.
There are also wine baths, pearls, jewelry, villages, salpheine-lacricians, depending on what a doctor will appoint you.
We'll continue the fertility.
What can you do to make the harvest go by the end of the season?
Tells Julia Belopuchov, agronomist and darling.
The time for the high-sea tomatoes to build a pinch: to remove the new pastures, to cut the mats, to remove all the leaves before the last hand with the fruits and flowers with small ties will not be able to see.
All tomatoes, irrespective of “constitutions”, as well as peppers and bachelors, feed with zola-superphosphate extraction, processed by biporeparats (Direvator, to accelerate the oil and growth of fruits, Fitoponin-M, Fitolauin, Gamar, Baktophyte, Immunocytophyte, to increase immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm, if there are pests).
In the summer, only copper domes, cologne sulphur, and green soap should be used.
We're doing the last plant field.
Long-platistic cucumbers in the heat shall be released from the wallpaper so that the lower, naked part of the stem (25-40 cm) will be slept on the ground, watered by the heat water and the solution of the Zircon, and the stem is placed in the compart.
It is also easy to prolong the fertilization of the rubber: cut the old leaves, pour the warm water, and dissolve the complex fertilization, and sleep the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect yourself from the colds of the night, set up an arc with cover.
Keep the plant's day open, and shut it down after sunset.
The sign of the end.
What indicates that Russia comes out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s withdrawal from the last twenty years of recession.
According to analysts surveyed by the Bloomberg Agency, the GDP of the RF shows positive developments - in the second quarter of GDP declined by 0.8 per cent in the annual term.
This figure has been minimal since the beginning of 2015.
According to recent Rostat, the decline in the Russian economy in the second quarter has slowed to 0.6 per cent.
The stabilization of the situation has also recently been stated by Centralobank and Min economy.
The way ahead is slow growth.
According to CBI experts, the recession in the Russian economy remained in the past.
“Indexual assessment of Russian GDP indicates that the recession remains behind and the future is slow growth of the economy”, says the Russian Bank Banch “What Trading Says.”
The Integrated Assessment of GDP for the current quarter of the regulator has increased to 0.4 per cent, and the fourth quarter estimates are 0.5 per cent.
According to the representative of Min Economy, during the second quarter of the GDP decline, the RF stopped in the second quarter at 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the seasonally purified GDP decline was 0.2 per cent in the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the recession stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June, GDP change was between 0 and 0.15, quoting the MER RIA “Novety”.
The slowing down of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that “the day has passed.”
Among other markers indicating signs of revitalization of the national economy, Bloomberg describes the growth of demand for electricity and rail transport and the recovery of business.
If an adjustment is made to the year of high quality, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
We'll add a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the increase in freight transport, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus-minus 0.5 per cent of semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality,” explains Cyril Jacobenko of BROKER.
There are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, lower price pressure.
In July the consumer price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rostat has been fixing deflation.
The prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the rouble course, which, while showing strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has increased by 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the signs of recovery that must be followed by indicators from the real economy”, stresses Jacobenko.
In addition, industrial production has increased in the FM since April.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7 per cent.
There is a slow down rate of foreign trade from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive trend is also demonstrated in the labour market, where unemployment has declined to 5.4 per cent.
It was only below in September 2015 (5.2 per cent).
Despite the well-being of the labour market, the issue of real income-generating populations should be left to the best.
In the annual term, the figure decreases by 4.8 per cent.
This may hinder the recovery of the economy, as household expenditure contributes significantly to GDP.
Generally, their share is more than 50 per cent in the economy.
In addition to low consumer activity, the strong policy of the Bank of Russia is also a risk to economic growth.
The regulator holds a 10.5 per cent rate, which does not have a better impact on the real sector.
Negative factors are also under-investment levels, which hinder industrial capacity development.
But as a whole, it can be assumed that by the end of the year, the growth of the RF economy will slow down to -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015”, says the HK Forex Club Irena Rogova analyst.
The naturalization process of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well-established in winter sports in the Olympics in Sochi, is not so active in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio are for Russia and former foreigners, it is mostly those of the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process -- quite a large number of Russians are under the flags of other States.
In each case, the history of the change in nationality differs.
Some of the parents have taken to another country as a child without leaving a choice.
Someone has failed to stand for a place in the Russian fees.
Some thought that there would be better conditions for sports to develop abroad.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian nationality.
In a German passport, a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But before, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in Omsk in 1988.
A total of four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There, she decided to follow the steps of her older sister, to engage in a light athletics.
Like a sister, Lisa chose a sixth jump.
Stay in Russia, I'm unlikely to be able to move Elena Isinbaev from the throne.
Unfortunately, the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only countryman, although former, in the sixth-six jump sector.
Its best accomplishments in this form of sport are the 2010 Bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental primitive in 2016, which it won again in the absence of Helena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozkova was born in Novocuznetk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the gospel.
Because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Helena, eight other children were raised in the family.
They all lived in a small town in Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in the fight at school.
In showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where another former Russian, Vladislava Izbajnikov, had continued her training at the United States Training Centre.
In the 2012 Olympics, Helena lost in her first fight in London.
But that year's world championship is winning.
Before that, she had, by the way, won the world's primary silver in 2010.
Thereafter, there were Bronze 2013 and silver 2014.
The 26-year-old Mary was born in the city of Jaroslavla, where she first met the synchronous swimming.
But it would be wrong to say that it was brought up by our trainers in Russia.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon it was part of the United States assembly and showed excellent results in Pan American games.
It is understandable that, at the serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, its ceilings.
The new name, which Russianly sounds weird, was received by Cristina Shaldibin at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue to teach the girl the art gymnastics over the ocean.
Until then, the girl had taken a favorite sport in Jaroslavle’s family.
After emigrating in the United States, she quickly entered the youth assembly of the country and later entered the main national team.
At Pan American games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She did not have to fight for her first positions on the world scene, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough -- she brought out a star-burst assembly at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our ex-worms is Janrezco-Marggrander, who is in favour of Germany's assembly.
She was born in Toljatti.
In 2008, at the age of 13, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had more prospects for national assembly.
Soon she was presenting her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It was true that Jana was able to take only 17 places that were not sufficient to get into the final competitions in personal primacy.
But two years earlier, she was able to win the Olympics Bronze Medal.
Another gymnast, only this time a sports woman, Irena Sazoneov.
If the emigration of the athletes mentioned earlier could be called standard, the choice of the Irena family was very unusual, Iceland.
Ira is the tutor of the Volgograd Sports School.
In Iceland, of course, she immediately became a champion of the country.
True, Ira is still trained in Russia, and he comes to his homeland specifically so that he does not lose his skills.
In Rio, she didn't do as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal multibar.
There is very little information about Maria Ugolkova's swimming in Russian information space.
Maria lives and trains in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time, she has been under the Russian flag, showing good results -- even the record of the country's 200-metres batterfly distance.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to speak under a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best address is 14 in an integrated 4x100 estaphite.
To get to play, the girl launched a storing project that enabled her to collect some 6,000 francs that allowed her to pay for her training for Olympics.
Adam Batirov, a 31-year-old free style fighter, spent almost all his career under the Russian flag.
In the meantime, Hasauvurta has been a three - time harbor of European championships, Russia’s champion of sports in Russia’s international class.
When he stopped entering our national assembly, it was time to think about the change of nationality.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from sports.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian championship - Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which the gold medal won and was travelled to Olympics in Rio.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Dyunov, is even less aware of the Swiss sailor, Maria Hulkov.
The fact is, his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very small.
That's where Mikhail started sporting gymnastics.
It has not made great progress at the international level.
In Rio, the best result was 40 seats in parallel bruises.
But for New Zealand, even hitting the Olympic Games in a sports hymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Nasta, born in Moscow in 1985, was only nine, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her exercise in synchronous navigation, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championship in Berlin, the girl took the 6th place in synchronous navigation.
In a duet with Eugenia, Tetelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
In a salt program, she was five.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroitter is in favour of the assembly of Israel.
When he was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
During 2009, at 17 years of age, Dmitry was already a champion of the country.
That same year he won the world's youth championship.
A year later, Croiter also wins the gold of the Olympic Young Games in Singapore.
Dmitry, in addition to leaping at a height, jumps in length and triple jumps.
Albert, 31-year-old, is another Hasauvurta, who, after a long presentation for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which would be represented in Rio.
In Russia, however, he spoke for the Higher Sports School of Krasnoyarsk, even becoming a champion in 2011.
The 28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR team on the volleyball of Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before Jaroslav's son was born, he was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained permanent.
In 2015, he was a national team with a bronze of the European championship held in the territory of his new homeland.
Hajiev was born in Chechnya in 1994, and he joined his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to go to that northern country -- it had to go to France, to Nitz.
There Zelimhan continued to learn the free struggle.
Soon he won the first peace among the youths and later qualified to participate in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the fight tournament.
Again, free fight, and again the former Russian.
This time, this is about the North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain, about Timuras Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is now in favour of the team assembled in that country.
In fact, 30-year-old athletes have also seen high results in Russia.
It has become the 2007 and 2008 bronze support for championships.
The statute of non-contributors, Timeuras, decided to change sports citizenship.
The last one on our list is the Chechen boxer born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Mahakale, Arthur Biarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, the parents took the family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began a boxing exercise.
Since then, Arthur has become a champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he has become a champion of peace among young people.
In 2015, the gold of the Pan American games won the Bearslanes, the first of which was his new homeland since 1975.

Why do the kids in the school cascades?
According to Governor B. Kondrivevyev, "proofs need to be nurtured, not by actions and parades, but by systems."
They have to grow up and, at least, since 7 years of age, realize that they have to be cossacks and education must be cosmic.
But as long as I think this work is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Kassaki classes take on all the positive things previously accumulated at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If we're all stubborn and we don't know how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
The FMC continues to be one of the most criminal sectors in the country's economy.
There is an infringement of funds for utilities from budgets at different levels.
According to Genprocuratoria, overstated tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the area of FMC.
As a result, the consumers of the region overpayed more than 170 million roubles of energy.
During the days and the Office of the Procurator of the Krasnodar province, the facts of the incorporation of unwarranted costs into the tariffs have been identified.
In addition, 4 million roubles were placed in the IB-consulting (for cold water) for rental of cars at a price higher than the market.
And such examples are masses in the country.
The people pay the last money for the “communal”, which is correctly paid, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the average collection of payments from the population is 94 per cent.
He is accused immediately of several articles of the Criminal Code: disbursement, legalization of proceeds obtained by criminal means, abuse of powers, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund involved in the renovation of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually carried out but paid.
Businessmen were just returning him most of the money.
As UK master, Makarov collected money from the population, but the service providers did not pay and spend it on their needs.
As a result, the budget and the inhabitants are affected by millions of roubles.
Macarov's scheme, the bites typical of Russia.
There has been a wave of arrests and detentions by UK leaders who have committed citizens' money.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan is ongoing, by the way, to the former roster deputy, who is charged with roubles of 91.7 million roubles.
According to the investigation version, in 2012-2013, he established 6 companies in Elivo Kamchatka province and established 3 societies with limited responsibility.
One of them was contract work for the UK, the other two played the role of counting centres, that is, taking money from the population.
However, the energy of A. Kohan did not count the funds but was spent on himself, my loved one.
It is quite difficult to deal with in the area of FMC.
They don't get excited, they're protracted.
And “helps” in this extremely confused housing legislation, according to Svetlan Ravoreva, executive director of the NP, “HCH Control”.
We're not able to make one law, as we're going to think of a new one that must be forced to work the previous one.
There are also few experts, including judges, on FMC issues.
Lawyers themselves are recognized that housing law is being given very little attention.
The refusal to file criminal cases, the fiber during the investigations, are also reported in Hencourtura.
Of the 3.5,000 crimes in 2015, less than half are sent to the courts.
The remainder of the investigation has been prolonged and each fifth has been suspended due to the failure of the accused.
There are often deficiencies in the law enforcement system that are written off on gaps in the legislation in force.
The law is, but the investigative authorities do not hastily initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting, and only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
In 5 months of this year, the number increased only slightly to 99.
What is the falsification of the report of the householder's meeting?
This means that the change in home management, financial and other issues are circumventing the views of owners.
This also means that housing and communal services cannot be marketed by normal companies that want to work honestly rather than to reach the population.
So it turns out the poor, the small and medium-sized business, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in all States, Anton Jarkov is confident that he is a member of the Property Committee.
This work is now being actively carried out.
It's not just single action, it's a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions have such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital does not smell like scandals.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the area of MCH, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital Government has exercised iron will and ordered, “Aife” Anatoliy is an Electronic member of the Security and Counter-Corruption Committee.
I am referring to both the human resources issue and legislative amendments and legal education.
Governing companies have been supervised and they have all been licensed.
Citizens are promptly resolved in public space (and the treatment of the residents and the responses are placed on the Moscow Government portal).
Many not just pay monthly receipts but watch carefully what it says about the house.
The awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource- and managerial organizations is very high.
Plus Moscow verifys the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services, as a large part of the budget is for subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
Probably all of this together, explaining the calm situation in Moscow.
It's out, it's all in the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe you should change your place of work.
Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to renounce friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Rejep Taip Erdogan, sent the United States an ultimatum, proposing a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher charged with the coup d'état.
He said that by speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to renounce their support for the “terrorist organization of fethullahists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the US is calling for a change of position.
Experts believe that the division between Turkey and the West is increasing and can lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Rano or late America will make a choice between Turkey and FETO.”
Either a coup d ' éta, or a democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice,” quotes the Anatolic Agency for Erdogan's treatment, which was delivered on Wednesday night in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once again, but he demanded the U.S. more severely to comply with his demand for the first time after the oppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of 16 July in Turkey, the high-ranking representatives of the Turkish Army attempted to overthrow the legitimacy of the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the Head of State.
However, after Regep Erdogan addressed the people, the rebellion was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
A total of 8,000 people were suspected, and teachers and scientists were found in the ranks other than the military.
Regep Erdogan is of the opinion that their mentor was Fethulah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also assumed that in the hospital, Americans could be involved.
All claims had been challenged by Gülena, refusing to issue and proposing a change in tone.
The last statement by the representatives of the Lord in this regard was made at the time of the visit of Erdogan to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
This does not, however, stop the President of Turkey -- he insists on his own and also demands other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to comply with its obligations under a migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not call the date of the lifting of visas for Turkish citizens”, the Minister of Turkey for EU Affairs of Omer Chelik stated on 9 August.
He said that the introduction of Ankara ' s changes to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe ' s own security.
We note that on 1 August, Zigmar Gabriel, the German vice-cancellor, demanded that Turkey cease the blackmail of the European Union by promises to open borders for migrants in order to facilitate the visas regime from the EU.
His words responded to the relevant statement by the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Turkey, Melluth Chavushulu.
Another provocative statement by Chavousoglus made on the past Wednesday, arguing that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not excluded that the country will consider leaving an alliance unless it receives the expected support.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign States in the defence sphere, importing missiles,” said Chawashoglu in an interview with the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey should now establish its own defence system on the basis of its technology and cooperate with other countries.
“To date, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but we have not been satisfied and we are looking for others,” said the Minister.
Experts believe that all of this reflects Turkey ' s serious differences with the West and its reorientation to the East.
The Head of the International Institute for Political Experts, Eugenius Minchenko, believes that Rejep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a rigid confrontation with the West.
He has very much to do with the West and from the point of view of business, and from the point of view of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance the framework with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see at this post as a fully obedient person," the expert explained to Aif.ru.
He said that it would be pressured upon the Turkish leader ' s statements (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the demand for non-visual space with Europe and the issuance of Gulen from the United States).
“Rejep Erdogan will face the deterioration of relations with the Americas and with the European Union, which will be jeopardized by humanitarian issues, dictatorships for the country and so forth,” he considers Minchenko.
The head of the Centre for Political Information, Alexey Muhin, admits that the President of Turkey will change his view with Russia as soon as he becomes profitable.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took a very strong stand against Russia and sought favor in all ways in the West.
In a very small time, the situation changed to the opposite.
Guarantee that the President of Turkey will not change his priorities again after a while, no.
I think Erdogan entered the period of human diplomacy.
He's going to be between the two poles, the West and Russia, and he's going to try to gain the maximum benefit for himself," he thinks Muhin.
In his view, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin to stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, consensus with Turkey will be reached”, the expert believes.
The head of the Centre for Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasov, is different.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the United States are now quite tense, and this is primarily related to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated and, in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot policies in both the Middle East and Russia.
The President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, have stated that they are willing to change their position on a number of Syrian issues, resolved their relations with Israel, and actively interacted with Iran,” explained Aif.ru Glasov, suggesting that the next step would be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said that the policy that Erdogan had now pursued was the return to the course of the foreign policy concept followed by Turkey before the Arab revolution.
“In the same way, in the “no problems with neighbours” positions, Turkey has begun to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The President of Turkey to Russia and the African countries have now received a very successful visit.
The external policy vector will therefore be developed and will enhance Turkey's positions both in the regional and international arenas”, the expert believes.
It is the view of the eyes that returning Turkey to the former relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, and now the question is whether the EU will respond rigidly to Turkey, which can open borders for migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Suggestion of junior doctors: Call for new collective protests
Representatives of junior doctors requested the trade union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over the new labour contract.
The Committee of Junior Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is about to request its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC said that the Ministers had failed to respond to labour contract questions.
The Junior Doctors and Medical Students voted in July for the lifting of the BMA labour contract.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who voted in secret ballot.
In a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, Chairman JDC Ellen McCort said that the Government continued to “continue to keep silent” about the problems she said led to the rejection of the labour contract.
She said, “In considering the current situation, the JDC leader voted for rejecting the proposed new labour contract in full volume and called for formal renegotiations on all your matters”.
In response to the silence of the Government, the JDC leader has now made a formal request for an extraordinary BMA Council meeting to endorse the continuing programme of expansion of collective protests since early September.
The argument led young doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavan, resigned after a vote for the lifting of the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members that the transaction was a good deal to be adopted during the meetings prior to the vote of 54,000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the labour contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey, "Alias Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in a golden palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yeah.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed tense, and he barely emitted heat even on his own restraint standards.
Regep Tayip Erdogan spoke in contrast on several occasions of his “a dear friend” to Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the protracted coolness from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the crisis was the first one he mentioned in the introductory comments: Turkey defeated the Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that point was frantic.
Mr. Putin burst into an angry tyranny, accusing Ankara of Moscow's blow in the back.
Insult was even stronger on the basis of a supposed friend.
Recovery of real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During the months, the media controlled by the State carried out a shocking, total attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, the Turks were supposed to be guilty of everything.
The most serious accusations from senior officials were that Mr. Erdogan's own family had relied on the illegal trade in oil from Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting took place only because Mr. Putin was apologized to President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of announcement of truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrown from his post last month in an attempt to couple.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him, too.
There is also a economic cause.
Russian sanctions have been severely attacked — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, tourists and charter companies here, of course, will be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're putting the end of the season in the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, public television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"The tourists, the tomatoes back here," as the report said in the Welfare newspaper.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because she thinks it's a weak answer to an attempt at a coup.
Add to this the long-standing dissatisfaction of her turtle talks about accession to the EU and the step of Mr. Putin, who seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroy Turkish relations with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won the bonus scores with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after an attempt to coup d ' état.
Bear in mind, this is a tribute to Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of changing the regime.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described as a bad alliance: two countries, who feel rejected and humiliated by the West, unite forces.
Nevertheless, despite the public demonstration of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
Perhaps it is for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two Presidents had a press conference, they had not even touched on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to the question of their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility -- and taking into account the possibility of a complete catastrophe when the NATO member of Turkey struck down a Russian fighter -- it is better that two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for clients outside Scotland
Brand RBS should be confined to the role of bec-offis, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told the BBC of Scotland that brand RBS was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has departed from them since he nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be saved.
During this period, brand strategies used “RBS” to protect other consumer lending brands.
It has been supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sport, from the six regbi nations to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But it was now decided that it was right to allow more national brands to go out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scotland clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including an external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Brend Ulster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking private services that will have more influence — Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during the tour of clients and staff at Invernessshire.
He said to BBC Scotland, "Brend RBS will ultimately become our investment brand and the one in which our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming a greater brand bank."
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I now say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their groups, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the six nations Cube, and it will increase the profile of various brands in sponsoring sports.
"This is a good time for us to move a bank of brands, because on the basis (we were asking ourselves) how do we focus on improving the customer bank?" said the executive director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great customer bank and close all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on customer needs, not on our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can get these brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettors comes to 3,000 winners winning in Newmarket in Prostration
Children spray champagne after the duplicate in Newmarket brings him to 3,000 winners.
Joke Frankie Dettory won his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with his second winner of the night on his home track -- on the passion trained by John Hosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth juke, which has reached this outstanding mark in smooth leaps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lestor Piggott, Pat Iddery and Willy Carson.
The three-fold champion of the fiber Dettor, who once won Ghayar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here, too.
I'm very glad it happened in Newmarket, because that's where I lived 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a normal Friday evening of 20,000 people.
I'm free from business and I'm very untiring.
Children take applause when they bring the Prejudice after the victory
Two rogues have reached this mark in hurdles: Richard Johnson's beetle champion and the 20-fold retired champion Sir Anthony McKey, who won over 4,300 wins for a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best trokes of the modern era, and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before it.
He's styley and strong, but it's his tactical mixture that distinguishes him from the others in the weighing room.
He was a great representative for jumping, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a buzzer of weekends and big jumps!
And if seriously, Frankie brought the winners in Britain for more than 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character that's good for British jumps, but more than that, he's an incredibly joking.
Frankie Dittori celebrated this outstanding mark by a firm steep buck with a horse
Frankie Dettori is a symbol of British smooth leaps for two decades, from the rapid finishes to the fast-growing leaps.
They were blows and falls.
Many of the winners of large jumps, including his famous Big Semek in Ascota in 1996, but he also survived the air accident and was disqualified because of the doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed an enormous force of will to challenge skepticism and return to form.
And he may not have finished for a while — the children had previously said that they would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least up to 50 years of age.
Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanova's head of administration
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly fired his head of administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Job was part of the trusted Middle Circle of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for environment and transport.
The statement from the Kremlin states that Putin "reasoned to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian administration of the President," but did not mention the reason.
Mr. Ivanova, Deputy to Mr. Ivanov, Anton Weino, has been appointed his successor since 2012.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
Tallina, born in Estonian capital in 1972, ended the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IGMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later head of the President ' s and Government ' s protocol management, reports the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as Heads of State in the formulation of draft laws and in the monitoring of how your direction is being implemented.
Putin reported to a Russian telecommunication on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released and recommended that Weino replace him.
Do you think smiles are promising?
It's a move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, as he has served in the Soviet Security Service, the CGB.
As head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on State television, both men stated that the head of the administration had resigned according to his own desire.
Despite the smiles on the camera, few people have been convinced here — especially now, right before parliamentary elections.
So these are the unforeseen consequences of some struggle for power?
Until no one knows.
But the official statement -- that the person who was once aggressed as a potential president -- suddenly wanted to control Russian environmental policy -- was met with a huge skepticism.
In Putin's comments quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It's true that in early 2012 I asked you to trust me with this very difficult post, even a problemful post, for four years.
Well, it turns out I was head of the Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.
Ivan entered the post in December 2011.
He had previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He was a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the KGB State Security Service, as was Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the CGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of the five people to whom he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could be president of Russia after the second term of Putin, since the third term for Putin would be contrary to the Constitution.
However, there was another close supporter, Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became the Prime Minister before he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was a participant in the Los Angeles show footage last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in films and divergence.
I am sorry that this has happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information on how the character of Gibson will be removed from the show that the FBI agent team is expected to follow, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
A 54-year-old actor who had previously played a major role in Darma and Greg's retina was on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love to think as a criminal and to put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his Friday statement.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it's not going to be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our great team, and, most importantly, the best worshipers that the show could only dream about.
It's supposed to come back with its twelfth season on September 28th.
Mystery: Fishers landed in the garden of Banff
A man from Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bayne believes that 75 fish could be sands left behind by a watery merchard.
Bein, who lives in 500 meters from the sea, took a screenshot of this sight to Periscope, hoping that someone would be able to shed light on the appearance of two dume fish.
Quinsferri Krossing: The bridge is now connected to Faif.
The $1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern passage and Quinsferri Krossing, which means that the bridge is now connected with Faif.
This is the first of the four tubes between the canvas that are now close to the completion of all three pilots of the bridge.
The Faif Bridge Section is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bunk of bridge.
The $1.35 billion project should now be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Economics, Kit Brown, visited the site today and was among the first to walk from land to bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crosing.
We are all witnesses of engineering, indeed, of an epical scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the end of the leakage between the Viadhuk and the bridge canvas is a virtual operation using extremely accurate prescriptions for assembly.
A total of about 79% of all the bridge canvas are now on the ground, and for the last section of the canvas, the concrete cover is being poured into Rosate today, which means that all the canvas are ready to take place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said, "The first stroke on each bridge project is always a milestone.
In this amazing project, this twist is the most modern construction art.
After setting up the last section of the road canvas and connecting it to the expanding North Pilot road canvas, we were left to close the remaining visas on the north side — or on the side to the shore.
This has been done by extending the North Approach to 700 millimeters souther than this.
It was a massive and very elegant operation at the same time.
Large because the diameter is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be lifted up by a slope of about 3%.
It's beautiful because the tolerances that the team was working on were tiny — just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, all of this went well.
Rescue in the Gulf of Moelfr: Three men are lucky to survive.
Three men were lucky to survive after they were thrown out of the fishing ship to England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised alarm at 13:20 on British summer time on Friday, after the team saw an accident in the Moelfr Gulf.
Three men tried hard to get to a safe place while their vessel continued its journey.
"We've seen their ship shining next to them and supposed to be the worst," said the Moelfre Wins Jones steering salvage boat.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down on the water, a strong wind took him away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and the third man 60 years of age was found to be frustrated and dragged into a bush without a lifesaving waist.
All of them were taken on board a shoreboat and taken to the rescue station.
Jones said, "Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely undamaged.
The boat's engine had an accidental blurr, but it somehow stuck away from the man who managed the boat when it woke up.
Somebody's been protecting these guys today.
Pokémon Go, deserving of health and happiness
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that adolescents and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their leisure time watching the screens, has been a complaint for many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is taking people away from the couch and engaging in some physical activity.
The time on the screen was originally limited to television, then video games, and lately to smartphones.
It's so good to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the total enthusiasm that Pokémon Go is, based on the characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (the resulting series of cartoons, game maps and other responses).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this has lost its relevance sometime earlier than this new game has become available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was detained because of the massive response that had overloaded the servers.
In the few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, smartphone players are going to look for Pokemons who are tracking GPS and when they're detected, they can be "photographed" (with a screenshot on your phone) or "catched."
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined a fantastic enthusiasm, departing from the couches for search.
In the United States, the game has resulted in a significant increase in the number of steps being taken by the “usual” person every day.
Cardiogram, an Apple Watch application that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that within two days of the start of the game, the number of people tracking them, who were doing 30 minute exercises every day, jumped from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary level-trafficking data.
Many health campaigns that persuade people to find 30 minutes, get out of the couch and be active every day have not found response because most health-related messages are boring and voiced by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Regular exercise reduces the risk of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps to adjust weight, high arterial pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that she's pulling people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three basics of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends to hunt.
As usual, there are boring boring moulds looking for anything you ask for.
And yes, someone can hit the door.
So what?
There's a breakthrough.
Because despite the fact that Smartphone applications, such as Fitbit, were able to track our physical activity before, they didn't give us a reason to do things like this game gives us.
The news will come, and the use will be weakened over time.
However, due to the success of the Pokemon, more games will come up to combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people to be more active, in good form and healthy.

Simon Bayles wins the gold of absolute primacy in women's gymnastics.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the mortgage.
Simon Byles is intimidating for all of this.
Dynamic on the back jump.
Not forced on the log.
Awesome on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympics champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of the champion on Thursday, putting the gap between himself and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under the adjacent Olympic attention.
Her total score was 62.198 at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and the Final Penerca team, Ali Rysman, and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustaphina.
Byles of the United States is a gymnastic log at the end of the female individual absolute primacy of artistic gymnastics at the 2016 summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became a fourth consecutive American woman who won the title of an absolute primacy champion and the fifth in general, storing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps at any time.
She was sobbed when she was shown her final general score and her long journey to this point ended.
This accomplishment puts it in the same league as rare athletes, such as Michael Felps, who have raised their sports to new altitudes:
Byles has spent the last three years dominating sports, winning 15 medals of the world championship -- including 10 gold -- with such awesome programmes in their mixture of labor and accuracy that Mary Lou Retton called the 1984 Olympics Championship “the greatest gymnast I have ever seen”.
One last test was in Brazil, the competition was not the same as between Byles and others in this area, but between it and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family's home in Spring, Texas, with a throat of gold medals, would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simon Bales of the United States, on the left, and Ali Riceman are hugging after the winning of gold and silver, respectively, in the finals of the female individual absolute art gymnastics in the summer Olympic Games, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Byles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final accord for the farewell party of the resigning coordinator of the national assembly of Marta Carolie.
While Byles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that's not exactly the case.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her firm passage, is set up on Latin American music, which would come right outside of the Olympic Arena Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandfather and grandparents as a child starts walking and an open mother to Amy Burman during her visit to the hall where Burman was a coach became a force.
It has not lost any competition for absolute primacy since the summer of 2013 — a blizzard that must continue for as long as Bails wants it.
Despite the small advantage of two moves, Mustafina was a mirage.
Gymnastic logs and free exercises — where Byles protects the name of the world champion — lie in the foundation.
It went forward again from 15.43 on the log and ended with 15.93 on the floor.
Rysman gently embraced her while they waited for the final account -- the pure formality -- and tears came around the brilliant red with the white and blue subводs for the eyes of Bales, when the design she had once written in the album for cuts was realized.
Rysmann was a small revenge for four years ago when she was sharing a third place, but lost Mustaphina's bronze in a tai-brace.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that the Americans call the "Grandma" was far ahead.
She sent a crowd of kisses after her free exercise covered by return, which sometimes seemed to be questioned.
With regard to Byles, the viral tweet of 19 years since the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the serial killer case shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the most deadly attack in the first Serial Finicks murderer in the last decade were sitting in the car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports published on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Lainer, Stephanie R. Ellis and daughter Ellis, Malia, were shot down on June 12, when their car was parked on the carriageway, the authorities announced.
The criminal fired about eight pistols standing on the passenger side of the car, after which he escaped on another vehicle, reports the report.
The police claim that the triple murder does not seem to be a result of robbery, since the wrongdoer did not take the wallets or $2,900 at the disposal of an adult victim.
The representative of the Finix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, stated that the shooting had prompted investigators to check whether he was connected to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded as a result of nine attacks in two principally Latin American areas within four months.
"It's happening in a living area in front of the house," said Howard KPHO, a branch office of CBS, at the beginning of this month.
The suspect is expected to have used several vehicles, including brown Nissan in the late 1990s, black BMW in the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Lainer, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died on the ground.
The Witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shooting of an empty peak in half an hour before the three murders, which was believed to have been a serial killer's hand.
The investigators found guilses and extracted a bullet from the seat and pieces of a bullet from the motor-cell.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalia: "Standing Better."
As most six-year-olds, Edmund Pyxivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund’s microcephalia was the result of a genetic violation that his mother, Elizabeth Pixivto, did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't sign up on this.
That's not really true, of course you're signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he could not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized facility.
"My first answer was, "I didn't think people were doing that," explained Pyxivto.
Edmund's walking through the hounds.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he turned three, and he still doesn't say.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks outside and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund invented for "please, sing me."
"We're teaching him the sign language," said Pyxivto CBS News.
But not just the regular sign language — she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephalia may arise as a result of a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmund, during pregnancy from such viruses as measles and Zica.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It's too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those infected with Zick's virus.
Picywto remembers emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
I've been telling you all the time what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I really didn't ask for a lifetime forecast, because I don't expect someone to really tell me.
But Pyxivto has a encouraging council for mothers of children with congenital defects because of Zic.
It's going to be better.
You know everything's gonna be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding is the cause of rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more precipitation expected to fall over the State until Saturday inclusive.
Many rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and south of Mississippi have left the shores and threatened large-scale floods after extreme rainfall, reported the National Meteorological Service.
Governor Louisiana John Bell Edwards stated that government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance had already gone to the affected.
Mike Steel, representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, stated that requests for high-water, boats and sand bags were being made.
Steel said it was just Tanjipahoa's coming to request tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood risk remains valid until Saturday in most of the south of Louisiana.
The meteo service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could slip into the area.
In southern Alabama, flooding was on track until Friday, as the rain continued to rain in the Mobil area.
The River Comit next to Bathon Rouge and the Amit River next to Dene Springs, both in Louisiana, it was projected to establish a record of the flooding level in the past weekends.
Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburban areas near Baton Ruja.
He also said that the flooding downstream at Assenchen's coming was a threat, as these ascending rivers would slowly flow into Lake Morpah.
The Ticco River, just south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest of any registered levels at 9 a.m. in Friday.
The rescuers have still taken people out of the Amit and Wilkinson Flood in the south-west of the state of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and pastures were among the rescued early on Friday near Glossphere.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the waters of Biver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his house, have risen rapidly in the night.
He said that another pasture who lives nearby warned him.
"We're awake, and the water continues to come," said Hansford.
It reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford that it was the greatest influenza she had seen in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family had disability, and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that the rescue officers rescued all three of them by means of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hiding on Friday.
Kroutmann says the flood is “speed rapidly” as the rain continues, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Kroutmann says that one observer near Livingston reported a rainfall of 13.75 inches from midnight to Friday.
Kroutmann said that the soil was resumptioned by rainfall from the environment.
The heavy rain and the flooding of the streets led to work to save people from houses at the arrival of Tanjipahoa and to cancel their studies in five school districts, and the authorities state.
WWL, a CBS branch office, reports that counselor Tanjipahoa told about 200 flooded homes.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
Robbie Miller, Chairman of the visit, stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven high-water domestic animals.
The shelters were opened in the city of Amit and in the city of Hammond to accept the evacuated.
"They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat," he said.
In the city of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed because of the high level of water, and sand bags were available to deliver to the people, hoping that they would hold water away from houses and businesses.
"The last major flood we had in March," said the city manager Lacey Lundrum.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, head of the Emergency Service, Rupert Lacey reported that the siege rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that several houses had been recorded as flooded on Thursday, but no one had been registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, director of the Shopper Value Foods store in Amit, lives in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Tausson, "and she's still pouring on the ground."
Majaz Brown, 6 "resolved by bullets" remains alive after the firing in Philadelphia.
The police report that in Philadelphia, a six-year-old boy was shot, registering the second shooting in a six-year-old in town this week.
Grandmother and grandfather identified him for the CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandparents say Brown received numerous firearms, including his smell, foot, hand and stomach, but was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He's got a lot of it, his little body was removed by bullets," says his grandmother Delérez Melandez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that he was expected to get better.
He was supposed to go to first grade in local primary school.
Brown was one of the four people who were shot in the Jermantown quarter.
Three men were also shot, two 29 years old and one 32 years old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reportedly in critical condition; two other victims were registered in stable condition, according to the CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, reports the station.
Two other victims weren't in the car, and the police were investigating whether any wounded men could be shot.
The investigators report to the CBS Philadelphia that there appeared to be a shooting between several armed people.
Hills from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to various copies of semi-automatic weapons, seized the place of action.
It seems that it was definitely a long battle.
There were guilles on the street, on both sides of the pavement.
Therefore, it appears that there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the Philadelphia Captain Anthony Ginaldi police station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also stolen.
No arrests have been made, and the police are reported to watch cameras.
Another six-year-old child, a girl, was struck in the hand of the helmet bullets Tuesday when she played in front of her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why We Need Simon, Gabbie and Laurie
That's what I call a woman's Olympic gymnastics collection this year and for several reasons.
First, I've been to every summer of Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And the second is that three gymnasts play a key role: Simon Bayles, Gabbie Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernández, who have already inspired so many non-godly girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Ali Rysman, Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This collection looks like America at last.
This has also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the female gymnast number one has been African American.
Last year Simon and Gabbie were number 1 and number 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabbie Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed welcome.
The world could now have witnessed the incredible statements of the three-fold World Championship of Simon Bayles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, which were performing unexpected, yet virtual, gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became a fourth American consecutively winner of gold in a female absolute primacy.
And Ali Rysman's collecting colleague earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like this in the gymnastic sections throughout the country.
Simon, Gabbie and Laurie all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form an Olympic assembly.
They're the final five, because the next Olympic gymnastic assembly will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Marta Carolie's training.
But, in fact, gymnastics are expensive sports, and gymnasts are first trained in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay for the cost of learning, equipment, travel, form, contributions for competition, hotels (for trainers and their gymnasts and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas, which can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get everything from their training, and it's a expensive and long-term responsibility for the gymnast families.
Amy Burman, the coacher of Simon Bayles, and Maggie Hany, coach Lorry Hernández, both trained their athletes since they accepted the gymnastics.
We must create a more affordable and affordable training of gymnastics among the insignificant number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabbie and Lori.
I founded my gymnastic fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive exercises of gymnastics located in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin American) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality hymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the sustainability of debilitating work, discipline and mental resilience.
This combination has had a lifelong positive effect on good health, school success and work.
It is the inspiration of this gathering that will send thousands of girls into gymnastics, and that's great.
Sports are so important, especially for girls.
It's a great time.
Thank you, Simon, Ali, Laurie, Gabbie, and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Women's Power in the winner of Olympic Gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors took up an announcement of further strikes following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped to conclude a dispute over the changes by agreeing with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had participated in the voting had rejected it.
In July, Hunte announced plans for the treaty, saying that NHS was on "no land" and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in work at night and weekends to improve service at out-of-time.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Committee of Young Physicians, said last night in a statement: “Any younger doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will bolster the existing labour crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors justly.”
It was only eight weeks before the first team of doctors was transferred to a new contract, progress was needed and time was needed.
Attempts by IMA to resolve the dispute by negotiation have been met by the reluctance to act and, at times, the silence of the Government.
And that's notwithstanding Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremimy Hunt must act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he doesn't, then younger doctors are clear that they're willing to organize further strikes.
The latter in late April postponed some 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure the replacement of doctors on the piceting line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude a dispute over changes by agreeing with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better payment for the 54,000 younger doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS Employers, called on younger doctors not to continue strikes.
Mortimer stated: “Strikes reach little or nothing, but pressure already running teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorder to patients, nurses and their families.”
During the past two months, we have talked to the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Workers hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics, such as the distribution of staff, the flexibility of training, additional training for those returning after a career break, the cost of learning, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender disparities in pay in medicine, were a sign of how serious employers, health education in England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use a medication for two pounds a day after the authorities have recommended that it be given more people and for longer periods of time.
The anti-refoulement tycagralor reduces the risk of recycling for people with cardiovascular diseases.
The stop is 12 months after the heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Supervisory Service of the British National Health Service recommended that it be given to people for four years in order to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE Supervisory Service of the British National Health Service has now recommended that it be given to the people for four years to further eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140,000 people in England each year, with a quarter of them having another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of accumulation of fat material on the walls of arteries and formation of blades.
If the blade breaks into pieces, it can cause a trunk that blocks the blood’s access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the tromble moves, he can move through the blood flow and block the bleed to the brain by calling the stroke.
People who have had one attack are more at risk of getting another.
The Tikagror, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under Brilique, reduces the risk by making the trams less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelore for 12 months, followed by 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Centre, said: “Notwithstanding the existence of effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of those who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life.
There is evidence that cycagralor, coupled with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already undergone a heart attack.
Preliminaryly recommending a ticagrelore, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of the ticagrelore — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited over the past three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than that.
The culture of ownership of PC allows for falsification of votes in Muslim areas
Ex-Mair Tauer-Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year because of corruption, serving as a key to the Government's report
The culture of political correctiveness has led to the closing of the eyes, which has resulted in a widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the disastrous report of the Government that has been promulgated today.
Sir Eric Pickles, a former Cabinet member, is criticized by the police, electoral observers and urban administration for ignoring evidence of electoral violations due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion”.
The former secretary of the local communities, now an anti-corruption king, reported that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police should allow borders beyond the electoral sections to be protected by fearful voters.
He suggests that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
To date, voters should simply specify their name and address.
The report even suggests that ink be put on the fingers of people when they give their ballot papers, so that someone can vote twice.
There is a need for better protection to informers, said Sir Eric.
He called for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups to the press.
“It is not only to protect itself from fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of a scandal in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court dealing with electoral matters decided that the existing mayor of Luftur Rahman had to be removed from the post in connection with the long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman was told, "Bringing his campaign on the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes doubted or were the result of personation when a person voted, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns about fraud with a mail in which senior Muslim members reportedly put pressure on people to vote for the candidate they selected.
Sir Eric, in his photograph, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the requirement to bring his identity to prove who you are.
The report states: “There have been evidence of pressure on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to vote by the will of older persons, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
“There were fears that... public institutions had closed their eyes to such conduct because of the excessive sensitivity of “political correctiveness” regarding ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations for the cleaning of the system, including the removal of political activists from the postal ballots to stop the “feeding of votes”.
The report, before Teresa May, also calls for extensive registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration fraud and privileges.
An option is being considered to require voters to issue a identity certificate before the vote.
Use inkless on the fingers of people as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To conduct systematic verification of the nationality of people to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal balloting.
To remove political participants in campaigns and activists from working with completed strikes and postal envelopes.
To empower the police to establish borders around the electoral sections.
Amend the law to facilitate the prosecution of intimidation according to the 1983 People ' s Act.
Illegal photography at polling stations.
To require that only English be used in polling stations (excluding Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that the staff make the voters go to the barrel alone.
Sir Erik ruthlessly attacks the city police, claiming it's "wonderful" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Taur-Hamlets case.
“A court dealing with elections disqualified Lutfura Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal acts,” he reported.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — a criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
It also criticizes the unsuccessful “checks for the sake of glazing” of the electoral registration divisions of urban administrations.
Sir Erik stated: “The last sentence of the trial in Tower Hamlets was a signal of awakening.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of the parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and concealed spread of electoral fraud and the denial by some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Cat's bicycle analogy and other celebrities of Olympics in Rio
The Olympics 2016 in Rio this week went crazy on the French cyclist Polynes Ferran-Prevo, which proved to be impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Games isn't the only athlete who fights for gold this summer, which can be praised by her own famous double, at least reported in social networks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people on our screens at this time, F D.A. made a list of Olympics with more than a superficial similarity to the Hollywood stars.
A hunter and a wolf: a member of the U.S. ray team, Brady Allison, on the left, was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to the Keith double on a bicycle track, many online people have hurried to point out how a certain archaeologist could be a twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. archaeological team, Brady Ellison, was causing hurricane in Twitter, after the images of him appear to look terrifyingly like the Wolf's star with Wallstret.
And in fact, the archaeologist found out about socialist madness and admitted that he heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, maybe except vegetation on my face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly indicate even more this year: an amazing similarity between the British jumper Greg Roserford and the popular actor, Nile Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastka Aliya Mustafine, with her great eyes, is said to be an accurate copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estephan.
And in the South African swimming pool of Cameron Van der Burg, it has been compared to the star Khor Matthew Morrison for many years.
Turning to more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is a "spoiling version" of an actor "Natala"
Another long - lasting comparison was between the tennisist Rafael Nadar and José Harnett, who could be praised by similar heavy brows and lips.
A silver medalist from Russia, Julius Ethimov may not only be the same as the hot-skin and light hair as Anna Linn McCord actress, while Nathan Adrian of the U.S. team, according to fans, is like the “spoiling version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt”.
Surgeon women: Hope Solo star, on the left, and Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, have the same faces and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
By creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of this couple
One Twitter user recently went to the site to reveal her delight, that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
In fact, the U.S. football star and Dexter actress have incredibly similar shapes of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile close to the identical smile of the actress Laura Linnie, as well as the winning gold medal of the Gabby Douglas gymnast, which may be praised by its own beautiful broad smile, which resembles the smile of Gabriel Union.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying that the Chinese fisherman was dead as a pig.
Analysing Bayron McDonald's fourth seat at the Finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhayan on the female estaphite in a free 4x200 m style, he resented CBC audiences in the direct broadcast of Olympics
The Canadian broadcasting company CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "started like a womb" and "dead as a pig" during a swimming.
Commenter Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female estaphet 4x200 m free style.
You could have heard McDonald, who was drawn to the CBC commentator team to "small her in the color," said, "This 14-year-old Chinese woman has dropped her ball, baby."
Too thrilled, started like a wool, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Ay Yanghan, a Chinese sailor of 14 years of age, sailed the second phase of the estaphet for 1:57.79 by 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rak, allowing Canadians to break the distance from China.
Audiences across Canada responded quickly on the network after they were shocked by the tone and the expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC talk really just say that the 14-year-old fisherman from China's dead as a pig?"
This idiot did not understand that they were still in the air."
About Ay Yanghan, from China, in the finale of the female estapheta 4x200 m free style, they said, "It's a little 14-year-old Chinese girl who dropped a ball, baby."
Critica in Twitter immediately attacked Byron McDonald, and many urged him to be fired
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how unheard Bayron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradiz, wrote, "To himself #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a piece of racist. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was transmitting the CBC, apologized for his comment by McDonald, saying, "We're sorry that the commentary on swimming has come to the air."
It was a failed choice of words, we're sorry that it happened."
The SAF concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize to McDonald
CBC then copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
Teleseti too hastened to apologize and publish the application.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that they have been allowed to withdraw.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our audiences in a direct air and our subscribers in social networks.
Let us be clear, the comments of Byron have been regarded as a floating speech, not as an individual.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron really regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized for a direct air and tried to clarify his commentary, stating that he did not think his words interpreted as a personal attack.
'I'd like to use the moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the woman's estaphet,' he said at the CBC Olympic Games broadcast.
'I've talked about a swollen, not a personal address.'
'Of course, it didn't mean any disrespect, and I'm sorry.'
Principal buyer insulted a woman who unscrupulously exemplified the lower laundry in the middle of the store
The buyers didn't know where to take a look, when a woman came naked to illustrate the pants on the floor with shops in the middle of Pric.
What's worse, she's exemplified how she looked in them, pulled them down, and put them back on the floor.
She continued her search and eventually died four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place shop in Falkstone.
Magazine Principal of the Bouverie Place Trade Centre in Falkstone, where a woman used three-strong panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson's mother, who was at the store at the time, said that after the example of the underwear, a mysterious woman once again, "dressed and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Waiting in the middle of the commerce, she took a couple of panties off the rubber, took off her own cowards, and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a place to do it somewhere -- she just stood there, rubbish."
"They all got tired when she took off the panties again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three other couples before she finally decided that there was nothing she liked, dressed again, and left.
"It doesn't look like she was concerned about who was watching her, or what she thought about a man who would eventually buy the cowards she used."
Jenny Davidson, a 33-year-old, from Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone is going to take home some cowards that someone else already carried and they weren't embarrassed."
It happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I'm making the conclusion that staff seem to try to remove these items from the sales, after she left -- well, the better."
"I don't want to come home with a couple of women's cowards and find out what another woman weared and filmed them, and they weren't embarrassed."
The representative of Principal stated: “Primark knows of the incident that occurred at our store in Falkstone on Tuesday, 9 August”.
All the goods referred to were removed from the sale.
How to protect yourself from assaults with a gun using a raven-ga
The surrounding world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help you make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizarchi, a master of the Crabma Federation in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a close distance.
Whether it comes to you from the front or back, this video will show you how to beat the robber of his own weapons.
If it comes back, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so you can see the attacker and 'free the line'.
Then you press the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then there is a knee in the scent, and as the attacker blends away from the pain, you twist the gun from his hands, beat it in his face with a trunk, and go back and hold the guns upon him.
For an armed, approaching front, the way to perform is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and rotate it so that the thief cannot shoot.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of its arms before you step back and target it.
Does it sound tough?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get out of any robbery -- if you're not a master of the raven-ga -- is to pay your cash.
The traveller, Jan Wright, conducts his language in the direst places of Europe
The British traveller underwent his immune system and a vomiting reflex of a serious test, licking some of the most dirty and disgusting places in Europe.
The leader and author of the travel books, Jan Wright, 51, from Saffolk, spent the language of the euro bank, the perils of Cirk Pickadily, the wreck of the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before he licked each object, he used a luminome to show himself and us what it's going into.
But the experiment to be a film called "The Leadership of the Voyage-Lizun on the Inner Power" has yielded some amazing results.
The thought of licking a button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen shell.
Throughout the journey to Europe, Wright has talked to doctors and medical workers about increased bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, he had nothing to do with the lure of his mouth.
Wright became known for the tests of his intestine, traveling around the world, and eating strange and amazing things.
From public pearls on stations to the wagon button, it was undoubtedly his immune system.
In the film he filmed, he said, 'I was completely careless from my very childhood, and I put a lot of things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its test sketch demonstrated the value of a luminometer over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the hands that are just washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer value was more than 4,000 units, while the hands that he had just washed showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish Maternal Product Manufacturer Valio filmed a travel film entitled "Romanship of Traveller-Lizun on the Inner Power", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different locations, for example in the toilet
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I smelled in the bathroom."
There's nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna lick anything, because it's disgusting.
The Directorate of Voyage-Lizun on the Inner Force was removed with the Finnish Maternal Product Manufacturer Valio.
The company provided the Valio Gefilus Rita, which contains acidic bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestine bacteria and develop an immune system.
The Senior Vice President Valio for the bitches, juices and new categories of Niko Vuorenmaa said, 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended up with the idea of "keep calling Jan."
They claim that interest in the health of the intestine becomes a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the intestinal health and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and through this documentary film we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakalah, who was a film director, added, 'Let's say, 'I'd lose respect for Jan if he were to lick some of the things I asked, like the ugly Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Naturally, some of Jan's things were easier to lick, and some were rather tough.
I'm glad that some of these leases we've been able to film."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked acid bacteria exclusively to the good condition of the stomach and intestine, while 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes products containing added acidic bacteria.
The Huligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall municipality, before eviction
The Huligan family left her municipal home with damages of 50,000 pounds after being evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tania Skeldon and her partner, Sean Trebilkok, have been expelled from their real estate facility in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcedly evicted from the real estate, shocked housing cooperatives found the property in a state requiring repair.
The walls were left with glowing holes, the halves were opened, the garbage was sprayed on the floor, and the walls were splashed by graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McEvey, the settler at Cornwall Housing, said she feared not to save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that need to be weighed because this real estate object is likely to be known as not a very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad glory, and their name uses bad glory.
The couple had three children living in the real estate from time to time, and the police reported that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included fighting on the streets with baseball battles, intimidation of the inhabitants of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, disputes and slander.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was leased, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
A few rooms in a house that could be demolished found old trash.
Pool boards in a home where drugs were used to sell in the past were extracted
The neighbors say they saw the fights on the street and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week, after they had been granted a extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed with relief by neighbors who said that their lives had been turned into a whole hell.
One said, "They didn't bother."
We lived with them for 20 years, and that was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because we were so quiet here, we didn't get used to it!
Now that they finally left, it'll be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing neighbourhood team, said that the family could not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the home for 20 years, with the police, and were regularly summoned by the police
The mussels and old toys were scattered below the end of the municipal home
He added, 'It's a shame that the lessee was unable to accept any responsibility for her and her family's conduct, because eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the conduct was marginal, and their actions must have been horrible to her observants.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community have done bravely to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to neighbours and signal that social behaviour will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said that they were all a little over 20.

Resettlement workers will now have to remove the garbage chests that surround the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 g cannas, as well as weights, supplies and $1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he confessed to be guilty of possession of class B drugs for supply.
She stated that the money was paid for a graver for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were graffiti escaping across the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rental rules of the premises
Angela Crowe, a police officer from Devon and Cornwall, stated that this eviction had sent a clear warning to other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they can act without charges of the prosecutor and those who are hurt by such conduct,' she said.
Crime and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by the police of Devon and Cornwall, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
The tourists in Portugal were horrified when the low-flyed military aircraft almost touched the beach
In the town of Aveiro, Portugal, tourists frightened for their lives in a sunshine
The P-3C Orion Air Force of Portugal flew incredibly low
Air force reported that it had carried out a training flight but insisted that there was no security risk
This is a moment when frightened tourists start panicking, while the low - flying plane was sleeping over the overcrowded beach.
A military aircraft is seen in dramatic frames, flying almost at a distance from hunters on a strip from the sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
As soon as they became clear, the resters were concerned about the noise of the aircraft but were unable to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident took place last night near the city of Awayra in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernández, one of the few resters who published a video of a shocking flight in social networks, said, "He's been flying down at least twice, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed like he would break."
Nuno Arrozy added, "I've been practicing surf and I swear, it was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me."
The tourists on the beach of Awayru were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from a fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion aircraft had been flying to find fishing vessels off the coast and had to descend as low as it was the only way to verify them.
The pilot stated that the aircraft flew a little lower than it usually was due to the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby fire forests, but the air force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland part of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madayra.
Portugal ' s air force has made a statement today that the pilot has had to fly so low because of the circumstances of the thick fog and the ability of forest fires that have worsened the visibility of
The plane carried out a training flight and the pilot was assigned to detect fishing boats in the task
The HASSP system has been obligatory for a common drink for more than a year, but most of the cafés and restaurants in Petersburg have not yet been implemented.
Tests are becoming more active, and the business is threatening fines up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points System (HACCP, Russian version of HASSP) - risk analysis and critical checkpoints - is obligatory to use by producers and carriers of food, as well as by companies in the field of drinking in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (TC).
Rosbusodor business tests to meet these standards in Petersburg began in February 2015.
But in the meantime, the officials have fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see “Transfers”...).
The total failure to comply with the regulations would cost a factory of 600,000 roubles for the first breach and 1 million roubles for the second.
CASSP, a system that takes into account the risks and prevention of food, was developed in the United States in the 1960s.
It was then about the safety of food for astronauts.
The system is now being used in all food enterprises not only in the United States but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HASSP has been operating on TC territory.
The development and implementation of the business system was four years old (the demand for HASSME was introduced in the TC Technologies in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials recognize that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Regrettably, we had long been convinced that the norm was only for food production, not for the Restorators, -- explained the chapter of the Public Council of Helena Churches.
Now everyone's trying to get a lot of lost.
Expected resumption of charter flights to Turkey by the end of August to early September.
But they're not going to call the vicious demand, because their target audience, the families with the children, are already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Tourism Agencys sent a letter yesterday requesting the Government to permit charters now.
“For many Russian tourists, the question of the selection of quality and affordable marine recreation is inconsistent, since most facilities have been reserved before the end of September in the Krasnodar province and the Republic of Krym,” notes the authors of the letter and stress that the opening of charter transport in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for a Russian marine tourproduct.
As reported in the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Tourist Union (RST), if the aviation agencies of Russia and Turkey agree quickly, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding when charters are renewed until they are not available depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technological aircraft can fly in September, even August, if the tourists quickly build the programmes and agree with airlines on the right direction of the ships,” said Paul Romanians, the Deputy Director of Communications and the international projects of the North-West Regional Office of the RST.
He said that the possible resumption of charters was good news, but it would not affect the market force too much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - had already returned from recreation and were preparing for school or wassuing leave in other countries.
During the ambulance season, toures are mainly purchased by solitary travelers and couples.
The charter programs may count on those who have the opportunity to rest spontaneously," said Paul of the Romanians.
"In Turkey, there's a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it's going to give very budget proposals -- between 50 and 60,000 roubles for two tour because there are people who are focused on waiting for very cheap tour," says Valerie Rosenthal, Director-General of the Optio-Travel Tour.
In other cases the vouchers are definitely not worth counting - the main mass of travel is already planned.
Paul of Romania also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, the charters will also be demanded, but there is no need to wait.
"For Turkey the launch of charters now is the rehearsal of the next season," said Paul of the Romanians.
“The opening of charters to Turkey is a positive news for the next season”, agrees Valerie Rubtsov.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption of NFFLs from the legally established compensation payments within the limits of the approved rules relating to reparation for injury or other health damage.
The issuance of milk to workers employed in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the established standards is provided for in article 222 of the TC.
However, the rules and conditions of extradition are set out by the Ministry of Development Order of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
According to this document, free issuance of milk or other equivalent food products is done to employees during actual employment days with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
On the basis of the above-mentioned standards, the Russian FNS, in the present letter, concluded that, on the basis of paragraph 2, paragraph 3 of article 2, of the NCF, the income of the NDFL is exempted from the value of milk issued to employees in the days of actual employment with harmful working conditions in accordance with the Norms and Conditions approved by the Ministry of Education Order of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
The Moscow Gastrodbank remains without a CB license.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked a licence for banking operations from the Credit Organization of the GAZSTRABANK Equatorial Commercial Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, AO AKB “GASSTROYBANK” has implemented a high-quality credit policy related to the placement of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment on the demand of the oversight body and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank ' s assets have led to the credit organization ' s basis for the implementation of bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in doubtful transit operations.
The bank has appointed temporary administration to serve until the appointment of a competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the credit organization's executives are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
AKB GASSTROYBANK is a member of the Insurance Insurance System.
Recall that the insurance payments to bank investors, including individual entrepreneurs, under Federal Act No. 177-FZ “On Insurance of Contributions of Physical Persons in the Banks of the Russian Federation” are provided in the amount of 100 per cent of the fund balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles per investor.
The Insurance Agency shows that payments will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reporting data, 335 in the banking system of the RF have been held by the AO AKB assets of GASSTROYBANK as of 1 August 2016.
London schoolchildren, who joined IGIL, died in Syria
Kadisa Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join IGIL, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunji stated that her family had learned of her death in Racca, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is expected that it was killed by a Russian air strike in Racca, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
Sultan was 17 years old, and her family said that she died just when she planned to leave the war - torn country and return to England.
“It is only to hope that the only advantage of this is to be a premium and a will to others that these are the risks involved in going into the war zone to convince people to make the same choice,” said Akunji.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolchildren from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family said that she married IGIL a militant in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reed states that Clinton will remain loyal to Galand as a candidate for the High Judge in the event of election
The leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Harry Reed, said that he was convinced that a democratic candidate for President Hillari Clinton would be nominated by Judge Merrick Galland to the Supreme Court if he was elected as President.
The Republics of the Senate blocked Galland's claim, and as President Barak Obama nominated it in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, states that the next President will choose the person who will be able to replace the last judge of the Supreme Court, Antonine Scalia.
Rid stated at the conference on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Garland “with some degree of confidence”.
The representative of Rid later said that he did not speak directly to Clinton about whether she would move the Galland and simply constructed the assumptions.
He praised Galands and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to roll a boat with a new choice.
Galand is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeal for the District of Colombia.
Reid stated that the Republicans that block the nomination of the Galland are the "prizes" and the "helpers" of the Republican candidate for the Presidents of Donald Trump.
He said that the Trump was not suitable for the post.
Treats states that erotical calendars for 'women, as well as men'
Treats collaborates with photographer David Balmer to produce a calendar for 2017 inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of naked celebrities, they have the goal of finding the next generation of top models for their calendar for 2017 with naked muses.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of naked models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks that the calendar is too.
"We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classical naked figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," said Shaw in a press release declaring the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful artwork.
Models can present photos online or personally in public tapes in Los Angeles and New York.
Mosquitoes will be handed over on unfair Internet stores.
In Moscow, we're going to release a mark that tells us how to avoid being a victim of an Internet store.
This was reported in Rosbusozador, writes M24.
It is reported that agency specialists are preparing a mark that will help citizens to choose the Internet and identify possible fraudulent schemes correctly.
The concept of the brochure provides several sections.
These will be general information and the legislative framework, the rules of delivery of goods, the means of protecting their legitimate rights.
The annex will provide recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so forth”, reported in Rosmodenador.
The note is being elaborated to date.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the Rosbusodor website in Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and distribute to Moscow.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement calling the name of the second suspect in the organization of a diversification in Cruma.
Persons from Ukrainian and Russian nationals who have assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them are Mr. Evgenius Alexandrović and Zaktay Andrey Romanović.
"They all give an appreciative testimony," said the communication.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporoz district of Eugenius Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Kruma, confessed his guilt for interrogation.
The FAS is fined by Google with 438 million roubles.
The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has set up an administrative fine of 438 million roubles for the Google Corporation, referred to on the agency website.
"Gui for infringement of anti-monopoly legislation was $438 million.
We hope that the company will execute our decision and pay the fines soon,” said FAC Alexay Dánzko, Deputy Chief.
In the course of the FAS investigation, it found that Google is providing the Smartphone producers who are sold in Russia, the Google Play application store is only provided that other corporation applications are installed for the device.
These applications include a search engine to be placed on the main smartphone screen.
Thus, the Corporation is in violation of article 10, paragraph 1, of the FZ “On the Protection of Competition” (a predominant abuse).
We are confident that the enforcement of the requirement will provide an opportunity for developing competition in the Russian mobile software market, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Competition Protection Act should be respected by all companies whose products are shipped to the Russian Federation and by transnational corporations, including, among other things,” noted the Chief of the Russian Communications and Information Technology Management Office, Elena Zayva.
The statement suspects 16 Russian shops.
The New Book Network was fined for selling a book "50 days before my suicide."
The New Books shop network is fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," reports the City News Agency Mosqua.
The text of the book may be regarded as “provoking or motivating for suicide of children and adolescents” as reported in Rosbuzaar, without specifying the amount of a fine.
The Lennkini District Court confirmed a violation of the established requirements for the dissemination of information products to children and decided to impose a fine of 49 copies of the printed products arrested by the Rosbusodor Office.
The source in the New Book confirmed that this was the work of Steis Kramer.
In March this year, it was reported that the largest bookstore in Moscow was being checked for 50 days before my suicide.
In Moscow, Ernst's memory evening will be unknown.
In Moscow, the sculptor Ernst of unknown's memory evening, reports TASS.
The event will be held on 15 August at the Central Literature House.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say good-bye to the United States Unidentified in person.
It was therefore decided to set up this evening for those who wanted to remember it in their homeland”, stated in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It was noted that this was important for the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the unknown are invited to the evening, including the poet Evgenius Eutuschenko, artist Boris Messerererer, President of the GMIA, Pushkin Irena Antonov, director Marc Rosovski, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Moscow Culture Department, Alexander Kibowski, deputy mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechonic.
Previously, it was reported that Ernst's relatives were planning to carry out panicides on sculptor in New York, allegedly until 14 August.
The final consumer blamed: Who really buys the plates?
Lonely middle-year-old men like to blame.
And until you go down to scourge the section of the commentary with insults under the non-International Mussels, this allegation is derived from actual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the rebirth of plastic is due not to a boom of a generation of two thousand people who want to penetrate a new material object, but to nostalgia of medium-years.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album with a high probability rate are, according to data, between 45 and 54 years of age.
Moreover, those belonging to the 18-24 age group are least likely.
It is also not just an act of amateur gathering — it is emotionally important: older buyers have a slightly greater likelihood of holding their feelings (56% versus 53%) and enjoying loneliness (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking in the center of Soho's lively street, in a modest grey suit, and with a blunt gesture before stopping, folding my hands and saying something intriguing, "Yes, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and dirty -- hotels, cafes, paperchase shops have now filled up buildings once occupied by independent sellers -- a number of music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I'm close to different people in some of these shops and try to assess their age and emotional attitude by means of observation.
Glasgo Stewart, 55 years old, followed by Sister Ray, two young women, three middle-year-old men, to Reckless Records (accounting: eight males middle-years, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for a half-day meeting, and walks in shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, am I asking?
"I think so," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, shown above (he sent me by e-mail pictures, I didn't follow him home) go through the walls of his living room.
His reason for the acquisition of such a large number of albums and singles is partly due to his available income: he can now buy plates that he could not afford when they left and buy the items he sold when he was young and small.
"Many of the things I acquire are the end of the '60s, the beginning of the '70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy plates are probably introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much.
That's my shortage.
Wez, a 25-year-old who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets are in line with the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people who were influenced by the media, people who heard about their return and felt the duty to buy their old plates.
According to the conversations I had, people tended to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
The clients who have once sold their faults to buy CD-ROMs are now selling their CD-ROMs to buy their plastics," he says.
This could explain the boom among the renaissance figures to a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of plates?
It's enough to spend a couple of seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that plastic stores offer comfortable societies to people with similar views.
According to Uez, some older clients are, inter alia, offended by a cash-free system.
Some adolescences may be shocked by the digital world and prefer to move away from the acquaintances of acquaintances for plates, objects that spark memories of a quiet youth.
"I think it can sometimes be a filling of emptiness or possession of material things as a kind of relaxation," says Wez.
Since I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think many people have it too.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the stallage plates.
An ICM survey in April showed that nearly 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player that they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy wine do not have a player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have looked seriously puzzled by a panic stalk with the Bosanova congregators.
The "Trophy" aspect of renaissance is what Johnny observed, 42 years old, who works in Sounds of the Universe.
"Someone came in recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy Radiohead so that we can put it to ourselves," he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it's certainly happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a plastic player."
They're younger people, not old, they're a little less than twenty who just get to know it.
Fopp, who now took almost the entire floor of the wine, has a much more diverse audience when I'm coming.
There are couples in 70 years, tourists who photograph, teenage boys and middle-year women.
Although the atmosphere is less unforced than in the aforementioned shops — the last synth and sexy post Wild Beast, not jazz improvization, it is a pleasure to see diversity in its clients.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to find a painful psychological trauma standing 30 seconds next to someone.
Eléonora, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the different plates available for sale.
She's looking at goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make a lot of money, she says, so collecting plates isn't a good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device -- just, but beauty has been guilty -- it's..." -- it's embedded in the dreams of sighing, filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it is really unique.
My last stop is a shop, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of lovers: City fashioners.
While I'm making an illusion that I'm looking at jeans and jeans, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gathering around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of the Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, with Adel, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Flitwood Mac: a mixture of modern styles and classics, binding plates for any medium collection.
No one sees — perhaps because they are merely adornment, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "criminal fault."
But given that any attraction to these subjects could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients to the Soho deep for a while, almost nothing to complain about.
It's not surprising that the population layer, which is more likely than most people have more time and money than most people have, is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury objects such as guilt.
But while my findings show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho plastic stores, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of women collectors and amateur women who are guilty, which exist in reality, in plastic stores and on online platforms.
These people are probably working at school or office.
But they obviously do not spend the morning of Thursday walking through the shops on Bervik Street, spraying plastic plates and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader hanging over the shoulders of no suspected men of middle age.

The French Court rejects the proposal to rent shops in Jungli refugee camp
The French Court rejected the offer of the Kala authorities to demolish dozens of self-delivered shops and restaurants in Jungley camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the Kale authorities said that the State should be able to remove a total of 72 self-sustaining shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to jump or sell tea for 50 cents (40r) or simplest meals for a few euros in self-delivered restaurants.
Prefectural Kale said that these places should be dropped because they constitute a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they bear fire and sanitation risks.
The humanitarian teams told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, claiming that the free food offered by the pro-governmental association and other groups did not provide sufficient food for the growing number of foods in the camp.
They said that self - sacrificing shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lillah Court ruled that there was no legitimate basis for expelling 72 shops, but that the problems of Kalé prefectures “was fully understood”.
Judge Jean-Fransua Molla said that bachelors, cafés and restaurants played a much more role than just feeding people who "living in extremely confusing conditions."
He said that spaces provided calm points for the meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the Children's Coffee Book of Jungle at the camp, which does not work for the benefit and offers 200 lunches per day, English and French courses and advice on asylum for hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the child cafe.
The letter sent to Guardian said that his closure would be “would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom were not older than eight years old”.
Two charitable institutions, Refugee Assistance and L'Auberge des migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungley camp had grown and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in the summer.
The micro-rayon libraries invite young freemen to educational programmes.

Britain stays on silver in Regby-7 after the Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The British impressive series at Regby-7 was depressed at the final hurdle by Fiji's team at the final on Thursday night, when they were completely demolished at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class to own a ball, dissipation, evasion, play support, run lines and rude force to win the gold, their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was not too poor in the form of silver — the third one in Britain a day — and they could be proud of their efforts at the first Olympic tournament on Regby-7, where New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa were defeated on the road.
The sick beating of Boks, 7-5 in semi-final earlier on the same day, could have returned to negatively affect them in the final.
But in spite of anything, Fiji won the 15-person team in this form as much as possible.
This may be some consolation for Britain — but probably not — that at least one British will hang tomorrow on the neck of the gold medal: Chief Trainer, Fiji Ben Ryan, former Chief of England of Wimbledon.
This was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost only one thing here.
These blows will hurt, but progress is impressive.
Fiji started great for the fun to cut off British attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like pushing on a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau was diving in the corner.
Having four minutes for Jerry Tuway's hours, he added another tachdown on the right flank that had been implemented.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great attempt to intercept Lyon Nacarawa has kept the man on top of Leon Nacarau from killing the third, but this has only delayed Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremalwah made a tachdown in the right corner, and Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and there was still more minutes ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then threw himself through a few more stiff attempts at British interception and stormed into a line to get a glass.
The implementation resulted in a break between 29 and 0.
It looked like Fiji was born for the regby-7 game, while Britain still owns the craft.
That's a lot of it.
Great Britain made bulk replacements on half the game, and they sealed the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, that the first half standards were good until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for Britain by making a tachdown in the left corner to make the account 36-7, but the game was long over the South Sea islanders whose fans were singing, waving the flags and dancing on the tribunas.
It was not possible to be overjoyed by Fiji’s approach.
Mata William adorned a Fijian cake that was not needed to be decorated, another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians huddled, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely conquered.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in its semi-final, and Britain roamed South Africa in a strenuous semi-final, one of the attempts of everyone — the difference between the British reality.
Kyle Brown takes Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great work of legs, broke the line and hit the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept Marcus Watson, a brother of 15 on the side of England's team, Anthony, has won — and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the fight of the cancer coach.
There won't be more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy rises in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a further value in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the vagina, there were three voices in the boat, the echo of the coacher Robin Williams was always as long as they were trying for the second consecutive of the Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the Annas of British sports who had reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, eventually it was their 39th inconclusive speech, again unprecedented.
What we can see is that two brilliant athletes sliding over the surface with the elegantness of the lebedes do not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
With every gold, a battalion of ready hands that contribute to progressively growing victory, which are important, and no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who had been diagnosed as cancer 30 months ago did not know whether he would survive before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing.
I had urea bubble cancer, which is one of the things that they can operate, and they did it.
If they don't, he's going everywhere.
That could have been a pretty bad situation.
She's changing your vision for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Trio was fortunate that he could start treatment in early 2014 in intersezone, keeping the graph gap minimal if this could be the correct expression in such circumstances as these.
I needed a payment, so I had to get better.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital, and I walked about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said a few steps.
That's how it starts.
The grave itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after their victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who had spent the nervous morning talking a little bit more than usual in trying to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the Artillery Pool with the service in Afghanistan behind the shoulders, said, "I was a emotional collapse this week, maybe it's a little too much, but it means so much."
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much I and Helen worked, and Robin too.
It was fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost any race in five years.
This couple sets up a tense rhythm that their competitors never could match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when New Zealand and Denmark’s teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much stockpiles.
We were very much in the phase.
Helen's name: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process'.
Now it's very important not to get involved.
We had a good start, and at the same time we didn't try to do something amazing.
We weren't waiting for the fireworks today, but we were just waiting to be able to go out and get out and win this race, what we did.
A couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, at her own TV searcher for adventures by Steve Bekshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was a Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better," she said.
Government extended the destruction of sanctions products
The Government extended until the end of 2017 the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited by entry into Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions on the basis of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been repeated, and is now in force until 31 December 2017.
Russia is prohibited from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products have been banned.
The dismantling of food imported into the country by the embargo has been taking place in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were seized from the sale.
Hunting for a "prohibition"
The rains and storms are expected to occur in Moscow on Friday.
A atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, bringing rainfall and lowering air temperatures.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees of heat.
For example, on the Saturday night in Moscow there will be short rain, possible storms and wind breaks up to 15 m/s.
The day is expected to rain with storms and winds up to 12 to 17 m/s.
The rains with thunderstorms are also projected in the Orlovsky, Kurnish and Voronezi districts, and “Dni.ru”.
Next working week, rainfall is unlikely.
The WTO arbitrators panel found that Russian import duties for paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
Interests exceed the commitments made by Russia when entering WTO.
“This is the first time that WTO has decided against the RF,” says the report on the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their opinion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that the measures of Russia were “systemically” or “extracted”.
Russia, in turn, promised to adapt import duties to paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is described in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On 4 July it was reported that Kiev intended to welcome the World Trade Organization to Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is mentioned in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May Financial Times, the U.S. behaviour in resolving disputed issues in WTO undermines the organization ' s principles of discussion.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, European Union and other members of the WTO because of the refusal of Americans to approve for the second term by Judge Chan Sun Hwa of South Korea.
In this regard, Russia will not resort to WTO on the question of Western sanctions imposed against the FM.
WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It is now composed of 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The Presidential Administration has changed the leader.
President Vladimir Putin appointed the head of his own administration, Sergei Ivanova Anton Wyno.
Vladimir Putin has held a shift to the Presidential Administration and hopes that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the Government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Weino stated during the meeting that he considered the important anti-corruption work that had begun to be under the chairmanship of President Ivanov and promised to cooperate with the Government.
Earlier, it was reported that the experts considered the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the office of management to be transparent and understandable, and that the shift would not change in principle in the Kremlin administration.
They note that the leader who had been working with the President ' s administration for a long time has effectively established the work of the AP.
Instead, the Deputy Head of Administration, Anton Weyno, came to be a man who was well aware of the specificity of this work.
In Poland, it is accepted that fuel will not be purchased from Gasproma.
The State Polish Petroleum Gas Company PGNIG does not preclude that a few years later the supply of gas from the RF may become unattractive for it due to the reorientation of fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company, Bogosal Majetz.
His words are conveyed by the TASS.
"Perhaps we don't buy gas at all in Gasproma," we're going to diversify our supply.
Within the next four years, the main deliveries for us will be East, CNG-terminals and Norway's raw materials,” said Majetz.
Gasprom is currently dominant in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier had placed almost 5.3 billion cubic metres of gas in the first half of 2016, which was 30 per cent higher than the 2015 level.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG procurement grew to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent earlier.
Remember, on 22 July, the Polish Antimonopoly Authority did not agree on the establishment of a joint Gasproma company and its European partners in the construction of the gas pipeline “North Flow-2”.
This month earlier, Poland left the Gasproma request for 11 billion cubic metres of gas on "North Flow-2".
This was said by the Vice-President of the Holding Government, Alexander Medvedev.
Auction on the capacity of the "North Flow-2" will be held in 2017 and auction is planned on its stack in the autumn of 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gasprom had not yet planned to act on the Polish side ' s intentions to give up long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, and the Vice-President of the Government of Alexander Medvedev stated.
He recalled that during the first quarter of this year, the Polish had only increased by 42 per cent the RF gas purchase.
Gasproma added that the fact that a Polish PGNIG application had been filed with the Stockholm Arbitration Court did not yet mean the termination of negotiations.
Previously, the Polish company had appealed to the judiciary to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that Petre Naimski, Commissioner of the Polish Government for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, reported that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gasprom for the supply of gas.
Polish contract with Gasprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish Commissioner for Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, stated that his country could six years later abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east.
He said that Warsaw was planning to build a new liquefied natural gas supply terminal, which would connect the country to the Norwegian Shelf.
“North flux-2” provides for the construction of two sea gas pipelines with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Krum.
This was reported by Alexander Hug, Ukrainian First Accomplishment of the SMM.
“I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, responding to the related question of journalists, transmits the RIA News.
According to the OSCE, the situation at the border of Ukraine and Crime is calm and there are no security incidents.
Observers monitored three crossings across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
There was a video of an airplane landing at Ufa at Yak 42, which flew outside the airstrip 400 m and collapsed on the left wing.
The video published a 360 television station.
The PPP took place at 4.30 by Moscow time.
Cras Avia's flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place that was not affected.
The aircraft itself were transported in a parking lot.
Ufa airport works in normal mode.
The FMR ' s Fellow Inquiry in Transport has clarified the reason for the rigid landing of the liner aircraft.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The United Nations Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in the rebel areas of the Syrian town of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict denied the use of chlorine, but the UN Special Envoy for Syria, Stephan de Mistura, considered that the case was indisputable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian negotiations, to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists have initiated investigations into reports of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on toxic gas terrorists, allegedly chlorine, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition stated that in the area where the Russian military helicopter had been shot down the previous day, the aviation dropped the poisoning bombs, but in Moscow these charges were described as being thrown down.
Subsequently, the Russian Ministry of Defence accused the Opposition Group of Harakat Nur Al-Din Az Zinki.
Soon it was known that there were two toxic bombs.
This was confirmed by BBC by one of the victims.
"Some minutes later I felt the smell of gas, the beginning of the burning of my eyes, the difficulty in breathing," quotes the introduction of the eyewitness.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poisoning gas is confirmed by experts, action will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, stated to journalists: “The evidence that this has actually happened is a lot.”
The inadmissibility of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Although all parties to the Syrian conflict denied the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the “intentional opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the daily shooting of its areas and by terrorists inhibiting the departure of the inhabitants.
According to Reuters, the United Nations expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current three-hour shadow regime in the organizations is considered “not sufficient to help nearly 2 million civilians trapped.”
Staffan de Mistura Humanitarian Adviser Jan Egelann stated that a 48-hour ceasefire would be required for the delivery of assistance and evacuation to the city from there.
“We have to send volume cargo from a convoy of trucks in the area where roads are practically destroyed and those remaining are mined,” said Mr. Egelann. “But the Russian delegation has confirmed its willingness to sit with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between the representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
As Russia opened the "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, the second largest Syrian city, Russia, on 11 August, announced the establishment of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take place daily from Thursday.
The establishment of “humanitarian windows” is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Minoborna RF was taken against the backdrop of increasing international pressure on Moscow, requiring the reverse of the military operation and facilitating the resumption of the negotiating process.
Four people died as a result of a series of explosions on the couriers in Thailand.
Immediately a few explosions in southern Thailand broke out on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 wounded.
The episentre of the explosion was the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, four nationals, not Russians.
The responsibility for the incident has not yet been taken by any of the terrorist factions, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs has hurried to state that the Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of the organization of the explosions.
Preliminary data from the local police show that the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they have been directed against the military leader of the country.
Attacks took place on popular tourist resorts, including the Patong beach in the Phouketa region and the towns of Hua-Hin, Tang and Surat Tani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2 per cent (2012) to 2.8 per cent (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, 14 million people had already visited the country, an increase of 1.5 million over 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, and Colonel Chrisan Patanacharoen of the Police reported.
As early as it was, he added, but in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, “they are certain that they are not related to international extremist groups”.
It's too early to make conclusions,' said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact these are local diversifications, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
Explosions took place on the birthday of Queen Sikrit of Thailand.
The Thai junta considers the protection of monarchy to be one of its main priorities, so an incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to the allegations by the General of the Police of Sithhika Srizopacharoenrat, the bombs were bombed remotely with the difference half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on lively streets filled with lunches by tourists in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four deaths was a Thai girl who traded street food.
The persons of the remaining victims are still unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Thai Police, there are four German citizens, three Dutch subjects, two Italian nationals and Austrian nationals.
No Russians among the victims of the explosions, reported the Rosturism press service.
Local experts also link explosions with the referendum of 7 August, where 61.4 per cent of the population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by the Constitutional Commission appointed by the military junta.
The voters had to determine whether they supported a system in which the upper House of Parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role to play in the election of the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that a military coup in Thailand took place on 22 May 2014 under the leadership of the commander of the Army of Pryta Chan-Och.
He said that the army had stirred up an ongoing political crisis and no progress in the negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The military established the National Peace and Order Council, introduced curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper House of Parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai Government, chaired by Prime Jinglak Chinavat in January 2014, announced the imposition of a state of emergency in Bangkok and the capital provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the centre of Bangkok, a Monument of Victory, where one of the major protests was held, two explosions, resulting in 28 casualties, five of which were in critical condition.
Explosions made unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities strengthened security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In Sukh Log, conditions began to be developed.
As U.S. became known, the Government is invited to harmonize the draft auction on the gold mining of Sukha Log with two key limitations.
It is proposed to prevent auction from a company where 25 per cent or more belong to foreigners and those whose capital would not be at least 25 per cent of the State party.
The industry does not expect the Government to rewrite the conditions, noting that many players are not at risk of taking a difficult and expensive project.
The auction may be announced in August, and it will be held in October.
Minorities have introduced the Government's draft order and auction for the largest undeveloped gold mining site in Russia, Sukha Log (Irkuts region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), and have presented two sources of “Unci” that are familiar with the situation.
The draft was introduced on Wednesday evening, clarifying one of them.
In the Minnature, the U.S. confirmed that the project had been introduced to the Government.
A spokesperson for the non-driven vice-premiere Alexander Chloponn said "U" that the office office had not yet received the project.
“The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the government order has been issued, and given the time limit for the gathering of applications for potential participants (at least 45 days) the tender may take place in October”, they say to the Minnature.
According to the U.S., the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, as set out in the version to be agreed upon by ministries and FOIWA in July (the U.S.).
The first is the existence of at least 25 per cent of the State party in the capital.
The second is the refusal of access to auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on investments in strategic societies.
According to the two draft articles of the FZ, as already stated on 2 August, the auction may prevent a company whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of the share and above) are not tax residents of the RF or have dual nationality.
The Government has the right to impose such restrictions, as Sukhah Log refers to the bars of federal value (more than 50 tons of gold reserves).
In the Minnature, it was confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the Government ordered.
The auction member ' s auction capital requirement was put forward by the Irkutsk region, said in December 2015 "U" to Minnature, and confirmed later by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Minnature by his predecessor, Sergei Eroschenko, “the investment agreement with Rosteh”.
Those who lobbyed the restrictions on the permit of aliens, the U.S. interlocutors do not specify.
"But that's in the spirit of time, not to control the largest gold deposit in Russia in the background of Western sanctions," reasons the U.S. interviewer familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The Head of the Minnature, Sergei Donski, stated on August 1, that foreigners “can go to a consortium” if the claimants attracted them “as financial structures, technology partners”.
The U.S. interlocutors find it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The largest gold mining consortium of the RAO Polus, under the control of the son of Sukha Log in the industry, is considered the consortium of the largest gold mining industry of the RAO “Polus”, under the control of the son of Sulayman Kerimov Said, and “Rosteha”.
In July, partners created SP "SL Gold", where Polus had 51% of its share, RT-GP was 49%.
In Rostehe, they refused comments, in Polus they stated "U", that "unbelievably, they are interested in this asset" and have all the competencies and resources they need for its development.
“But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be taken after the declaration of conditions”, added to the “Pollus”.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision for the Government of the RF, the U.S. sources said.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotke, said that they could participate in the development of the Sukhogo Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to the data, did not interest asset.
The Head of the Union of Gold Industries of the RF, Sergei Kashub, estimated the United Nations investment in Sukha Log in December 2015 at $2.5 to 4 billion.
Most potential applicants are not only intimidating investments, but also in complex ores: a serious development of stockpiles and technology is needed, explaining U.S. interlocutors in the industry.
In the pension market, the largest M&A deal - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" started the process of uniting four undercontrol PNPs.
As a result, the NPF will be created on the basis of the Gasfond Pension Stocks, with an accumulation of about 373 billion roubles.
The launch of the procedure for the consolidation of four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofund, Heritage and Gasfond Pencional accumulation - yesterday reported to the owner 100 per cent of the OEA funds “KIT Finance Pension Administrator”.
“Reorganization is carried out in agreement with the CB, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the treaties in force”, says the company's report.
The association is based on the Gasfond Pension Stocks.
As the genitor of this NPF notes, Oleg Bialoshitsky, the pooling of funds allows for several tasks: expanding geography of the presence, concentrating resources for development, lowering costs, replication of the best practices of each fund and optimizing corporate governance.
He said that the indicative deadline for the completion of consolidation was the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the NPF association, Gasfond Pennsylvania accumulations will become the largest player in the JPU market.
As of 31 March, the total pension accumulations of the combined funds exceeded RU 373 billion.
According to the accounts on the Funds website, the beneficiaries of their owner, “CIT Finance Pension Administrator”, are currently Anatolia Gavrilenko (through under the control of the GSOs, 65 per cent) and NPF “Gazfond” (35 per cent).
However, the group itself started competitors much later.
For example, under the control of the O1 NPF, the "Building" group swallowed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the Uralsib and the Russian Standard funds.
“Commoning into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to address structural tasks”, notes Nicolas Sidorov, NPF gentor.
Active work on the consolidation of funds has also taken place in the Safmar pension team, the European, Education and Science, and the Regionfond, by the NPF “Safmar” until the end of the year.
In 2017, the NPF will be joined by “Documentation”.
“Integration of funds will enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditure”, noted in the Safmar pension team.
Several reasons may be the result of the stalling in the association of funds with which the “Finance Pension Administrator” was awarded by the experts.
Until recently, NPF was unable to purchase more than 40 per cent of the volume of infrastructure bonds to which the group was actively deployed.
After the CB order was amended in March this year for a number of emitters meeting the requirements of the regulator, such restrictions are no longer available.
If necessary, the entire output can buy one large player," says the director of the ACRA Financial Institutions rating group Yury Nogin.
Several NPF leaders from top-15 on assets have another possible pausa cause referred to the division of influence and, as a result, staffing assignments in a single fund to be agreed upon by the owners of the group.
Yesterday Anatolia Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
The U.S.P.P.P.P.D. has not answered either.
While consolidating funds is a labour-intensive and cost-effective exercise, this decision will be justified for a long distance.
According to Sergei Okolesnov, the Consulting Company ' s genitor of the Consulting Company, the Gasfond Pencional accumulations are less than the outflows, accession will enable stabilization of the base of other group funds.
The more successful experience of NPF “KIT Finance” and “Promagrofund” in the construction of retail sales of PKS, as well as the use of more modern PBS.
The requirements of the CBS for PNP processes and personnel are constantly growing, so duplicate infrastructure at four funds with a single investment is not appropriate, considers the Director of Corporate RA Expert Paul Mitrofon.
“The efficiency of reducing duplicate functions will unambiguously cut off the possible costs of uniting,” observes Mr. Mitrofan.
The cost of uniting the four funds of Sergei Okolesnov is estimated at RU 30 to 50 million.
“The cost of four such funds is about 400 million roubles per year, while consolidating in the medium term the budget is halved”, Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
The Russian procat had the finest dysneev movie "Pet and His Dragon."
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the clever dragon, the fascinating history and the canter-style songs are enough to re-enter old-fashioned magic.
A frightened child picked up a dragon who became a human baby and a gentle baby-sitter and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy of tales, plays his bait with him and sleeps in a hug.
Six years later, he grew up and had a superfluous band, no longer distinguished from another deliberate forest-sorvant, Maugli.
In this form, Peta finds a red-headed herd of Grace (Brace Dallas Howard) while Gavin's Brigade (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively hanging the forest.
Now she'll have to not only believe in a dragon but also help him save.
Pete is being accelerated by being a human being in the midst of Idilli Americans who carry cowboy shirts, the moral code in the heart and smile more blindly than any advertising.
No character looks or acts too terrible to really hate him or to fear him.
Even Gavin, a hunter for an untypical resident of his own forests, is far from being corrected.
The huge fuzzy dragon, too, was not scary, with the good face of the bouldog, the airliner swings of the wing, and the ability to become invisible.
Dragon's funny torn, murmuring, even grunting, and, fortunately, not saying, but all the time he wants to be smoothed, it's profitably different from all the famous cinematographic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and his manner of staying ensured such a high degree of emotional involvement that at the most tense moments, it was beginning to cry desperately in three rugs not only for small spectacles but also for adults.
Impressively good and young Oax Figli as Pete, breaking between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously publishes a canonic grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lourie succeed in taking a fantasticly cute beam of the forgotten dysneev film of Dragon Pete from his nose to the end of his tail, and making it the most emotional film of this summer?
Not except a miracle helped.
In his painting, Louri from the original actually took only two things: the orphan of Pete and the dragon.
There's music rooms and a lot of weird jokes left behind.
In this good story, we read the features from Bembie, Innoplanetite and many other nice hearts of child paintings.
Disney Studio continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality belts of the twenty-first century.
Of course, Pete and Dragon aren't as incredibly beautiful as the same jungle Book, and there's no skillful evil that Kate Blanchet's had as a stepmother in the new Zolshka.
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and goodness in the best dense traditions.
By the way, the keys from Disney Director Loury's magic castle will get again for the artistic pian's story.
Tandem David Loury and scripter Toby Helbroux, working at Pete and His Dragon, entered a new ambitious project on a non-adult boy on the same name James Barry's story.
Journalist RBC Alexander Sokolova will present a new charge
The lawyers of journalist RBC Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing an extremist structure, stated that the Prosecutor ' s Office had found faults in their defendant ' s case.
We learned from the investigators literally yesterday that the Public Prosecutor's Office made this submission.
We have been scheduled to participate in a judicial meeting on the limitation of the knowledge of criminal proceedings, but the meeting has not been held, and the investigators have informed us of the submission made by the Public Prosecutor's Office,” says the RBC attorney Olgi Dince.
She explained that the Prosecutor ' s Office had indicated to the investigators that the qualifications of the case and the material collected were not in conformity with the circumstances.
The investigators will now have to remove the gaps in the evidence base and bring Alexander Sokolo's new accusation.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or the same article will remain, but with other arguments and new evidence, she shall clarify.
Alexander Sokoval was arrested on 29 July 2015, as reported by the U.S.A.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded journalist RBC from the accusation the wording of “restraining the political situation towards instability” and “reflecting power illegally”.
ALEKSONDR ZILBERT lived the Olympic in the Olympic village, inspected the Russian assembly house, lunched in the local dining room, and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
I don't think life here dies for a second.
Even at night.
The last startups sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need an hour and a half to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, villages and evictions are being settled and evictions without stopping, as some athletes complete their statements and leave Brazil, and some of them, on the other hand, only arrive here.
At 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are drawn to a temporary tent.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational domestic issues, the head of the Olympic delegation of the Russian Olympic team, Igor Kazikov.
It's a problem with hot water, I'm sorry, with unitas.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the clinders came, but they only hit some substance on the floor, and everybody.
The floors are, you see, some kind of innovation.
Mol, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors are common laminates!
Anyway, the clinginging company has changed, and now it's all right.
The Olympics village is South Bouto, a bedroom area fenced on the one hand by mountains, on the other, an inspiring ivory, places filled with water.
And for reliability, there is still a two-metre iron fence all over the perimeter along which the machines are walking along.
In total, up to 17,000 people may be placed in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-story buildings, the huge Russian flag hangs, this house is completely given under our prefabricated.
Looking at a small foye at the entrance, you can immediately identify the problems that may be the most pressing for the domestic team.
Two advertisements hang on the record: "Please, don't throw paper into the toilet!" and from the hand, "I'll give you the badges.
It's the one who's drowning in the tracts.
Their brightening contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: “The infectious disease marker for the travellers in Rio de Janeiro”, “First aid in drowning, infectious bodies in breathing paths, loss of consciousness - stages of heart and light reaction”, “First aid with burns, heat strike, breaks and bleedings”.
It's a very encouraging text inside.
For example: “Infections are accompanied by fever and subsequent cures.
However, not everyone will have a favourable outcome.
Of course, there is a medical centre in the assembly of Russia that is ready at any time to provide qualified assistance to the household, including relaxing and sporting massage.
In contrast, our delegation's own headquarters.
Around the door, an inspiring poster, "Not seeing anything, we'll win."
And, of course, verses:
All the arguments are absolute bullshit!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let's be less than us, the sweeter taste of victory, Russia won't retreat, it won't break!
And for an even greater show of spirit, the announcement, "Dear Brothers and Sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Russi Cyril’s spiritual care for the Olympic assembly of Russia is being carried out by the protoire Andrew Vladimirovic Alexeyev.
You can order moleb and other needs on the phone...
In general, there is a centre of meditation and religious rituals for all denominations in the village.
And the Russians, it turns out, in their privileged position, they have their own temporal.
Because of the loading of elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled upon the bodies upon which he lay.
Apparently, they were sleeping fellow workers of the new Clining Company.
I believe at any time they're willing to throw themselves at the washing of the innovative sexes, they've decided to have a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was awaiting a meeting with a longstanding acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, a coacher of our battists, who brought them to the Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his tutor, a European champion of Jana Paul’s, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
We're living in two beds, of course, almost prizes, but it's not critical.
Sanusele is on four, but it's spacious.
Sock, of course, ridiculous, from tissues, trust doesn't, but things can be put in.
"No, you're kidding, they've got tea!"
It is known as at least because it is a space of 2,700 m and is ready to accept 5,000 visitors at the same time.
It's a total of 60,000 servings per day at the top of the day.
The menu options are: "The Best of Brazil," "The World Cookies", "Azia dishes" and "Pitz, Makaron articles".
The last version, as I saw, is very popular with our volleyballs.
Well, let's say I didn't find any soup in any of the gigantic restaurant units.
What kind of soup?
I'm glad I took Chinese with me, weird.
And a teapot.
But in general, if you understand, we've got even worse food on the cortex.
Anything can be chosen here, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I've personally chosen a crack for a couple and a tomato sauce.
A plate with its name in three languages is English, French and Portuguese, as well as the food value and allergens.
I'm sure to admit it was edible.
I don't know why this turn is always in the local McDonald's.
Suffocated, relaxed, you could say "foot" athletes on the way out of the restaurant are waiting for our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're fascinating a victorin that wins the T-shirt.
They're provoking, you can say!
In order to receive a gift, at least eight of the ten questions need to be answered correctly.
- A girl from WADA attacked me.
But I didn't.
I mean, I'm in a patriotic turmoil, of course.
The situation has already worsened on the second question, "If I received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping-control point?"
I stopped at option B, "No, I have one hour."
I lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that WADA of weaknesses don't have to wait.
Anyway, we need to show up right away.
Well, at the seventh stage of Victoria, my situation became very critical.
I thought for some reason that if I found it difficult to observe a balanced diet because of my density schedule (and I am, by the way, hard!), I could use bioappropriations to get supplementary nutrients to increase my productivity.
And no, they don't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in a way that is not categorically prohibited, but strongly, in a number of proposals, rejects.
WADA's playing it unfairly!
How's it going, Russia?
There's nowhere behind Ethimov, Ishinbaeva, and all of our uncovered team.
That's why I concentrated and won the unfortunate T-shirt.
Know ours, as it is said!
In my victorious mood, I found myself in the fitness centre around the neighborhood.
Get involved in counting the trainers.
He hit 250.
Surprisingly, no Russian athlete was found in this accumulated race tracks.
But maybe it's right?
Let him train who doesn't know how to play!
And in a nearby polyclinic, one of our guys was sitting there.
In line for the occupant.
Don't worry, don't shoot.
In a polyclinic, however, like all over the village, anywhere in the ivy, is hanging the condom-extraordination apparatus.
Therein is an encouraging call, "Finish with the condo."
Further, the iron that resembles the door castle and the condom made from the natural latex of the Amazon is ready to get out of the apparatus.
I took myself alone, to remember.
The athletes won't leave, they took 450,000.
It is the Olympic village that has a whole place of entertainment for the holiday and celebrity.
A knowledge plate reminds us that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million per day in various ways on athletes.
The center is flooded with video games, billard tables and tennis tables, football and Hokkey and some strange devices like video trainers.
I'm interested in a comrade in the form of a Ukrainian collection, who actively uses a wild toy.
Of course, I could just say that I don't want to talk to a man in the form of a prefabricated Russia, and that's all.
Here, by the way, there's a strange situation in the eyes of the boys in the yellow blue.
It's the most playable, it's coming out.
It takes at least three hours to walk through the entire village by looking at each corner of it.
But if you do not go to the electric cars, you will also be able to open the home of a Canadian elbow collector at the entrance and a tank with refurbishing bathroom, and a ticket office, and laundry, and cleaning, and grocery, and flower shops, and a bench with daily merchandise, and a mail with unique marks (only you can still wait for the Chinese philatelists) and a bank, and an adventure office, and a photoscock.
And late in the evening, you're going to sit at the olive tree that's mocked with colorful tapes to remember the friends and relatives of athletes who have left the world.
And you're going to be under an accompaniment of a machine that's rubbishly spraying fluid to kill insects, thinking about an eternal one.
It's about the Olympic movement.
This village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching Australians almost punished by the American Dream Team, the real chillers went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Deriglaza won the gold in the rapier on the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first.
Maybe I'm even the only mosquito who's seen how it happened, not counting the people, of course, who was watching the carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand it.
Imagine the Deaf Night of Moscow.
The neighbors downstairs, as always by the hour of the night, wake up and start violently, but loudly shouting at each other.
And it's threatening to move furniture.
In the kitchen, there's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
There's nothing in the TV schedule, so it's just holding the "Match" control channels, "First" and in any case "Russia" -- although it's almost meaningless.
"Russia" is a family of repeats, the whole sport is something on record.
There's a live broadcast.
Hope, of course, on "Match" -- the entire evening the young man yelled in news releases first about the great semifinal of Deriglaze -- Shanaev, then about the coming battle for gold.
It would be logical to show it.
But instead, basketball, U.S.-- Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about that.
Australians were equal, the first half won.
They put them in the place of the Americans who were filthy of their own greatness.
As a result, it has been lost, but the basketball Olympic tournament is now said to be no longer the same.
It's all good, but it's about to fight Dee Frances, and it's not changing on the screen.
In a light panic, I start writing channels.
It feels like it's gonna be a second time.
Okay, let's go deep into the cables.
There's no feuding on any of the thematic "Mothers".
Oh, I feel that the fight is about to start.
The texts and tweets of some sports sites don't suit me.
The drift surf gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
The “First” website shows that a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that are taking place at that time is being conducted.
I'm calling for the fencing, I'm getting one for gold.
Derigose's a great counterattack, going ahead in the glasses, and obviously it's starting to take a while.
The Italian woman plays almost a whole break.
We're one point ahead, just over two seconds.
De Franchiska is thrown at Derigazu, and retreats, time ends, Italian takes a shot.
Victory!
A few seconds later, the Olympic Massenger on the phone reports a fourth gold medal.
It turns out I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
The foolish, the faithful, the enthusiastic.
The spiritual administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses the use of Russian in mosques.
Yesterday, the prison captivity obliged his imams to carry out Friday sermons only in Tatar to make young Tatars learn their mother tongue.
It is stated in the administration that this “in which case it does not violate” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazani finds that Tatars do not understand up to 60 per cent of the members, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
Imamas fear that their preaching in Tatar will not reach the whole audience.
Yesterday, the Tatarstan prisoner unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the Republic only in Tatar.
According to Tatarstan muft, Camille Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to “learn their own language”.
"For those who say "gravy," in each big mosque, we intend to organize Tatar language classes completely free," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today, in all the mosques of the preaching, "should be in Tatar."
He recalled that DUM Tatarstan was publishing the magazine "Shura" with typical Tatar sermons.
Imam, who doesn't say Tatarsky enough, "can prepare for them thoroughly."
The Tatarstan DOU brings together more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the muftia, in the area of Friday, the preaching work is conducted exclusively in Tatar.
At the same time, mostly Russian was used in a number of mosques in Kazani.
In particular, according to the muftium, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, the Zakaban and the Enniler.
However, Mr. Mohamethschin stressed that the leadership aims to ensure that all students have the two national languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"No harm can be inflicted on non-tatar Muslims," said Mr. Mohamethschin, "the sermon itself is not a mandatory, essential part of the Nazareth."
At the same time, the mosque itself will continue to read in Arabic, with lectures and lessons retained in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Mohammetchin said "I" that there was no serious threat of pushing the Tatar language out of the mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, he has reportedly not been used in the preaching work in the Republic.
The DPKO decision was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The chief of the UKT Rinate Zakirov, said, "I," "Macheti is an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had gone from this area.
He noted that the practice of preaching in the Tatar language was “the desire of the imams themselves”, but in the FTC caucus “decided it to be correct”.
The U.S. Imamas interviewed who preached in Russian are willing to implement the decision of the DMA, but they believe that there will be difficulties in understanding the clergy.
The Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many don't understand the language.
They will, of course, be trembling.
"It will be necessary to rebuild," he says to the Burnaev Mosque of Farhat Mavletdinov.
He said that even many Tatars are nearer to Russian, because “Russian and in schools and in children's schools, on radio, everywhere.”
However, he believes that the mosques will be able to continue the Russian lessons and lectures held in other days.
We rely on Allah.
God will show you the way out of this situation.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
These are Uzbeks, Tajikis, and Azerbaijanis.
There are many foreign students visiting us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've moved into Russian for four years," he says to them.
He believes that, in Tatar, the preaching language will “to reach a narrower circle and will not reach the whole audience.”
But we will be subject to the decision of the captive.
Just the outcome of the sermons is different.
But time will show.
"I'm, for example, gonna be easier because the Tatar language is my mother," Gabdulla Galiollin concluded.
The former Director of FSIN was brought to court.
The Moscow Prosecutor ' s Office approved the indictment on the DSG investigation criminal case of theft of budgets allocated to the Russian FSIN.
Alexander Reimer and his deputy will be brought before the court by the ex-charge of the prison office, which has damaged more than 2.7 billion roubles.
The capital prosecutor ' s office sent a criminal case to the Zamoskwark Rajsk, concerning the former Director of the FSIN of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former Deputy Nikola Krivolapov, as well as the Director of the Information Technology and Liaison Centre of the Federal Prison Service (FGUP CITOS), Victor Defined.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in crime, they are accused of the JCR GSM on Moscow at 3 p.m. 285 (abuse of official powers that have had serious consequences), at 4 p.m. 159 of the Criminal Code (motivation of the official position of the organized group, to a particularly large extent).
In addition, Crivolapas are accused at 1 p. 222 p.m. of the Criminal Code (unlawful acquisition and storage of munitions).
According to the UKR, in 2010-2012 these persons fraudulently abducted from the State treasury budgets allocated by FSIN to provide the departments with electronic monitoring systems for sub-controllers, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budget money, the Panel has developed a scheme whereby the CITOS FGUP, which has been contracted by the relevant government contracts, has produced technical means of control and oversight, including “electronic bracelets”, and has been implemented at prices overstated several times.
Although the CITOS FGUP did not have production equipment, buildings, buildings for the construction of production capacity to create a completed "electronic bracelet" cycle, five State contracts of more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Russian FSIN.
As a result, more than 2 billion roubles were found in the Samaria branch account, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
As a result, more than 140 million rubbish cash was personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office from a member whose criminal proceedings were committed to separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the mahinacials, found an unknown origin of the cartridge to the prize gun, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, FSIN has filed a claim for compensation of RU 2.7 billion for damages to the accused.
Hakan Shukur's Footballist is suspected of being involved in the rout.
The Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a former football player and then a member of the Hakan Shukur Parliament and searched two homes of his family.
The Star of Turkish football in the 1990s, the beginning of the 2000s, the attacker Hakan Shukur, is searched by the authorities for an attempt at a coup d ' état last month.
Forvard, who graduated from a sporting career in 2008, is accused of being a “armed terrorist group”.
This is the movement of Hismet, a society associated with a well-known Turkish religious actor and the opposition of Fethulah Gülen.
It is his President, Erdogan, who is the organizer of an attempt to engage in a military coup d ' état, which took place on 15 July.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, and the Turkish authorities require his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukura has been issued today, and the police have already conducted searches in two homes belonging to the former football family.
According to the investigation report, his father also joined Fetchullach Gülene, in addition to Hakan Shukur.
However, neither the former football player nor his loved ones were found there.
Now he and his family live in the United States.
In the home, Hakan Shukur, a soccer, defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and advocated the assembly country.
He spent most of his career at Galatasari.
The list of overseas clubs includes Italian Torino, Inter and Palermo, as well as the English Blackburn.
True, he didn't have more than one season in any of them.
Khakan Shukur still remains the most effective target of Turkey's assembly, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 dead ball.

They are accused of contributing to the military coup and ties with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
In view of the gravity of the charges, the media may wait long prison sentences, from 10 years to several life imprisonments.
Histor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of film theaters only for domestic films.
"I'd have created a network of movie theaters solely for Russian movies, which cost two or three times as much as foreign films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovski observes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for viewers with large Hollywood tapes.
We have more than 100 paintings per year in the country, of which an average of 20 to 25 tapes reach the screens.
"And even it's very hard for them to compete with "Transformers" and "Iron Man" in which huge budgets are loaded," said the film director.
Remember, on 1 July, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum, Tavrida, began to be held in Curma.
Participants include artistic professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian activities from all Russia and a number of countries in the Middle and Far East.

The new gene contractor of the St. Petersburg Stadium, who is to accept the 2017 Confederation Cup and the 2018 World Championship Championship on football, the Metrody promises to be rented by 26 December, reports the Newsty Ria, with reference to the head of the Council of the Federation's Interim Peace Cup Championship for Tülpanov.
"Today, we with the Russian Sport Minister Vitalym Mutoko visited the building, and we had a Master's Director, Vadim Alexandrovs.
He said he'd give up the stadium by December 26th.
It's a serious Petherburg company, and it never breaks the deadline.
"We and Vitaly Mutoko are happy to see and hear," quotes the interviewer's agency.
Beginning in St. Petersburg, Vital Mutoko had arrived in order to inspect the location of future major competitions.
Mr. Tulipov also noted that the Saufeda commission, which he chaired, would continue to monitor the construction of the stadium and regularly attend the construction.
Remember, last night it was known that Metrostructure would complete the construction of Zenit Arena, and the contract value would be about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won the sales for the promotion of the territory around the stadium, the cost of the contract RU 2.4 billion roubles with the Transstrore Corporation, the International Corporation of Transs.
Two other companies were not allowed to fight for the construction of the stadium.
For more details on the choice of a new gene contractor, see the U.S. "Métrody" material on the field.
In Miassa, Chelabin district, the attorney of the former vice-hubernator Nikolai Sandakova Constantine Akulich was detained.
As reported by another lawyer of the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, Constantine Aculic was now called to the Messs Investigation Division for an indictment in the case of an annual time of beating.
Then Constantine Akulis left as a lawyer to help one of his attendants.
"In fact, it was initiated against the unidentified persons, and as he began to defend Nikolai Sandakova, it turned out to be Akulic," says Sergei Colosovski.
Constantine Aculic became the Deputy Governor's lawyer in early August.
In the meantime, half an hour before the call of a lawyer to the Mizas, the defence party was notified that on Monday, there was an expiration date for the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakova was accused.
Remember, two criminal cases have been instituted against Nikolai Sandakova.
In the first (fraud case), it is incriminated by a pledge of RU 1.5 million to assist in the appointment of the Mayor of Magnitohorsk Head of Administration of Lake Evangenia Tarasov.
The second criminal case relates to the bribe that Nicolas Sandakov allegedly received from the Director of the CPC, Piton, Igore Kaluvin, in the form of an illegal gratification of property services in the amount of at least 1.3 million roubles.
For details on Mr. Sandakova's case, see "The Former Vice Governor Requires to Combine His Cases."
The Russian copper company (RMC) stands ready to take social responsibility and to give more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMC has begun to modernize one of the oldest and ecologically polluted enterprises in the country, the Karabash medieval combination.
The Karabashch medieval plant was founded by an English shareholder society headed by Leslie Urkwart in 1910.
In Soviet times, this was important to the country ' s economy by an industrial enterprise, and it actually ensured the city ' s viability.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production had been stopped, resulting in serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash medieval combination.
One of the main challenges of the Karabash plant was environmental.
By the beginning of the 2000s, Karabash was already deplorably known as the zone of environmental disaster.
The situation at Carabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise had been managed by the Russian copper company.
The company has begun to modernize production, which has gradually diminished environmental pressures on the environment.
This has recently been noted by the Governor of the Chelabin Region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first issue of July.
The head of the South Ural described the dramatic changes that had taken place with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved into the RMC group.
The main activity to modernize Carabashmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sernoxlot ceiling to catch up to 99.9 per cent of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian copper company, the All-World Levin made an investment in the project of about 7 billion roubles.
The next phase of Karabashmed's modernization is the reconstruction of the reconnaissance.
The replacement of three converters, heatings, gas-propelled tract is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, a new 1 billion rubbish purification unit is planned to be launched.
In turn, there will be an increase in the amounts of taxes allocated to the city of Karabash.
Over the entire period of the Tominian GOC project - from the start of construction to the second turn - the Federal Treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
Once GOK has been introduced, tax revenues at all levels can be RU 80.9 billion.
During the year of production in the Varnen district, the budgets of the various levels are RU 346.3 million.
And that's in the first year.
"The longer the enterprise is successful, the amount may be greater," added Valerie Ulanovsky.
The RMC clarified that in 2015 tax deductions from the Micheev GOC were close to RU 1 billion.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of the territories is not limited to tax contributions.
RMC enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, cultural and recreational facilities, and to construct territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian copper company in Karabashe was capital repairs and, in fact, almost complete restructuring of N9 childcare for 95 tutors.
The building built in 1960 was in emergency.
Also in the territory of the RMC Arena, the landscape park with artificial ponds, underground and superground parkings will be located on 600 machines, cafés and sports shops.
The RMC Arena will allow for spectacular professional sports activities at the international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make exercises in physical and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to Chalbinsk residents, especially children.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering imposing sanction against the RF because of the breakdown of democrat servers.
U.S. officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the breakdown of the Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal with reference to sources.
In order to impose sanctions, Barak Obama ' s Presidential Authority is reported to have to formally accuse the attack on the Russian server or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other U.S. specialists are almost sure of Russia's involvement in cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the U.S. generally prefers not to name the hacker attackers.
The exception consists of a breakdown of Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, which was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
However, last year Obama issued a decree simplifying sanctions against those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally directed against China, but could be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions may be prolonged, writes out.
Even if officials concluded that the hackers had acted with the support of Russia, they would have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose information.
They have to determine whether the incident is so serious that it exacerbates tensions in bilateral relations.
Previously, Barak Obama ' s administration had reportedly allowed sanctions against a State whose hackers had hacked the servers of the Nazi Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks published an electronic correspondence of the National Democracy Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities could be involved in hacking.
In Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
Gog's FAS is almost half a million roubles.
There was a violation of the competition in the mobile apps market.
An antimonopoly proceeding was initiated at Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google provides Smartphone producers with access to Android components under conditions that prevented the distribution of applications from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
FAS found evidence of these claims and found that the company abused the dominant position on the market and imposed the mobile device manufacturers to install with Google Play other applications.
As a result of the review, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to order Google, informed the FAS leader Alexei Dánzko.
The penalty shall be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the Competition Protection Act should be respected by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to first examine the solution and only then determine further actions: to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violator of the competition law in September last year and ordered that the treaties be adjusted until 18 December.
But Google didn't agree to that.
Since then, the company and the department have been conducting judicial proceedings.
In the FAS, it was noted that despite a fine, they were discussing the possibility of a global agreement with Google.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This was the opinion of the Mobile Research Group, Eldar Murtazin, lead analyst.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

The Anime Snapchat effect is criticized as a cartoon for Asians.
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some surveyors say it's racially intact.
With the Snapchat Linza tool, about 150 million users a day change reality and play with the individual ways that border the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to pick up Roy Liechtenstein's painting.
Lenses are rude, distortive tools that produce over 30 million adjusted selphis a day.
Any mistakes are rapidly becoming known.
Lenses of Snapchat were exposed to criticism in the past when they were accused of advertising the dark skin of the person or encouraging elegant persons as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a line that gave them slanted eyes, crooked teeth, and tumble cheeks, some critics thought it was a racist cartoon on Asians, "joltolts."
And they wondered whether these repeated contradictions pointed to the more serious problem of a company related to diversity.
The following day, Snapchat stated that it had been removed from the report on The Verge and Motherboard.
The company commented that the lens was designed to be respectful of anime characters, not as a cartoon on Asians.
But experts who know not about racism were heard, Linza reminded of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others totally rejected anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Spapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about photographs was actively shared, said that the lens was “insulting and at least awkward”.
She added that "it was hard to argue with the comparison side by side of a very rough cartoon on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellows but highly degraded yellows.
Snapchat is not the only company going through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to be involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from the corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the devils that we all carry with ourselves.
And a huge audience of young people in Snapchat -- which are more racially diverse than their older generation -- can mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat's licenses creates an image offensive to the user, then, in an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Joe said, "it's much harder to remain unnoticed as it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the produce manager and the engineer who works for Medium, decided to remove their recording in Snapchat and encouraged others to do the same.
In the medium article and in the telephone interview, she said she believed that racial contradictions were the cause of insufficient diversity in the recruitment of staff in Snipchat.
Joe has criticized mostly the white leadership of a company consisting only of men and has completed her article by the Hashtego: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Joe, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: “As for them, there were not enough in the state to make such decisions, or they have white people, but they do not hold positions that are safe and open.”
Other surveyors share her view by expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to the trusted person, the company had recently hired a convert to focus on the underrepresented segments of the population and to actively attempt to involve domestic resources.
For her part, Joe said that she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to tell them they wouldn't go like this."
Military leadership distorted IGIL intelligence, reports the Congress Commission
The US Central Armed Forces Commanders changed intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than justified by the on-site events, reported by the Congress Commission in a report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Republican chairpersons of the House of Representatives Committee on Intelligence, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Expenditures found “the wide-ranging discontent” among the Central Command Intelligence Analysts who claim that the leaders have been contributing to their assessment of American actions aimed at winning the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centk, is the main military office in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“Intelligence documents approved by the Principal Command of the Centcom tended to be more optimistic about US anti-terrorist actions than evidence from the scene, and were stablely more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special services”, said the news news published in the dedicated report.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the highest authorities appear to be inappropriate, our military are suffering,” said a member of the Ken Calver House of Representatives, a Republican from California.
Leadership problems in Centcom are at the top of the organization.
The ten-page report deals in detail with the shortcomings that have persisted in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing American actions aimed at training Iraqi armed forces provided by Central Command.
Although he did not contain the final evidence that members of the Obama administration had ordered the falsification of reports, he argued that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership compelled them to have a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as IGIL or ISIL.
“ During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command at Congress were much more optimistic than real events,” reported the report.
For example, the Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, it's known for certain," said a statement by a member of the House of Representatives, Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the U.S. Central Command's highest Intelligence Manager falsified the team's intelligence to reduce the threat posed by IGIL in Iraq.
The Republicans had set up an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that the Islamic State's intelligence had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the reports issued on Thursday will follow the more detailed data.
The Pentcom's Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence conducts an additional, unfinished investigation.
Representatives of the Democratic Party to the Intelligence Committee of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress published their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Operational Group.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centk has established an overly closed intelligence procedure for IGIL and Iraqi security forces”, asserts the statement by the member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, the principal representative of the democratic party in the committee.
This procedure, according to Shiffa, “restrained the issuance of intelligence documents”, has damaged the moral state of analysts and “is inadequately reflecting divergent views”.
But Shiffe and Democrats claim that they have not found evidence that the White House has tried to force Centcom analysts to reach their conclusions under “due or political interpretation”.
Preliminary results of the Congress's investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast portal.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Chief Inspector of Pentagon, opened after the complaints of the Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Congress while the investigation of the Chief Inspector was ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes differ in the interpretation of integrated data, and special services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital topics of national security”.
The results of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the U.S. bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now asserts by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's statements make it wonder whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of intelligence in the Islamic State reiterates the disputes that took place over ten years ago, when a research article by the research analyst at Centcom Gregory Huker stated that the Administration of President George Woker Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, had expressed support for a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought that it would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest caused by the Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, the Huker team concluded that, despite public declarations of reverse, airlines on oil plants belonging to the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group because it had built temporary oil plants to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, as reported in September in Times.
Commander Centcom, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after the testimony in the Senate, which many members considered too optimistic.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by Hen. Joseph L. Votel in Central Commandment.
4 consecutive winners in female hokkea on grass, thus getting closer to a decisive confrontation with Britain
Katie Bem once killed three naked in a match that ended with a victory over Japan with a 6-1 account, opened the account on Thursday with the first two heads for the U.S. female hokkey team on the grass when the Americans won a 3-0 team.
Five heads in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bem, 27, claims she would not be sure if she did something like that.
"I'm not gonna give it to you," she said.
I'm actually not one of the people who track their naked.
She knows that the count of Americans is 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they are competing for the first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after the failure of Japan, with 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first tour.
Both teams claim for a quarterfinal, and the result of the game will determine who will be the first in their team of six teams and who is the second.
The winner will run away from a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little bit of weather when the games begin with a quarterfinal.
However, Saturday game shows that the Americans here made their unexpected series of noises, four years after they took their last place among the 12 teams in London Games.
Bem was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, for the first time, she took Hokkey blade on her grass when she was 3 (older sisters playing this sport in Drexel), and joined the 16-year-old national assembly, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed Olympiad 2008 when she did not pass the selection tour into the final composition.
Then came 2012, when everything went wrong with her and her teammates.
Next year, Coig Parnham, Englishman, was appointed coach and everything started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, changes in physical training," said Bem.
In London, we did not have the productivity that we now have.
We've completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the account in the first half of the game with a discomfortful hand for a short distance.
India came to the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprised to be rigid and kept the account 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bem took the initiative in her hands.
She made a long walk with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiral went in the middle and sharply sent the ball to the gate, thus giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa González added a final naked in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry victory was the first tournament to the United States of America, Jackie Briggs, who missed one bare in each of the first three wins.
She's hitting me.
So is Bem.
"We're in a good position right now," said Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday Game.
In the midst of the hostility of the Olympic Games, leaps on the Batuta
Wherever you were, no matter how much time you were, it's Olympics.
Rio events seem unchangeable and inevitable, and it's a wretched combination of competition and aspirations.
It's like the Olympic fire itself, and there's the burning torch that goes from the ray to the swimmer, to the hymnast, to the triatlonist.
You can't turn on TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors in turn in the cafe and not hear about Simon Bayles, Katie Ledeka or the hostility between Michael Felps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who first participated in the Olympic Games, a beauty with holes on the cheeks, could be among the celebrities that are shown in the Primme, which are being promoted by sponsors and vibrant advertising videos if he were a pilot, a gymnast, or even a fechtiller.
But the 28-year-old Dooley of Lake Farrest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic battut races.
The Olympic Fire does not cover all events equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not generally recognized: pneumatic gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, teckwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I'm allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal passion, let me draw your attention to the modest roaming of the leaps on the battut.
Although battalion jumps have been the Olympic sport since 2000, when they were debuting in Sydney games, they have received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed have not been aware that they are generally related to the Olympic sports.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States and sent athletes to compete, they never won the medals in the battoo jumps, and their athletes did not go to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russian tend to share male rewards, while Chinese and Canadians are female.
Dan Dune of China and Rose McLennan of Canada will protect their London gold medals this year.
But leaps on the battut have a ballm of outsider, in particular because the ear is more affiliated with the circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I must admit that I'm not an expert, but just a landed enthusiasm.
They really have a comic potential — a caricural leap of endless jumps — but also an elegance of gymnastics and leaps into water, two kinds of sports that they mostly combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín" meaning "temple for jumps in water."
The candidates for victory are jumping at a giant battut, flying almost 30 feet in the air, and they have to carry out a series of acrobatic tricks (wavers, pits and saltos) before final landing on their feet.
They are assessed according to the performance, complexity and “flight times” of the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most widely distributed Olympic course is forward.
The applicants for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes finish, and sometimes back and forth, down to the field.
They seek not only the finishing line or the opening wall, but also the television cameras, to another tightly line: the world record or the Olympic record.
It is a persistent desire of nobleness, worthy of admiration, even fanaticly, and enough to make the spectator tear up.
But it seems to me to be somewhat tired of watching Games.
He's got jumps on the battalion.
The direction of the battutist is upward.
Move forward is not a target.
He or she jumps, it seems vague, like an astronaut, flys upwards, then down, then without effort again upwards.
And they, of course, are not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the entire programme there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no jumps of length, only a strange, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the most closest to Zena of the Olympic Sports.
Women ' s qualifications and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcasting an hour of East European time; males on Saturday, also an hour.
NBC will transmit the final to the day programme from 14:00 to 2 p.m. to 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, it is expected that a calm, beautiful moment can easily be seen in the overall landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can be achieved only by giving male athletes passionate views and objectiveization — as reported by Wall Street Journal, recently suspected by hurricane men from the United States — Dooley only waits for its newly admired crowd of fans.
"The generation protests" in Ethiopia, the old U.S. allies
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators requiring political change in Ethiopia have faced a grim opposition from the Government.
Eyewitnesses say that dozens of protesters have been fatally wounded during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia really at the point of friction?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, anti-Government protests have shocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
Just in the last week, thousands of people have gone to the streets, demanding radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government ' s reaction was cruel.
The eyewitnesses claimed that the police officers had shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video recordings from protest sites allegedly removed at the end of the past or early this year show how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were handed to the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It was always difficult to keep this country from breaking down, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project in the international crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services have worked closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably — even a new suburban train in the capital of Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy — human rights organizations were constantly mentioning government repression - the opposition in the territory of States was suppressed by the fact that the dissidents were forced to shut down.
Many of them were sentenced, imprisoned, killed or expelled into remote deserts.
But it can change.
“If people constantly oppress and leave them with other options except as to protest, there will be a revolt,” said Seyum Teshome, a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
All young people protest.
The generation protests.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use, ending with the seizure of government coalition.
Following the widely criticized elections last year, the Government party and its allies have completely stripped the opposition and are now controlling 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tension along the Eritrean border is increasing; the struggle for this uncertain, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, which have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may attempt to use disturbance and rearm.
A number of factors explain why the bitter feelings that burst into the heart for several years are now inclined.
The first one would seem completely harmless: smartphones.
In just the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social networks, as cheap smartphones have become common and Internet services are better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find opportunities to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized themselves for protests.
The second, there is greater solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from mostly the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, has prospered in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of which are Muslims and live in low areas.
But it's also changing.
"We'll act together at the same beginning," said Mulatu Hemech, leader Oromo.
The major protests have taken place in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that in Ethiopia, members of the Tigray ethnic group are unjustly dominated by about 6 per cent of the population, which controls military and intelligence services, trade and policy.
A third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, up to his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could have foreseen the danger.
Analysts claim that he has particularly skilledly recognized the first signals of discontent and used spies to obtain data and clear opponents.
“The current regime lacks sound sense,” said Abdi, analyst of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalen, came from nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was born from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam, southern Ethiopia.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands of people protested that, as analysts had said, there appeared to have been elections that the Government had overturned and then failed.
In the aftermath of the repression, many Protestants were killed, although in fewer numbers than in the last months, and this period of turmoil has passed relatively fast.
The development experts expressed their appreciation to Ethiopia ' s leaders for the far-reaching development of infrastructure, such as a new urban train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
It is obvious, however, that this did not stop the growing domestic resentment of the Government of Ethiopia.
It takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, Amhar city, attacked Tiger-owned enterprises and the anti-Tigra hatred in social networks became comprehensive.
Analysts claim that the protesters make the United States and other Western allies uncomfortable.
The American Government had used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it was clear that the West wanted to support democracy, but on the other hand, it did not want its allies to lose power in the already volatile region.
"And it's hard to get through this drained rope," said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his statement that IGIL was founded by Obama, "sarcasm."
Donald J. Trump attempted to tamper the last conflict that covered his pre-election headquarters on Friday, stating that he had jogged several times this week that President Obama and Hillari Clinton had been “founders” of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The clarification raised new questions regarding the ability of the President of the Republican Party to speak prudently to the American people.
It also placed his deputies who tried to protect him during the period of excruciation in a frustrating situation, as they had to explain what he probably had in mind.
Speaking of this assumption at Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton had founded the IGIL.
But in Twitter early Friday Trump wrote that he was just riding.
This post was a direct contrast to the allegation made only one day earlier when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his charge.
When the radio conservator Hughitt tried to help Tempu soften the speech, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy HIGIL, the candidate for the presidency of the Republican party did not avail himself of the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when the Trump tried to reorient its campaign against the economy in the background of a decline in ratings.
The Trump and Clinton presented competing talks about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to that subject again.
Once again he resorted to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and said that he felt her speech was boring.
The trump used sarcasm earlier as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he had taken on a general criticism, almost saying that Russians should break Clinton's email, he later explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I'm kidding."
This approach allows the Tram to go beyond the political speech allowed and to take their words back, if necessary.
"I think it's his way to test the responses of his worshipers, to watch them act, and then to explain them in one way or another, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, an expert on communication, conducting an analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about his comments and knows that they're vague enough to interpret them differently.
Instead of softening the voices for a broad electrator, the Trump has taken even more delicate tone in the last days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that the Trump is going down to Clinton with a high hurdle in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and going with it in Florida.
Although Trump tends not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words and misunderstandings his senses of humor.
But since the Trump had become a target of greater attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, his jokes made his faithful allies uncomfortable: they had to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements were.
Rudolf U. Juliani, former Mayor of New York, who is one of the most famous deputies of the Tram, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate for an interview given by the CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political commentary," said Juliani when he was asked about the validity of the Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama IGIL was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it a non-threatening, totally unjust, and that's why it happened, because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
The majority of the average republicans believe that the Obama administration, in which Clinton was the secretary of the State, allowed IGIL to develop because it was not able to settle the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to a meeting in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media in Twitter for the loosening and biasing of each of his words.
He harassed "poor miserable" television experts who tried to solve him and said, "They are weak!"
Some democrats have ridiculed the Trump's acquittal, as mere proof that he does not belong to the Presidents.
The caffeine is back in Greenpoin someday.
Verb's Coffee was harassed, taking only a cash place in Williamsberg, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was stripped out of her room with a vitrine on Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri Magazine, who took the place of Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the renewed city.
Artist Molly Krabaple wrote in Twitter, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Hotel Chelsey is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store."
But while New York is constantly changing, it's in turn updated.
Verb's restored coffee was opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbee has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but there are some of the same staff members and a similar simple atmosphere.
Besides, coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, an old caffeine officer who is the owner and general manager in the new place.
He started working in Verbet in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to offer him in a new place, he said that he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, has left a lot behind.
The Verb works with the same beigel distribution and bought the same model of the cafe car.
It's even fitted with the old Verb's lobsters.
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu presents bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and there is a topping of capers or baked onions.
There's some brown rice dishes.
Caffeine doesn't get any more beer, but it's getting freshly cut juice.
Nine months later Rodriguez said that he drew attention to the constant flow of old permanent clients.
"Many former clients have also paid price from Williamsberg," he said.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Oliviair was one of those clients.
Olivieira, who was 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoin, she still drove there.
After Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that implanted me in Verbee," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, although that day, instead of the regular Ice Coffee, she ordered the purchase tea, another new one.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing client, devotedly visited Verb, starting in 2003.
He went to work and ordered the same.
"Fifteen minutes eighth, every day as I came in clock, and my beigle was cooked for me with oil and all the pots," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes in the menu.
Today, Rosenthal is still doing a regular order, but one day he will change something with bacon, eggs or cheese on the beigle with all the pots.
Rodriguez said he wasn't insulted that the soap store once caught the old spot.
Moreover, the owners of the Soup Sheri proposed making a special soap for Verba, using caffeine prepared in a cold manner as a ingredient.
"I think we may agree to their offer," said Rodriguez.
The residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also loved this caffeine.
One of these new clients has translated a menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he was planning to find a place for him in the virina to make his new neighbors feel desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local dot for the sale of juice plans to pour on bottles and sell coffee prepared in the cold manner.
It is likely that a neighboring building will join the caffeine.
For many customers, it's enough to put a new Verb on the menus of their favorite dishes.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and told him that he was murdered when they were closed.
When the coffee was opened, Whitt said that when he entered and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
"How long I wanted to feel this smell," he confessed.
Depressive Depression Food in the Fleet Bay.
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Cabinet.
As a gurman, President Roosevelt loved the fashioned foods of the Fifth Avenue, such as the Fua gra and the Meriland turtle soup.
Its menu on that day was more modest: bulging eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes, and pudding desserts from blackwood.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to feed."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Hates are specialists in the history of food.
The last book of Koua, "Rague Chinese" was devoted to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Zigelman told the history of life in a rented apartment in the Lower East City through food in her book The House 97 Street of the Fruit Garden.
Their new joint work "Fleet Bayza", which will be published on Tuesday by Harper, is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
By showing some degree their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Fletayron quarter, which has been working since 1929, the year of Birge Crashe.
Zigelman, 54, ordered olive cheese and sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took an turkey, potatoes, and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple thought it was a suitable starting point for the discussion of food in the age of Depression.
"The Rounds were a lot of demand," said Zigelman.
There was a peanut roller, liver roll, a beaver roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to grow.
Imagine that you ate as much peanut as you need for dinner.
Cow's intruding.
"He must have been in his stomach with a stone," he said.
During the years before the depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Women ' s groups were cooked for men working on the farm, and the fresh-burned pie was given for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during World War I. The Fresh Traese describes how the country managed that suddenly ceased to be a country of wealth.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and bakers, became the main foods; the bakery is "a beautiful way to dispose of meals," said Zigelman, "because the cooks could hide neappetite ingredients under the dense layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dryfruits.
The meat, for many years the former base of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary health.
By studying a book that includes recipes, Zigelman prepared a meal of that era — a baked bow, a peanut - oiled butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was unsuccessful," said Kow.
Zigelman added, "It was very weird."
The peanut oil does not fit completely into the liver's bow.
This was characteristic of many household prescriptions.
More than ever since then, home specialists — including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Bureau from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s food habits.
After publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budgeters," to take a challenge and turn a pot like a protein spaghetti with a carrot into a tasted dish.
The "fleet dish" is a party of interesting historical facts.
Particularly peculiar to the Government's response to hungry citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Guver in the spirit of "the emptiness of eating pie."
Publicly glorifying the simple farming strain of Iowa's age of his childhood, he was feeding like a delicate millionaire to become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, the fish with the oguretic sauce," he said to Ko.
He eats almost in a golden dining ceiling, wearing tuxedo.
He was fantasticly ripped off of reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleonor, had not asked him to set an example in his own stomach.
According to the book Eléonor Roosevelt hired an economy that was completely uninterested, and that led to the white house “not only to use the most deplorable food in Washington, but sometimes the most repugnantly prepared.”
Many of the clinical admissions of the age of Depression were forgotten as soon as the country reappeared.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Zigelman, and the way science has been used in cooking.
They say that while writing a book, they were better able to understand the food habits of Zigelman’s mother — that she could not throw out food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being negligent about eating," said Coe.
Zigelman remembers, "She's seriously poisoned people."
There was one bad case of profiling.
When the plates in Eisenberg's were deserted, they and Coe got a dessert that was cooked at home, a dessert from the blackwood that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called the Chronicle Mussel," said Zigelman, adding that it was a popular reception to give modest recipe bro names.
There were no smashed plums, only blackflies, some torments, sugar, water, and cinnamons.
Everyone was reluctant to load a spoon into a viscosity, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Koe asked for more two times.
In the voice of a certain budget writer, he said to his wife, “Would not be confused by a few greek nuts.”
Arrest of members of the mass fight in the Hovan cemetery extended until 14 November
The Presen Court left the mass fighters in the Khovan cemetery until 14 November and granted the relevant application for investigation.
In the case 14 persons are accused.
Remember, on 14 May, a mass fight took place in the Hovan cemetery of several hundred people from Middle Asia and the North Caucasus using weapons that killed three people.
Alexander Bocharnikov, former chief of the cemetery of Yuri Chabuev and the jurist, co-sponsor of the Health Nation, was charged with murder.
The issue of the second pension index in 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by the Vice-President of the Government of the RF, Olga Holodovic, during the visit to the Brensk region.
We have specific parameters to increase the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Economists are now taking half-year stock, and we're going to complete this work in the next two-three weeks, quoting Interfax Holocaust.
Commenting on the six-year increase in pension age for six months proposed by the Head of the Strategic Development Centre, Alexey Kudrino, the Vice-President reported that the topic was not addressed in the cabmina.
At the end of July, it was known that the Government had agreed on a position to fully index pension payments in 2017.
Kamen and Grigorian went to the end of the shooting competition from a small caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamenski and Cyril Grigorian went to the end of a small caliber shooting rifle at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TACS, Sergei Kamenski recruited 629 points and took the first place is the new Olympic record of qualifications.
Cyril Grigorian became the second - 628.9 was.
Eight best athletes went to the final.
Kamenski is the world recordman in this discipline (633).
The Turkish Oppositioner Fethullah Gulen requires an international investigation into the attempt to coup d ' état in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempt to coup d'état,” quotes Gülena, French Le Monde.
Also, the Turkish opponent said, "if any part of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gulen denies involvement in a coup, emphasizing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul Court had previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullach Gülene in a previous time.
Recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night from 15 to 16 July.
Gilead Companies will reimburse the costs of legal services during a dispute for a patent from hepatitis C with Merck
The Gilead Sciences Inc company has the right to receive the reparation for the costs of the lawyers that it had incurred in connection with the patents of hepatitis C practitioners with Merck & Co Inc, the Federal District Judge has decided.
In June, the Gilead company was relieved of $200 million for violating the two Merck patents related to the medications of Gilead, the sale leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including a lie under oath and other unethical practices.
When speaking on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman of the U.S. Federal District Court said that the Gilead company has the right to reimburse the costs incurred during the appeal.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominant in the new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck brought each other to court, claiming their rights to laboratory work underlying the sophosbyre, an active drug ingredient of Gilead.
Armed forces established with the support of the United States claim that they overtook the full control of Manbig from the Islamic State
The armed forces established with the support of the United States took full control of the northern town of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Islamic State militants left, informed the group on Friday.
The Syrian democratic forces (FDS) are now cleaning the city after the remaining group of militia who have been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants from Charfan Darwish to Reuter from the Manbija Military Council Union with the FDS.
"The city is under our control now, but we're doing cleanup operations," he said to Reuters.
Klinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax
Hillari Clinton issued its 2015 tax declarations on Friday, which showed that the candidate for Presidents from the democratic party and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received some $5.3 million in fees for presentations, and the former State Secretary announced an income of $3 million from the publisher, Simon & Schuster, for her book of posting in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife Anna Holton, promulgated tax declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard of financial transparency,” said in a statement by Clinton Jennifer Palmieri, elected headquarters adviser.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind forged excuses and violates his past promises to promulgate his tax declarations.
This is a customary case for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although the law does not require that.
The New York Businessman Trump and his lawyers referred to the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to promulgate his tax declarations.
"Your moves," wrote a Twitter adviser at Clinton Jan Sams, the electoral headquarters, referring to the declaration of a candidate for a democratic party.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Trampa Michael Cohen said to the CNN that he would not allow the Tram to release them before the end of the checks.
Critics of the Trump, including the candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitta Romney and other Republican gatherings, said that his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton caught up for this question and released an online video on Friday, which focused on distinguished Republicans who persuaded Tempa to proclamate tax reporting.
On Thursday, she raised this issue during the talk on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone has done, without exception, for decades as a presidential candidate: to publish his tax declarations," she said to the meeting.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump had not paid any tax or almost any tax in the 1990s, and the New York Times business inspector quoted many tax lawyers and accountants on Friday that might still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become the subject of a dispute in the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rule called a billionaire investor, Warren Buffett, which would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 per cent.
President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, in Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Tramp to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he was also under the IRS check, and that Trump "fears" is not a tax-gathering agency, but a voter.
Clinton's pre-election headquarters issued tax declarations up to 2007.
Clintons now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective total tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was a source of wages.
Their main investment was an inexpensive petroleum index fund, and Klintons announced dividends and capital income of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
In Tanzania, environmental fighters use a non-traditional way to prevent elephants from hiding in settlements — condoms filled with powdered chili.
The method was effective, and Honeyguide Foundation, which came to the mind of this idea a few years ago, along with the American Nature Protection Committee, took on its advancement by teaching volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, consisting of four steps, a way to protect their homes and crops without causing harm to animals.
Earlier, many used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"After we have invented a set of tools..., we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, which makes them much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without causing harm to elephants," said the executive director Honeyguide Demiian Bell.
The first two steps are to heal the torch before an elephant breaking the border and to signal the horn.
If he hasn't been scared, they're throwing the so-called chili cloud.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the cotton in the condom, and its end is twisted, and only the phitil is left outside.
When the condoms are ignited, they burst into the air, spraying a small dust of powder.
One play is usually enough to turn the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launching device that shoots Roman candles into the air by making a loud, brilliant explosion.
To date, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who have left the country after an attempt to retreat in July this year.
Such data led the Head of the Turkish Ministry of Internal Affairs, Mellut Chawashoglu, in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we called on 208 staff diplomats to continue their work in the centre.
Of these, 32 persons have not returned without objective reasons and explanations," said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
Recall that a coup attempt had taken place in Turkey in July.
The authorities officially stated that the fugitives had failed and that more than six thousand persons had been detained, including high-level and middle-level military activities.
According to the Turkish Ministry of Public Transition, 290 people were killed as a result of the attempt.
The Jewish director severely criticized the Berlin Hotel for the removal of Israeli phone code by "request" Arabs - reported the RT News channel
The French director of Jewish origin had unleashed a scandal in the media, finding that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no telephone code in Israel, and they referred to “requests” from Arab clients.
Claude Lancemann, author of the documentary film on the Holocoste "Shoa", expressed his displeasure by the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, writing an open letter to the FAZ German media.
During his recent visit to the hotel, Lanceman tried to find Israel on the hotel phone code list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the States to which a call could be made directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, Israel was expelled and eradicated in Berlin, the capital of a new Germany?
I wrote Lanceman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service centre.
In search of explanation, the director raised this issue on the hotel administration's stand.
The answer he received, according to Lanceman, "has hurt him."
Clank Hotel said that the measure was "a thoughtful decision by Kempinski's hotel network."
The reason behind this step was even more raged by the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed,” said Lanceman, who serves as a hotel.
Israeli Ambassador Jacob Hadas Handelsman in Germany described the case as “a terrible shame,” reports Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by an incident.
It's really a terrible shame.
What this happened in Germany and in this hotel network is even more disgraceful.
We don't need an explanation here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused a huge resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski hotel was just "went on" with the alleged Arab client demands.
"Would be offended," said another post, which indicated that the hotel on the famous street of Kurfurstendamm was located next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has hurried to dismiss any charges, calling it "untreated" and "repunished" to Lanceman, reports The Der Spiegel.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of quick recruitments," quotes the representative of the hotel Kempinski newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian protesters
The students met the police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday, when they met to protest government reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Disorders began when police officers tried to dismantle students, resulting in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their concern over the plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of the State of São Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 State secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redeployed to save money.
Some protesters were seen writing on the graffiti walls against the temporarily acting President Michael Temer.
This last protest took place just a few days after the protesters went to the streets to support the dismissed President Dilma Rucef when the Senate voted in favour of her impressiveness.
Commerce between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% - Reported by the RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, the trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the previous year, according to Ambassador Levan Jagarian of Iran.
Since international sanctions against Iran had been lifted, there was a growing interest among Russian firms in business in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are renewing communication with Iran and new firms are ready to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagarian.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran had increased by 70.9 per cent compared with the same period in 2015 to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent, to $158 million.
Increased trade has been achieved through the supply of machine equipment, ground vehicles and weapons,” said the Ambassador.
Jagarian also predicts that Russia will visit the record number of Iranian tourists this year.
Last year the Russian diplomatic representation in Iran issued some 35,000 visas, mostly to tourist citizens of Iran.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered top-20 countries by number of tourists visiting Russia.
You can confidently say that last year's record of the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians are visiting Iran, which the Ambassador hopes to change.
“I personally recommend to visit the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yedes, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition,” he said.
The State continues to twist gays in a defence and industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was the “systematic failure” of the genitor's assignments to the concept “Almaz-Antay”, “permission” and “loss of confidence”.
The head of the NGO has been appointed Hennady Bendersky for the next three years.
Information on the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not resonance in the media.
How can such silence be explained in a major rearrangement of the army?
It is likely that the management of the FM does not wish to distribute any hearings or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This reaffirms that the defence and industrial complex (OPC) has many problems and the State does not wish to attract increased attention from society.
The removal of the Nescorodov is undoubtedly an important development in terms of order in the industry.
Almaz NGOs are the main business of the concept, which specializes in the production of marine and land-based air defence systems (MDGs).
Almaz is currently working on the establishment of Polyment Reduth and Morpheus, which is planned to be placed on new corvates, fregates, esminants and creaves.
The founder of the Navy portal, Dmitry Kornev, believes that the dismissal of Nescorodov is caused by the breakdown of the project period.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheta began as early as 2007 and was expected to be introduced in 2013.
The “Polment-Readut” should be the main ERW system on the latest WMF ships.
According to the information I receive, no tests have been carried out in a few years.
True, as far as I can judge, there's no unequivocal fault of Almaza, says Kornev.
The expert fears that a delay in the introduction of the operationalization may occur with the AWG “P-500”.
Experienced design work on the project has not yet been completed, but the first complexes must enter the troops during 2016.
In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is assured that “the work is being planned and will be completed within the time frame,” although in 2014 the department recognized the problems with the development of the P-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the competencies of Nescorodov, who led Almaz since 2011.
The root observed that project breakdowns could be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his view, it had become extremely difficult in recent years to obtain information on internal processes in the CPC and business management plans.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billion roubles, and big money is known to love silence.
Generally, the directors of defence companies depart from their posts, under the contract of agreement of the parties, or are reassigned to other work.
In this case, the removal took place publicly, although it did not receive resonance.
It's implying that Almaza's leader was probably a strangling figure and resisted the descending "farheads."
It seems that the State does not intend to accept such conduct anymore.
By the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to dispute with Minoбороna ' s installations and fail to carry out their tasks.
At the same time, the management of the RF seeks to punish the provoked managers (Machinations on the Starfier).
The President has focused on sector issues personally.
Vladimir Putin is headed by the Military Industrial Commission and meets periodically on rearming.
The Kremlin protects the JPK managers in an effort to have a loyal team of directors who will comply with the orders received from above.
This is a far-reaching policy, but against the background of corruption and the lack of normal competition in the CPC, there are no other instruments available to the State.
The defensive situation, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical environment stimulates the Kremlin to bring order to the Armed Forces as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleaning” of managers in the CPC, the management of the RF is taking quite successful steps to enhance the professionalism of Russian troops.
The army ' s personnel force has acquired a new quality with Sergei Schoyg, Minister of Defence.
It seems that the President has adopted a famous saying, "Wish peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which embodied the Moscow sphere of influence on the continent.
In all the deficiencies of the bipolar system, it worked effectively.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East proved to be proof of that.
The conquest of “conquesters” in the cold war eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, there seems to be no quiet corner left.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak to Russia at the level of the same partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the fleet and the army.
The strengthening of military power will enable Moscow to promote national interests more effectively and to reach new levels of world policy.
Scottish Kalum Skinner runs through the finish line, which takes up cyclical gold.
Scottish Kallum Skinner went to the triumph of a man’s team spin at the giant in Rio last night, which protected the British commander’s title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgo had been the strongest one his friend Scottish, Sir Chris Hoy, had made his own, and the young man was proud to go into history by finishing a straight line to break the victory of the Favorith team from New Zealand.
Britain had declared its right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning the five of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixths at the Martian World Championship on the tracks in London, even though Hoy's finished his career since then.
The question between Beijing and London was replaced by a specialist from Jemi Stoff.
They did it just when Hindes came.
Hoy's way out also created the emptiness that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a person held by British coaches, seeing the potential in Scotland, which was now being implemented.
Hindes, Kenny — champions with Hoy four years ago — and Skinner set up the Olympic record of qualifications, but the norm was exceeded by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his circle, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change in the strategy was a major part of the transformation where Hindese was on a larger transfer to slow down and enable Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy observed from his seat as an invited expert BBC and caught the view of Skinner, Kenny and Hindez when they entered the pedestal.
Skinner, 23-year-old from Glasgo, said, "It's a flat comparison."
I'm here to do everything I can to make my own name.
We established the Olympic Record in the Final and won the world's champions.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the London triumph in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes deliberately fell on a track after a failure to start.
He later renounced the commentary and there was no way to appeal from British competitors.
There was no such question this time for the greatest victory.
Hendez said, "I felt like in London, with all the British flags on the rostrum."
We've all met like a team in the last three months.
We played so many races with a world name that winning the lympic again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If it's a barometer of progress in the last five months, then there's five more successful days.
With Kenny's form, it's not beyond the opportunity to imagine how he repeats Hoy's voyage, winning three Olympic gold medals in some Games.
This would enable Kenny, a 12 - year - old Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (this appears to be a sacred date in British sport, also the birth day of Steve Redgreyv, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister), to bring his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It would've been like Hoy.
Next time, Kenny is competing in a sprint, which starts today and plays for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying it now.
Commands are always the best.
You're coming to win with your comrades.
A little lonely winning one, honestly.
He said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he will have to get the knight.”
It was the only day to play medals, but there were subsequent good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clansy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull are qualified for the fastest four-kilometre team race.
They were completed at 3:51,943.
The world record set at the winner of gold in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will certainly be at the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifications, when officials demanded him to measure his weight.
The corresponding women's event, which is renewed and finalized tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Elinore Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavi, improved the world record by pointing out time 4:13.260.
The British Command has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to own the average Olympic Games and to earn a bunch of medals.
Indeed, after the exceptional demonstrations of full superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas at the second level, not the latest -- the departure from the position of technical director Shein Sutton in April because of the accusations of sexism and oppression, and the departure of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening race, it seems that Britain’s legendary glory is now now to reach its peaks at the right time, perhaps again.
The future of the portland metallurgical plant threatened by the discontinuation of the electric power contract
The future of the Portland Aluminium Manufacturer in Victoria, as well as the workplaces of hundreds of workers, is threatened by the fact that the electricity company that supplys the factory, according to one of the owners of the factory, is going to terminate the contract of supply: all contracts are expected to be terminated.
This step is the result of a decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria not to extend subsidies to support the operation of the factory.
The fixed grant for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
2,000 jobs — directly and indirectly — can be found in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional indirect effects may also be, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 per cent of the power produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical factory at Point Henry, which led to the shutdown of the power plant in Angles last year.
The Portland metallurgical plant of Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have been the result of reflection on the future of the factory for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar and later due to the price of the factory.
Company AGL, which provides a large aluminium plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, reported that it would expect the other three owners to take steps to discontinue the contract.
The control share of the factory belongs to the joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
“The company AGL expects the portland object to continue to work, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical factory will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are the so-called 'heeded contracts' that were due to enter into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month separation period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"AGL is still expecting these contracts to bring their share of the income in the fiscal year 2017," said the electric power company.
Any potential influence on the profits of AGL from the financial year 2018 is now limited to projections on the strong market of fuchers for whole prices of electricity.
AGL stated that it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in terms of “presumptive dissolution”.
According to Alcoa, the decision to discontinue contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to run a metallurgical factory or to supply electricity to a metallurgical plant”.
The American company stated that in 2010, Loy Yang had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was due to enter into force in November this year, but it still had to explain why she had terminated the contract.
The analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Manufacturer in Victoria and the Tomago factory near Newcastle because of the adverse economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, the head of the operating service of AGL Steven Mikkelson said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year and Tomago is about 900 megawatts each year.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in market demand [electropower].
It will be bad for us as a producer," he said.
Not just a realistic-show star, Kendall on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendalle Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter of the Clan Kardashian-Genner of Maternal Manager Chris, appeared on the tentative September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who was the face of brand Estee Lauder and deflected the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in her instability on Thursday.
"Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried," wrote Kendall.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange news (or simply in the spirit of the Seventh Kardashian?) prepared by a realistic Video, in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshire Rob and Caitlin, as well as the most beloved show-bearer, producer of the Family Kardashian, Ryan Sicrest), forgot the sister's appearance on the cover and, at the end, a classic turn: they were planning a party-surpris.
It's a standard playline of almost all the episodes of child television show dedicated to birthday.
Because with this episode dedicated to September Vogue, we certainly entered the new era of Kardashian show.
Let Kendall Kim's older sister go to Vogue's cover (she and her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the most sold Vogue issue per year.
A thin, more like a gift magazine than a fashion magazine, attracts a large number of advertisers (615 pages from last year ' s 832-page edition, according to the Fashionist portal).
News of who the stars will fall on its cover is so eager that the photographs of the magazine have been combined to the official anons in the past two years.
The previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover certainly had more “signaries that operate models” than“ models that are celebrities”.
The Oscar Prize Laureate and Brenda Dior Jennifer Lawrence were presented on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gague's honor.
But even in the unlikely case, if Jenner, who the magazine described as the "predominant model" of his generation, falls into the first category, it's in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of known people, stars of realistic show or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are truly talented women who are successful in the entertainment industry.
For Beyons, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful careers in the Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
The situation of Jenner in the fashion world, in view of her last TV show star, should have always been confused.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret Stephanie Seymour models criticized Jenner and her colleague, Jiji Hadid, calling them "bitches of moment."
These moods broke out again after Jenner's report on Vogue's cover.
But it doesn't make sense to be dissatisfied.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September Vogue.
It is a super model in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiled for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you the tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, are selling you their photos in their own apps available on a pay subscription.
She's selling her own photos of Sindy Crawford's LOVE magazine.
And in free time, maybe to still see her sister Cortney and her children, she's involved in a realist show on TV.
Public legal centres refuse to service 160,000 people per year
Every year, more than 160,000 least protected populations are denied services in public legal centres, as the sector is preparing for a effect that will further reduce funding to and thus lead to limited opportunities.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly older, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to combat unjust property deprivation, and so forth — have already been denied in an effort to obtain free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already outside the capacity are preparing for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres have to lose 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Public Legal Centres of Queensland, said that according to the latest Census of the National Association of Public Legal Centres, thousands of people have been denied annually.
Farrell said that if the Federal Government's decision was not annulled, the situation would only deteriorate.
“Quinsland's general legal centres are constantly underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relations, people with unmanaged and deplorable debts, divorced families, unjustly dismissed workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot receive the assistance they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 per cent since June 2017, and thus thousands of less secure residents in Queensland will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland, George Brandis, to cancel these reductions immediately so that people can receive the necessary assistance when faced with legal problems.
Last year, the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the country ' s average.
Now is the time to draw attention to the needs of public legal centres and communities and their clients, and the Government of the Palachuk is about to join in this important work.
Donald Trump was brought to court at the election headquarters after a staff member allegedly threatened with a gun.
Reports from New York reported that Donald Trampa ' s pre-election headquarters had been brought to court: it was alleged that the headquarters had done nothing after the communication that his operating director in North Carolina had threatened the staff member with a gun when they were driving in the Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a judicial action filed on Wednesday to a state court at Charlotte Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state election headquarters.
Bordini said he had waited a few months to resolve the problem internally, but he realized that it would not happen.
Director Earl Phillip "screws his gun, puts his right finger on the chicken and puts a doll on Vincent's knee cup,” says Bordini in a complaint.
Upon appealing to the local and regional office of the electoral headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more persons had been involved in similar incidents with Phillips were alleged in the treatment.
"Pistolettes don't have to shoot to hurt," said Bordiny in the complaint.
The suit took place only two days after the candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party launched a fuor, saying to the audience in North Carolina that “the people of the Second Amendment” — the understandable arms owners and their lovers — could begin to act if his rival Hillari Clinton was elected and could choose judges.
The Trimpa electoral headquarters said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not expressed support for violence.
In his complaint, Bordini required compensation from the electoral headquarters for negligence and Phillip for the threat of physical violence, insults and moral harm.
The representative of Trump Hope Hicks has responded to a request for a comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently left the election headquarters.
In response to the call to his consulting firm, the Innovative Consulting Services, no one called quickly.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Superior Court of Meklenburg (Sharlott).
Britain must move the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Hitrow
Hethrou will also bring rebirth and prosperity not only in our local settlements and in general in London, but throughout the country.
For me, that was the great advantage of Hitrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to make our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been of great benefit to Stratford and East End.
And we'll do that again by creating opportunities for local residents and firms next to Heitrow.
For our local settlements alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think that the expansion of Hitrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic games, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world scene.
The skeptics were mistaken in 2012, and they would be proved wrong about Hitrow.
There are always obstacles that need to be overcome, but Hitrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Olympic Games, Hitrow is an infrastructure project for most, not just for a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have an excellent team in Hetrow, which has implemented Pound11 billion of infrastructure investments in time and within the budget, ranging from T5, the best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to T2, built in the middle of two of the world's most busy airstrips.
They are now ready to provide a third airstrip, confirmed by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London have been a great success for Britain, and I'm sure the expansion of Hitrow will be.
It is time for us to turn the Olympic spirit into the right direction and expand Hitrow by providing our trade future and creating the legacy of skills and employment that Britain can proudly take.
Lord Paul Dayton, President of the Council of Hethrou and former Trade Attaché Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays cats on ad blocking
For companies that earn money on the Internet advertisements, attempts to circumvent advertising software are a game of cats, according to a company that creates such software.
On Thursday, literally a couple of days after Facebook announced that he was going to block advertisers on his desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the bulk around its ads to make the advertisers more difficult to recognize what parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now says he was able to pass the new code.
In his blog publication, Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "the kind of mutual struggle between the community of blasters with open source code and those trying to circumvent it has continued since the invention of advertising blocks," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own decision in the near future.
The fact that the world ' s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of the major problem of commercial blocking.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use advertising blockers, according to past year's study Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times the number of users using such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users entering Facebook through mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 per cent of Facebook revenues from advertising.
However, the company is hunting advertising blockers for a desktop version, as mobile ads lockers are ineffective in Facebook mobile applications for social network and the Instagram, according to the representative.
Yet, the advertising in the desktop is a pretty profitable article to make Facebook feel that it's a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that he was going to update his “preferences” tool to give people more control over how advertising is on them.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were a cause for concern, as they would also block some inequitable content on the website.
"It's not going to be a positive experience for people, and we're going to solve this problem," said the representative of Facebook in an official e-mail.
Advertising blockers are a rude tool, so instead we focused on building tools like advertising preferences to transfer governance to people.
A woman moved to a Swiss highway in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after the woman had moved several vehicles on the road early in the morning on Thursday in a clear attempt to commit suicide.
The incident occurred at A1 near Morge in the canton of Woon immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman went in the dark with a gesture of desperation and was hit by several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
The victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, clearly attempted to kill herself struck several vehicles, including the truck.
She died in place.
Some of the involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, the police have reported that they are called upon and anyone else who has witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case, a “logical” step in this situation, stated attorney Gile Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it is still to be determined whether any of the drivers involved would be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the blow?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine," said Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case — both of which involve a person walking in a dark road in the middle of the night — was sentenced that motorists could not expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death on an unwary basis after she hit and killed the man lying on A1 at Payern in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim was drinking and losing consciousness on the road, hearing the court.
The Court found that a police woman who responded to an emergency challenge had managed the vehicle in a justified way and that the presence of a person on the road was “perfectly exclusive and unpredictable”, the judge stated.
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morge must call police for 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus once lived
Venus may have been alive once, according to NASA's new climate model estimates.
Researchers from the NSW Institute for Space Research of Goddard developed a model for a study of the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether it could be in Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and an atmosphere that has been refilled by carbon dioxide, ever existed, such as the earth.
Scientists had previously assumed that a small velocity of Venus was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modelling suggests that Venus could probably have had a diverse atmosphere like the Earth and still rotate slowly.
The model also reviewed the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more dry regions on the planet than on Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent thicker.
" According to GISS model, Venus's slow rotating gives the sun almost two months per day,” explained a GISS scientist from Anthony Del Henio.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds that operates as a umbrella that protects the surface of the planet from a substantial portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is the average climate temperature, which is surprisingly a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously envisaged by planet researchers.
Although Venus may have been alive for several billion years, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans have evaporated and her water pairs have been burned out by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flyed, only the density of the carbon dioxide with the deadly greenhouse effect was left, that is, Venus, which we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy's leaving the Avalanche team coach.
Patrick Roy left the coach and Vice-President of Hokque on Thursday, referring to the lack of influence during the team decision-making process.
Joe Sakik, Executive Vice President / Chief Chief of the Colorado team, confirmed the news and noticed that the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have been the chief coach and vice president of Colorado Avalanche's Hokque with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I have long and diligently thought about how I could improve this team to give it the depth needed and to raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and Vice-President of Hokkey should perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions have not been met for the time being.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakik.
We appreciate what he has done for our organization, and we wish it success in the future.
Roy became a winner of Jack Adams Award as the best facilitator of the League during his first season with Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and the victory in Central Division, but Colorado was crushed by Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and lost the play-offs in the last two years.
Avalanche announced an assessment of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and a five-point retreat from the Wild team in the struggle for the second concessional trip to the Western Conference.
A gatekeeper from the Hall of Slavs, Roy won four Stanley Cups — two from Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
North Sea oils resume negotiations and suspend strikes
Work strikes on oil wages in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parties to the debate are beginning a new round of negotiations, and the leading representatives of the parties have reported.
The bargaining against the Wood Group oil service company was organized sporadically on platforms in the North Sea under the Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unions Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes”, says a joint statement.
We will hold several full-time meetings for the next few weeks from the beginning of the next week to look at the problems with fresh eyesight.
Trade unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, had been directed against potential reductions to up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group reduced the rates paid to North Sea contractors this year by about 9 per cent due to the negative market tensions.
The reduction in the company ' s rates resulted after a 10 per cent reduction in the rates for banking contractors in 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions would provide it with the space necessary to overcome the market decline.
The Shell company, for its part, reduced thousands of people and announced plans to end oil-gasing activities in countries by up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-plain with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower prices of unclean oil: the economic situation has deteriorated as a result of the decision to withdraw from the European Union in June of Britain.
Scottish member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts that arose in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for most, not just for some," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of new projects in the North Sea are expected in 2016, compared with the average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the stars in the Pleiyad.
The latest space telescope mission, Kepler, helped astronomers to assemble the fullest catalogue of the speeds of the Pleiading Scope.
New data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the accumulation rotate with different speeds, as well as how the rotation periods relate to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” explained Louise Riball, a researcher at the Centre for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The digging of Pleiad is from the Earth in 445 light years.
Many stars in the accumulation are now mature; they are born some 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as they'll never be again.
At their peak speeds, these adult stars throw large amounts of star winds out.
By traveling through the magnetic margins of the stars, these winds act as a braking force on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of each star by tracking the time between the detected star spots, such as the sunlight.
The newest speed catalogue suggests that more massive stars are rotating slower than smaller stars.
Riballe compares the stars to the dancers: the larger make the pyruettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "bale" of Pleiad, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster usually refer to very light stars," said Riballe.
Since the Pleiading is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to compare the properties of the stars with the speeds of rotation.
"The Star Scope of Pleiada provides a starting point for theoretical models of star rotation, both younger and older," said Riballe.
We still want to know a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their speed and hang their dance shoes for the nail, figuratively.
Riballe and her colleagues detailed their last analysis of the speed of the Pleiad's turn in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Inquiry into the activity of a group of detainees in Kruma of Ukrainian diversants is conducted by two departments, writes “Commersant”.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of the diversions in Krum.
As previously reported, the resident of the Ukrainian city, Energodar Eugenius Panov, accepted cooperation with the investigation.
He said that as objects for diversia, he viewed the Titan chimadol in Armenian, the petroleum in Theodosia, the Kerchen ferry, the gas pipeline, and one of the military airfields.
The law enforcement authorities believe that not all diversant shareholders have been able to detain.
This has, inter alia, led to the arrest of suspects in the Kiev Rajouse of Simferopol, notes the publication.
Stanislav Churches was the chief soccer trainer in Russia.
At the meeting of the Executive of the Russian Soccer Union, it was decided to appoint the Chief Fellow of Russia for Stanislav Churches.
It will be contracted for two years, until the end of PM-2018.
On 11 August, RFC appointed Russia ' s main coach for Stanislav Churches' football.
It is a famous soccer player who had previously played the Spartak in Moscow at the gateway, as well as a coach with good experience, who was the tutor of Russian teams such as the same Spartacus, Gemzjena-Sochi, Terek, Amcar, Dinama, and the варshaw Legia, which became the winner of the national primacy and the cube of the country.
It is reported that the Chechesov contract will be signed as soon as possible and will be for two years.
It was his responsibility to prepare a 2018 world championship.
It is known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov, will enter his coach headquarters.
There is information that the salary of the entire coach headquarters will amount to Euro2.6 billion a year.
According to the media, the management of the RFS has set before Stanislav Churches the goal of bringing the assembly of Russia to semifinal and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and intends to give footballers the opportunity to show himself.
Also, according to Churchesov, he is glad that his choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Chercezov is to be held by the Russian assembly in Antal on August 31, which will be a joint meeting with the Turkish team.
Remember, earlier Leonid Slutsky was the chief Russian soccer soccer coacher who was combining him with coaching at the CSCA club.
He announced his departure from the Russian National Command on Euro-2016 in France after a long-standing statement.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the bad results of his self-reliance.
Closed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered severe damage during the long fight against apartheid.
However, since independence from South Africa in 1990, the country with a population of 2.4 million has made tremendous progress, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries are perceived to be the self-reasonable free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, in secondary and even primary schools, education is required.
Moreover, Governments are often encouraged to introduce a fee for “reimbursement”.
In Namibia, however, primary school education is free of charge.
Moreover, secondary education has become free since 2015.
The authorities are also active in other important areas.
Malaria eradication efforts have reduced the number of annual cases of disease by 97 per cent over the past 10 years.
Contrary to the international trend of growth in inequality, Namibia is declining.
Geni, the standard income inequality ratio, dropped by 15 points compared with 1993.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty rate declined from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (over 1.90 per day) has also decreased from nearly 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest rating of freedom of speech in Africa, according to “Reporters Without Borders”.
The United States and other rich States were far ahead of the country.
In addition, the country has a favourable rating, one of the highest in Africa, in the Corruption Index, which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when raw materials prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, debt ratios to GDP are about 25 per cent, representing less than 1/3 debt levels in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
Unemployment rates, at least in traditional evaluation methods, remain fairly high, almost 28 per cent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS, almost 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is one of the middle-income countries, but the authorities insist that their State is actually a developing country.
Namibia, of course, faces some of the challenges that have been faced by the underdeveloped economies.
The State has to develop a very large and dry country with a small population.
In the country, the deserts live in isolated nomadic hunter tribes, which must be integrated into a modern society without losing their identity.
Integration of people who were a quarter of a century ago on the periphery of the world economy was not easy for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think of letting go, and the country was dealing with the challenges facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities were engaged in the establishment of a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have gathered together to work for the common good.
In fact, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbours.
About 15-20 per cent of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is referring to the construction of a wall that separates the country from poor and corrupt neighbours.
The Namibians realized that neighbours were not chosen and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate to share scarce water resources, to participate in regional health projects, to encourage investments and to exchange students.
In addition, the Namibian Government has rightly judged that rich natural resources can easily be cursed, contributing to the enrichment of a few by many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's natural wealth must be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also realize that it would not be irresponsible to seek maximum profits from the sale of the country's resources, and review investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency was crucial to this process, so the Government's strong support for freedom of speech was so important.
As the Head of State of Hague Gaingobe noted, the media often say something he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect the freedoms it had received, he said.
Not all key resources of Namibia are exhausted.
Some, such as fisheries, are renewable, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that are beginning with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequality and underdevelopment — can be on the way to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserved international recognition and imitation.
Many heard of the Varna Gold, the oldest golden objects created by man (4600 - 4200 B.C.E.).
It was probably the worst archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, in the excavations of the Varenne Necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts was found, more than 3,000 total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only a single burial known as “Kogel No. 43” has 990 gold items been extracted with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold could soon become a archaeologist’s archaeological bush in July.
Again, in Bulgaria, the pre-historical settlement known as Tel Unacitu.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Unacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Unacitu of the Pazarjik district.
The boucin is a gold strip thrown into the ring.
Javor Boyagjayev, the head of the Telle Unaccitus excavation, dated 4600 before our Common Era and stated that she was older than the Gold of Warna for at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna are dated about the same period, from 4600 to 4200 before our Common Era.
There are no technologies to date metal with sound accuracy.
How, then, can we be sure of what gold is more ancient?
Obviously, Professor Bojajiev knows more than he told Reuters, "I'm absolutely sure the gold of Unacitu is older than the gold of Warna."
It is an indispensable discovery: it is a small subject, but it is large enough to take a suitable place in history.
In an interview, Reuters Boyagius reported that scientists would soon analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re and more thoroughly explore the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bassin with as much accuracy as possible.
The place of discovery also explains much.
Tel Junacié is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Tel Yunaccié is now considered the oldest city in Europe.
Tel was founded by the descendants of the people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (now Turkey) in the 7th millennium before our Common Era.
The processing of metals, from the first metallurgical skills to the establishment of a fully developed industry, has been turbulent in the region over the years.
In the domestic history of this archaeological community, the Balkano Carpathian Metalurgical Province is a special name.
In the 5,000 ’ s before our era, the metal processing centers began to develop urban settlements.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tel Junacitu may be the oldest one, because it was found there in 4,900 B.C.E.
I would call Tel Junacyte the prototype of a modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is older than Shumer for a thousand years," says Boyagyev, in view of the generally accepted view that urban culture was born in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
The first cities were created in a common understanding of that word.
The telescopes of Unacyte have been carried out since 1976.
During that time, archaeologists dug almost 12 hectares, about one third of the projected total settlement area.
Residues of the fortress wall were found, which had once reached three metres high.
While little remains from houses and workshops, archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban hard buildings, business centers and residential areas.
Tel Unacité is often called "Bird City," where dozens of clay bird pieces have been found.
All the birds are pictured in a state of rest, and it is assumed that they were not decorative objects but the object of local worship.
The Bird City was destroyed about 4100 before our Common Era -- maybe by the Indo-European tribes coming from the north-east.
The nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
The three-metre fortification walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have discovered obvious signs of brutal massacres: the remains of old men, women and children were found inside the houses, with traces of wounds inflicted by axes of war.
New discoveries and new facts appear annually, changing the usual vision of the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking about the “lost ” first civilization of Europe in the Balkans.
The gold of Varna, found relatively recently in 1972, has been a powerful incentive in the search for this civilization.
It's logical that Varna's gold luxury was supposed to be preceded by something like a tiny golden bumpkin created in Unacitu Tell.
Porsche artificially aged 911 Targa model
It has been officially stated that 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being trained by manual specialists of the units working with serial machines.
Retro-hucus is, for example, the special color of Etna Blue body, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, even the logo of the model.
In addition, the raffle has received a firm white graph along the boards and special 20-inch Wheeled RS Spyder disks, as well as some parts of the design of the body in white-gold metal.
In the interior of the retro plates, it is markedly smaller: it differs, by large account, from gamma gamma, new chairs with extended electrical regulators and separated by black anodated steel poрогs with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when purchased with a special version, each buyer would receive a chechool gift for the car and a richly separated album with photographs of the production process.
The power plant of Porsche Exclusive experts has not been affected: the retro-targy is quite similar to the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder motor with a turbonadum of 3.0 litres developing 420 litres and 500 Nm.
The dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can speed up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released with a limited circulation, but neither its volume nor the value of each particular sportsman is reported.
Facebook and advertising blockers unpacked the arms race.
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the concealment of ads on social pages has prompted decision makers to block advertising for retaliation.
AdBlock Plus released an anti-drug, but Facebook is planning to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus predicted her new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Societies noted that in trying to deceive the new “unlocked” advertising technology, AdBlock Plus, together with commercial announcements, blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
In Facebook, they regretted this AdBlock Plus policy and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source among Societies developers told TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready for the next hours.
Societies and lockers have thus unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to win each other, while the affected party has become users who have missed interesting notes from friends or who have seen advertising where they are not used to see her.
The ethical aspects of advertising blocking have recently caused hot disputes.
In Murmansk, the rapist will be brought to court · Tonight's Murmansk.
His case had already been completed in the Russian Federation Investigative Committee on the Murman Field.
The prosecution for a 54-year-old man is very serious - sexual violence.
It has been determined that, at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Paul's street in Murmansk committed sexual acts of violence against the 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for substantive consideration.
The authorization of the article provides for the maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring Krosswen Fengguang to Russia 370 and Peak Rich New - Web site www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular car class in China, combining the merits of the minivan and crossover.
Another stated Russian premiere is Pickap Rich New.
Many Western firms of the Moscow International Automobile decided to ignore this year, so the vacuum of the Crocus Expo exhibits would be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a strong front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large types on the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting news to our roadblocks in the near future.
One of them will be Crosswen Dongfeng Fengguang, who sold in China this spring price of 55,900 Yuan (seven less than 550,000 roubles of current course).
The Russians are unlikely to have such a price, and the question of shipments to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang was able to reach the 11th site of the list of the most sold minewins, although, in view of the high traffic light (175 mm) and the lower perimeter plastic cover, it could be attributed to crossovers.
Krosswen is built on the Fengguang model junior front-wing platform of 360, in the 370th of the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (465 mm versus 4510 mm), the design is stronger and the equipment is richer.
The salon is painted with wooden plates, but the large vertical sensor screen "as at Tesla" on the central convoy was only on the early exhibition copies of Krossven, and the cars with "music" were easily sold.
Five of the seven landing sites are easily folded, forming a 1650 mm loading area, the maximum volume of the trunk is 1,500 litres.
The engine for Fengguang 370 provides only one - 1.5-litre petrol "atmospheric" power 115 litres compressed with a 5-step mechanical gearbox.
The manufacturer modestly silent on the dynamic quality of the machine, but promises that the appetite owner ' s saving budget is 6.7 litres/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the last generation, but with a little enclosed Chinese styles.
Despite the morally obsolete design, the model still enjoys a stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unwilling “work horse”.
At a similar price, Rich New is likely to be interested in Russians, because the modern Japanese peaks have become undimensionally expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two elective engines: petrol 2.4 litres (137 litres) or turbodysel 2.5 litres (116 litres).
The gearbox is only a mechanic, the drive to the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigid "front".
At the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship Sedan A9, his Russian Prime Office of the Chinese firm announced in June.
Minveolike crossvers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, some of the latest news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Dongfeng Russian liner consists of two models: S30 and Hatchbek H30 Cross.
Within seven months of this year, the Chinese firm’s dealers carried 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notifications will cease to be sent by mail - Web site www.zr.ru
Tax inspection has changed the way in which property tax notifications have been sent.
All Russian car owners have been used to a scheme that has not changed for years: in summer and autumn they receive by mail a receipt of a previous year ' s transport tax.
However, many will not wait this year.
The case is that the tax inspection has changed the order of notification of citizens.
Those who are registered at the Office of the Taxpayer on the official website of the department of nalog.ru will receive notices electronically.
In the inspection, they automatically considered these Russians as online users and cut them out of standard, paper.
The novelty affects all owners of vehicles and real estate.
All others will continue to receive usual letters.
On the other hand, the possibility of returning to the old scheme is also available to the account holders on the website.
In order to do so, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notice will appear in the "Private Cabinet" immediately after writing, while the letter will go a few days and may be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Tax Inspectorate internet has overturned for 18 million people, allowing the department to save seriously on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not sufficient to inform citizens of the changing order.
Some could register at the “Personal Cabinet” for one-time services and have forgotten it.
These people will not wait for messages by mail, and they will fall into the category of non-payers with all the consequences.
Access to the “Link Tax Payer Cabinet” is provided in three ways: through the recording of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature, or by entering the log and password specified in the registration map.
The latter can be obtained in person in any tax inspection office (depending on the place of accounting).
We recall that this year the transport tax needs to be paid until 1 December.
The sending of notifications started in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve very high returns, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not embarrass the masters of the G-Power company who began to modify Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for her addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to her masters is strange.
In fact, why not improve G 63-571-mighty aerodynamic carbon and run up to a hundred for 5.4 s?
The "music" of the crazy "helika", the masters took advantage of the advantages that the 5.5-litre superfluous "seven."
And then the flux of the race has improved to a hundred for the indifferent 0.1 s, and now the flying "kyrpic" is capable of leaping for 5.3 s.
On the other hand, acceleration from medium speeds is likely to be much better for it.
The speed ceiling frightens: if standard G 63 is not travelling faster than 210 km/h, the tuning all-road with the deactivated electronic "wheeler" can reach 250 km/h.
Outside, the vehicle is almost incompatible with its factory source, except for other wheel disks - 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Luxembourg unit announced an impressive conceptual bulk of 6 m long, which will be presented in the Pebble Beach Conference.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "Green Sub-Bend" of BMW i and move its electrical models under a separate trade mark.
In the coming years, at least four environmental innovations are expected to emerge.
