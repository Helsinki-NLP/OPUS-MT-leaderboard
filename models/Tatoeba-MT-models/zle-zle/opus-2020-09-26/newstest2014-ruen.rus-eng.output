Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and the district
Earlier, one of the hangings had done a suicide attempt.
On 30 October, about 1 to 00, in the village of Lugova, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to do that is unknown.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, a 41-year-old man living in Kineshma killed his life.
No forcible deaths have been found, reports the IMS press service “Kinhemian”.
Do you have a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the scattered road system, many are beginning to see a solution in a little black box carefully fitted on your car’s instrumental panel.
These devices, which track each mile pass and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the old American motorway financing system, which is being implemented by the planners of Washington and the State.
The typically boring arena of motorway planning has suddenly caused intensive debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians joined the environmental groups in lobbying the Government ' s right to use small barleys to track the number of miles you pass and perhaps even where you pass them, and then to use that information in the formation of tax accounts.
The teashire movement is shocking.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about private life.
Although the congress is not yet in a position to agree, to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They think about how the next decade can move to a system where drivers pay for each mile of the road they pass.
Thousands of motor vehicles have already taken these black boxes to test, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not the question on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Iirata, Executive Director of the Association of Government of Southern California, who is preparing plans to start tracking by the state of the miles passed by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that already.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the Construction of Highways, financed by the Tax Account that Americans pay on autofills.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes by even one cent at high petrol prices.
“The gasoline tax cannot be retained, ” said Le Mannić, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on the vehicles to test the fee system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
It's called a petty user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce the loading of roads and greenhouse gases, for example.
The planning bodies in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to achieve the targets established by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free marketers in Reason are also thrilled to make drivers pay for each mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs.
People pay directly for what they're getting.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called on the Congress to move in the direction of parole.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, which would involve about 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
A number of states and cities, however, are on their own.
The most enthusiastic is in Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are being recruited for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay to the state for miles of run instead of taxing gasoline.
In Nevada, the pilot project has been completed.
In New York, it is under consideration.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the Coalition I-95, which includes transport departments of 17 states of the eastern coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), explores how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track each step.
“The concern over the “great brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alauddine Khan, leader of the strategy and efficiency management of the Nevada Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were in progress, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It is not difficult to make these devices fully monitored”.
There is no need to create a huge, grim technology infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to store daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there are difficult searches for low-cost technologies that would allow state authorities to keep track of car miles but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company did not assist in the collection of State taxes.
It sought to reach the developing market of the type of road insurance where drivers were paid on the basis of a run.
But the devices she tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited number of information that is periodically downloaded by a modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this unless you track their speed and do not track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
Some major mistakes were made in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are much less expensive and less obsessional ways to do so.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with different options for drivers.
They can select a device from or without GPS.
Or they may completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee on the basis of the average number of miles travelling by all state residents.
In other places, the idea of a cautious public is expected to be sold, making the devices do more and not less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a taxing device that will also receive payment for parking counters, provide “payments as you ride” insurance and collect real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid failure.
“Attomobilists will engage in the benefit they will be offered,” says the city design document.
Some designers of transport systems, however, are wondering whether all talking about parcel pay is just a huge distraction.
At the City Transport Commission in the Gulf of San Francisco, officials say that the Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Highways by taxing petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid vehicles and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when everything you need to do is to accept aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their private life and many other things.
The EU is preparing support to Ukraine in the case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide Ukrainian gas as well as an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are under way with the IMF on a standby loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can obtain Euro610 million from the EU itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuter doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences about funding conditions.
There is no belief in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating to one degree on Friday, to “B-” from “B”.
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve for Ukrainian gas, the majority of which is now from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be a gas from the "North Flow" or a reversal from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way for Russia to “isolate” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and it is likely that supply to other regions will be reduced.
“The EU and Ukrainian countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” added Reuter's source.
Russia out of the pollution of car cities
Efforts have been made to address the transport problems of major cities in most of the world's megapolis since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a general rule, it was either to restructure and expand roadways or to try to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of vehicles and the time they were used.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where there is strict quotas for the growth of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased in auctions.
Its price can double to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have entered the city centre fee.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced to allow entry only to certain eco-lasses using high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environment Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
As reported by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Beijing Le Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increases in private cars to not more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and increases by no more than 5 per cent of the fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme is the limitation on the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes for owners.
Among other things, the urban green five-year-old measures include accelerated transition to euro-standard fuels, the introduction of local eco-standards and vehicle and fuel labelling, the restrictions on the entry of vehicles to the central part of the city, the prohibition on obsolete vehicles (except for the introduction of incentives for the replacement of old vehicles to hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public and service), public transport (including high-speed).
Pekina ' s autonomy also includes a ban on all private cars within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the CPD of their six) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the vehicle plate) and the issuance of registration marks for lottery-based vehicles (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for private car registration in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state programme for the Environment 2012-2020, the number of high and very high air pollution cities should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Minnature, in 2011, “movable sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all pollutants in the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial and in St. Petersburg are nine times.
In the RF, the possibility of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities is still under consideration.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the WSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at quenching the demand for road travel are well known to be unpopular, can only be adopted by society on the basis of their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where two clusters are weakly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, as well as “privileged” users whose total number is at least 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total Moscow vehicle fleet).
During the days of urbanists from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared that analysed the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and traffic.
The main findings of researchers: the city centre is provided by roads twice as low as required, and most of the centre vehicles do not use cars every day, leaving them for long periods of time on parking or on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build, not parking, but motor vehicle storage, rather than to expand the roadway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians), and to limit the use and placement of personal transport at the borders of the Zone of the historic centre (the total area of about 3212 ha covering a number of central areas of the city).
Warfares for unauthorized street trade in Volgoda will grow once more
Urban authorities believe that an increase in fines will help to establish order in Vodé and free streets from natural tents and lots.
Most street dealers do not pay taxes, the products they implement are often not subject to related sanitary control.
This means that wetness is threatened.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, reports the Voloda Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned about the risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a non-payment crisis on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in employees.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it's completely driven by consumption, which is almost unreduced”, said the chief economist, Goldman Sachs, in Russia, Clemens Graffe, presenting yesterday a quarterly report on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal wage increase in Russia is about 10%.
In inflation, 6 per cent will be able to provide future consumer demand at approximately the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
But the cost-effectiveness of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to be optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the wage rate in GDP: if the wages increase by 10%, GDP only by 2%, explained Mr. Graphe.
Companies have experienced a decline in cost-effectiveness.
If she does not grow up, this can lead to dismissal and increased unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise wages, comments the chief economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure the employees or to keep the current, employers have to raise their wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid increase in demand.
Mr. Graphe said that because of the extremely high consumer borrowing rates, that kind of lending did not affect the economy.
"We didn't see any benefits for the economy from demand growth, money doesn't go to the economy, but return to the same banks as interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs expects to increase the delay on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by the poor, who have nothing to provide.
Interest for such loans is high.
As a result, they are not returned more frequently," said Mr. Graphe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is the possible non-payment crisis on unsecured credits.
The Director of the Banking Institute of VSHE Vasili Slavkov has already seen signs of the emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the cheap resources available to the public, were forced to attract the population at high interest rates.
In response, the State party went to the war tremors and began to reduce credit rates, and the economist continues to do so.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans under the same interest rates, otherwise they will have negative interest margins.
If the State party does not give up on the dumping, Russia threatens a full banking crisis, believes Vasili Sweetkov.
The deprivation of licences from a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers it to be a predictor of the mass collapse.
“The state will not handle this situation: the investment insurance system has not originally been designed for a systemic crisis,” warns the head of the institute.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, believed in an investment bank, due to the refusal to index the salaries of the public servants and the military, as set out in the current budget version.
In part, the consumption impact will be reduced by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and as a result, the decline in inflation).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisite is not yet available - see the report), the growth of consumption will still slow down, assured by Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantuchin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisite for pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in oil prices," he says.
He estimated that Russia ' s economy would start to decline at oil value below $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CBC is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxical picture is that inflation has fallen and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they didn't believe the CB that announced a transition to inflationary tarding," said Clemens Graff.
The Central Bank policy on market rates does not affect, and only affects inter-bank credit rates.
"For the CB, it's a collapse of all hopes," I appreciated Clemens Graphe.
CB auction money is used by banks not to lend the economy but to manage their liquidity
Once the rate is reduced, the exchange rate is changing immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the rouble.
“Rano or later the CB will realize that this strategy is not working,” said Mr. Graphe and recalled that the State is planning to launch a rouble in the “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But you'll have to do it before, or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
He estimated that the rouble was now artificially high by 10 per cent.
Only one road is weakened, the expert concludes.
But if the CB shrinks at least the shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not a part of the rouble reduction policy, it can break the rod much harder.
The two South Ural peoples' congress was held in Chalbinsk.
The Forum is tied to the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the Reconstruction of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegates from all cities and areas, national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive branches attended the congress, a total of about 350 people.
The course of the Forum is aimed at strengthening the international agreement.
We can show examples not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We don't have differences.
We live in full understanding," says Theophan, Mitropolitan Chalbinski and Zlatoustowsky.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including patriotism, cultural cooperation.
Following the convention, a resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
The national cultural associations of the Chalbin region have been opened here.
Snowen is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the question of United States exploration
Edward Snowen, the explorator of the United States intelligence, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director, Kit Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met on Thursday with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowen, which the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, he said: “While the results of my efforts were obviously positive, my Government continues to view disparity as a change and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
The truth, however, is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include spying and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, informed Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowen is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible”.
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to the Chancellor Angeles Mercel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy headed by a parliamentary unit responsible for intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowen as a witness, “not endangering him or destroying his relations with the United States in whole”, it should be used.
Mr. Strebele, parliamentary deputy from the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strobele said that Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be “safety” there, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had faced a violent and permanent campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his house.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high - ranking officials, including the United States, have found the uncontrolled system to be of value to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of the humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge the handcuff
Frontier Airlines plans to take off passengers up to $100 for carrying a hand-to-distance on board their flight.
The frontier Airlines plans to start taking up $100 for the manual warehouse and $2 for coffee or gases, although their announcement on Wednesday was that passengers would be able to keep the whole bank.
The new hand warehouse fees are covered by bags in the upper bags, so small bags placed under the seat will be free of charge.
The frontier said it would charge $25 if the charge was paid in advance, and $100 if the travelers were to pay, only when they left the landing.
The Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee should make the passengers pay in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it, ” she said.
Airlines began to charge the first and second bags delivered in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges have as much as they can, in a hand store placed in the upper baggage compartments, often lacking space in these compartments.
Gathering is one way to force passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really for money.
The fact is that the most loyal clients of the Frontier claim that finding a place in the upper baggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not be paid.
This means that one passenger on the flight queue may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and at the frontier's rods was meant to guarantee that passengers would know about collecting before they got to land.
The new frontier collection for the hand warehouse will not begin to be charged until summer, although the date is not yet established.
Passengers often complain of luggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that luggage processing is worth money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many in the Wall Street view the addition of luggage as a sign that airlines charge enough to cover the costs of flights after several years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not relate to hand warehouse fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first charge for the handcuff three years ago, and another dispatcher Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with this fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says Jay Sorensen Air consultant, who closely monitors supplementary charges.
According to his estimate, in the December 2011 report, the hand warehouse fees offer Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew by Spirit's flight, and he was wondering what he would find out by going to land when the passengers encounter an unusual gathering of Spirit for the handcuff.
“The landing process was the smoothest of what I saw for my career in airlines, ” he said.
I was hoping to see the dental shining of my teeth and the fraying out of the landing.
The plane was captured, he said, "and the landing went fast."
The frontier also follows the Spirit with respect to the payment of $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
The frontier stated that passengers who receive gases or juice could leave the entire bank and that the coffee share would be provided free of charge.
She's still going to be giving water free.
US Airways tried shortly to pay for the drink in 2008 but refused it seven months after the passengers complained and no other large airlines followed her example.
The Frontier ' s Manual Loan Purchase Initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last measure to attract customers to their website.
Airlines pay online salesmen, like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than tourist online agent.
The Frontier, however, went further in this area.
In September, she began to give twice as few as bonus miles of often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the prize number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of travel.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip from the Frontier from an online tourist agency would be able to reach 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only choose a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is going down and getting lost.
The benefit decreased by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the Parents Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to refurbish the border finances as part of the sale of airlines.
ANB blames “inner error” rather than hackers for ending the site
The Secret Agency for National Security announced on Friday evening that the termination of their site for hours had caused a technical failure, not hackers, as reported on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planned update,” reported the intelligence agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that a breakthrough was caused by a distributed attack like “reject in service” [DDoS] are incorrect.
Previous tonight, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA site did not work at least six hours, and the site was still unavailable for some users.
Previously, the representative of the ABC News informed ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency “not” had been hacked.
No secret information is at risk, the representative reported.
At least one hacker activist online group stated that it was responsible for withdrawing from the DDoS site.
DDoS-attacks are designed to overtake the target site by traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site exits.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super secret NSA, once known as “No such Agency”, has found itself in recent months at the centre of public attention and intense criticism following the revelations of its extensive foreign and domestic surveillance programmes, all of which are reactions to the secret ANC files stolen from the agency and published by a disappointed former staff member ABB Edward Snoud.
The growing debate around the agency has prompted the fact that the current incident was the result of targeted hackers ' actions.
Bombardier ' s arrival decreases as the shipments fall and the number of orders ordered on aircraft
The Bombardier Corporation, Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday as a result of the reduced number of orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway unit.
Bombardier ' s company in Montreal has also not published any data on the aircraft ' s latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether an ambitious plans for the commercial operation of the aircraft will be implemented for the next September.
After the first flight of the pilot aircraft, which took place about one and a half months ago, it only flyed three times, raising questions as to whether the graphing phase was taking place.
The results did not justify projections and led to a fall of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Fund Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, National Bank Finance analyst, reduced on Thursday its assessment from “higher average market” to “medium” because of the belief that the increase in shares is limited in the nearest quarter or two.
“While reducing the number of airships was generally predictable, we are undoubtedly disappointed by the arrivals of the transport division,” said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will get new CSeries orders as the summer test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will be more skeptical.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries Families will allow her to gain a place in the bottom price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first test sample of the aircraft was submitted in March and flyed for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not yet too many — 177 because potential buyers are waiting for summer test results to test the company ' s fuel efficiency and potential cost of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Bodouan, was confident that Bombardier would achieve its target in 300 solid orders at the time the first aircraft would be launched in commercial exploitation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward.
“The test model of the aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” said Bodouan during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software upgrades were planned for the time of a simple aircraft.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break to update, so we did.
This will take place throughout the summer test programme.
The second of the five test samples should fly in the coming weeks, and all the others would soon follow him as reported by the company.
Still, analysts skeptically refer to the claim that the first client would be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the deadline for operationalization and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of summer tests, although apparently consistent with the Bombardier internal schedule, supports our view that the introduction to operation will be carried over to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, ending on 30 September, the net income of Bombardier declined to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted share gains remained nine cents.
Gross income decreased slightly — from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents for share and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had placed 45 aircraft over a quarter, which was less than the previous year 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The Aviation Division order portfolio was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, without changing since 31 December.
“In the aerospace area, the results were in line with our objectives, but the small number of orders received and the general market conditions have become a negative factor,” said Bodouan.
Gross revenue from aviation has fallen by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, reported that gross income in this sector rose by almost 11 per cent — to $2.1 billion.
The purchase portfolio in the transport unit was 3.2.6 billion as at 30 September, a little higher than the 31 December.
The income of the transport unit has had a negative impact on the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that the principal financial director of Google Patrick Pechatt would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent — to $4.83 in the middle of Thursday bidding.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer in the world and the nearest Bombardier competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits.
The Japanese Electronics Manufacturer, Sony Corporation, completed the past net loss quarter of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the projection of profits over the current financial year.
Sony’s results from July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected as a result of the decline in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers for the Japanese corporation.
Sony's televising business, in the second quarter, brought the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion ions of operational losses during the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is undergoing difficult times, especially because of reduced demand for television.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the complex situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic corporations, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial compendiums: sales of companies are increasing at a high rate, especially through road systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects 179 billion of operational profits against the earlier 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts suggested that the figure would be significantly higher and would be 221 billion yen.
To get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, the sales of “smart” hours were announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would make it possible to get the smartphone out of the pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced the annual income and profit projection projection, the company's shares in the opening of the Tokyo roads in the morning lost more than 11 per cent, down to 1,1668 yen for one share.
The Hen of speech was the synaptic education stimulant
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Maunt Sinai Medical School found a protein that enabled Foxp2 to carry out its function by stimulating new neurons linkages.
The study is published in Science, and its summary content is available on the magazine.
Hen Foxp2 is the first known gene, whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had broken the Foxp2 gene, but how it carried out its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of Foxp2 ' s functions are as a stimulator for the development of new synapses in the brain related to the formation of speech.
That's what he does because of another gene, SSRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the education of the synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vaccination has been confirmed by scientists in the experiment on muscular.
When the animal's gene activity was artificially reduced, they were less screaming when they were separated from their mother.
If the gene's activity was restored, the frequency of the sounds was restored.
Previously, there was also a connection on the mouse with the focalization of Foxp2.
Animals that were introduced by a human copy of the gene were more active and at a lower rate than the usual mouse.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 is linked to the work of SSRPX2 and, accordingly, to the purely “mechanical” properties of the education of sounds or to more subtle processes.
Lawyer with cocaine dependence, who warned the chief of the criminal faction about police investigation, was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta conveyed information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarborro
Counsel feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta provided criminal authority to Nile Scarborro secret information on the investigation of drug trafficking after being threatened by its cocaine dependency.
A lawyer named Bash and called “curt lawyer” was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police tracking operation for Scarborro, which he had previously represented at a drug-related trial.
The officers observed that 32-year-old Scarbororor had left three cocaine packets at the lawyer's home in Blackburn County of Lankashire while he was at the dinner of a jurist association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” class A drug, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
During the eight months of January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information on the arrests of two persons on instructions from Scarborro, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were monitored by the police at that time as part of a large investigation into the crime organization ' s marketing of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambri, Mercisaide, Burkhir and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, amounting to £1.5 million and more than £200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta communicated information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine dependence would be revealed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, which works at the Forbes Solicitors Legal Company in Blackburn, it has been disgraced by two cases of deliberate impediment to the execution of justice following a three-week trial in the Court of Liverpool of the Crown.
He confessed to the storage of cocaine at a previous trial.
The revelation of a lawyer took place after the police dismantling Scarborro found that he had regularly talked to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives were monitored and found that he came to Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed 60 per cent of drugs in a black glove for golf under the lawyer's garbage boxes.
Shortly after the transfer of Scarbororough, Ditta was called a lot of time at the dinner of the Iwood Stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs, and nine conversations were held.
The Court found out that Ditta “regularly used” cocaine after tests found drug traces of class A in its hair, purse and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said that he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was “advocate”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a sample of hair.
During the police interrogation, he said that he had a house office alongside his workplace, and the clients came to his home in legal matters.
However, the court was aware that after important arrests, he called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented before the court to tell them that they were known by detectives.
In her indictment, Ann White said: “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer”.
Mr. Ditta was accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he had entered into too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would certainly prove to be lawful because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely transcended the normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He obstructed the police investigation to the extent possible to allow these persons to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession but dishonored it.
He was too close to certain customers, in particular Scarbororough, and allowed him to question his uninterested interest.
Ditta did not admit his guilt and stated: “If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not, and would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarboror, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done so without delay.”
After the meeting, however, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashire Police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he begins to acquire drugs from organized crime”.
His cocaine addiction had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the aims of the main criminal groups, who had assigned him valuable information on police investigations.
Counsel should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and impart trust and confidence to society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover himself with his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Ditt led the Lankashire unit on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cocaine cases, and now to impede the exercise of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just penalty for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborón himself was sentenced to 14 years after confessing his guilt in conspiracy for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons involved in fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a discussion in the form of questions and answers, in which he said that the work of his dream was a lawyer representing clients with the death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work was an inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavle was not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, and police officers who attended today ' s CDC meeting.
The ticket programme is, in their view, nearly doubled.
During the 1/16 final Russian Cube with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were employed under the regulatory rate of 9,000.
Spartacic hospitals had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium’s capacity, but, according to the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold.
These data were reported by the head of KDC Arthur Grigorianz.
Americans listened to Japanese high-level officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the U.S. Special Service who chose not to disclose his name stated that the States had listened to the telephone conversations of high-level Japanese officials.
The man confirmed that there were several points in the land of the rising sun to listen.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand did not pursue intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, has reported a telecommunications station NHK, despite alliances with Americans in the post-war period.
No party has formally commented on this information yet.
Remember, the news of the U.S. supervisor's tracking for the FRG Chancellor came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA has been able to listen to Mercelle's phone for the last ten years.
The Chancellor himself, according to some evidence, was very painfully aware of her hearing.
She stated that the allies, in her view, were the FRY and the United States for decades, such monitoring of the head of Government was unacceptable.
In the meantime, Edward Snowen stated that he was ready to share details of the telephone hearing of Angels Mercelle with the German Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Germans made a special visit to Moscow to meet with a former CIA staff member.
Bachelor's can put the grain on the trade not earlier than the beginning of 2014.
Bashkyriya, during public procurement interventions, can present grains for trade not earlier than the beginning of 2014, considers the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nicolas Kovalco.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the Intervention Fund.
While the market price is higher, there is demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put on the market after the New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, crop crop crops under the 2013 crops were 3.1 million hectares, including 1.7 million grains, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
A total of 550,000 ha (per 15,000 hectares higher than in 2012) were planted under the 2014 crop.
The area has been increased under the ozim wheat and tritikale, and the horn remains at the same level.
There is no Brazilian circle in the bases to which Leps was assigned in the United States
In the databases of the Russian militia group "Bracy", which Washington attributed to the singer Grigory Leps, it does not mean.
According to Interfax in the law enforcement agencies of the RF, all databases were verified by the media, but no such groupings were found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian Mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, in force structures.
"In fact, in the very name, "Bracy", there's some element of mystery, there's a hint on a secret bed.
"It's all very like a pyar action," said the agency interviewer.
On 31 October, the U.S. Ministry of Finance announced the inscription on its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Brazilian criminal syndicate of Arthur Badalian, Gregorya Lepsveridze, Wadima Lyalina, Sergei Moscalenko, Jacob of the Ribal and Igor of Shlikov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of having contact with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be influential members of criminal groups and who have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps “will serve as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev.”
At Grigory Leps Produser Center, they refused to comment on US charges against the singer, calling them "tree."
In 2011, President Barak Obama identified the Brazilian Cluster as “existent transnational organized criminal groups” and mandated the minefin to “understand and prevent their global criminal operations”.
The man's black listings of the United States mines entail blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with people living in the United States.
The scandal video went to the police.
Head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly unreasonable outlets, came to smoke Crek.
The Canadian City Police stated that it had a video recording and was ready to initiate an investigation against the city.
He said he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
The information that the authorities have evidence of the use of drugs by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police Web site.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share with the public, but for their existence he was handed over.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during the anti-narcotic raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press had written about this video, but until recently there were no confirmations.
The mayor does not comment on this.
He's just saying that he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to retire.
The police video recording is one of the evidence in the 35-year-old friend Ford Alexander Lisie, who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, gaining illegal income and conspiracy.
At times, Lisie was driver Rob Ford.
The city has long been demanding the resignation of its mayor.
He fought journalists repeatedly, appeared in the public drunkenness, allowed himself to be racist and sexist.
OAO “Rostovaeroinvest” recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the projector.
The amount of the contract in the RadioInvest is not disclosed.
According to the OAO press information, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the contest, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the State Expertis in spring 2014.
A new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport facilities, must be designed.
At the first stage of the construction, the inner area of the terminal would be 50,000 m2, and it could be further increased.
According to RadioInvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
By the time of the outcome of the tender, the architectural concept of the South Aero-Aerocotics complex was established by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal project embodies the idea of an air bridge between the Rostov-na-Dona and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has the experience of major projects, the company has projected terminals C and E “Sheremetiero International Airport” and the new airport at the Knevići International Airport in Vladivostock.
The International South Airport Unit will be built in the Axay area of Rostov and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and integrated in urban construction in the long run.
The launch of the aero-oxygen complex is scheduled for 2014, and the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Policy in Turkey declared starvation against the wall at the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a separation wall in the area of Nusaibin in south-eastern Turkey.
The locals and representatives of the PMD Procurd Party strongly opposed the construction.
The Mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aische Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported to RIA Newsty in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PID) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
The Head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Guler, first challenged the construction, then stated that the wall was built to ensure border security.
"Mar Nusaybina Aische Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The city mayor believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries, and the Kurds crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is a inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree," quote Aisha Hekhan from the party.
According to the press, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nousaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will set the exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, Boliviar, relative to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on 1 November by the Bloomberg Agency, with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela will also allow travellers to sell up to 25 per cent of the batteries acquired in the country at the time of their departure.
The specific rate of Bolivia versus the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devaluate the local currency to 6.3 pains per dollar.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 Bolivians.
Since the beginning of the year, it has lost nearly 70 percent of its value.
In September, Venezuela had almost 50 per cent of inflation.
The Minister of the Petroleum Industry and Vice President of the Economics, Rafael Ramirez, on 18 October, stated that Venezuela had no plans to devaluate pains.
According to the informal information brought by the agency, Karakas could still decide to lower the rate of national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing prices for products and goods of general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a number of deficits and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that Venezuela had a shortage of toilet paper.
Andrey Belmach, Director of South-Rail, noted that it is hard to say how much time it takes to find a new main coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepeleva.
Resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how long you're gonna need to find a new coach, I'm not ready, and I'm saying, "ITAR TASS" Belmacha.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a coach, but a man who's gonna work for a few years at our club and get some results.
Kenyan press is indignant by the media provocative law
“This is a frightening place, and there is reason for the question: What may prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?”
“This law is very severe and punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of Capital Group, a capitalFM parent company, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media court “will always be passive because it is a continuation of the Government”, and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the Government to “repeat the media as a dead strife”, and the Standard stated that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had “had a serious impact” and had criticized the Bill as “draconic”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting surveillance camera records where the troops who were sent to the attack allegedly robbed a expensive trade centre.
Chief of Police, David Kimayo, responded to a challenge to two journalists and the media official for interrogation, although the challenge was lifted after mass protests by the media.
Under the new law, publishings can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists, up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from lists”, that is, banning official journalism accreditation.
The Court is also entitled to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “even more than one fine is sufficient to paralyse the work of most FM Radiolis”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called "живed blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut down, they will be able to do everything they think, without impunity.
“Nobody will ever know, ” wrote Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing the Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balanced forces in public life.
“People themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators have also been a target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the reductions appointed by the National Wages Commission and for the restoration of their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month without taxes, one of the highest in the world.
The utilities charges will provide a new line of expenditure - capital maintenance of the house.
The standard two-room apartment will have to be paid between 100 and 400 roubles per month, according to the most in-depth calculations.
A precise norm will determine the Government of the region.
However, when we paint a ride, order the staircase cells, or even replace the elevator, the residents themselves will decide.
This law has been approved by the provincial deputies.
Vladimir Keynikov, Chairman of the Vorones Provincial Duma, noted: “In this case, it is also necessary to set up orders to set up the orders of the houses, to accumulate funds not in the managers of the companies - which we often have to register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, somewhere else, this will be the establishment of State control over the spending of funds that the residents collect for the repair of the multi-family houses.”
Under the control of the State, the construction of the fees is now under the control of the State.
The law protecting against fraud has been approved by deliberately reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4 5,000 people were affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in the construction of the share.
Vladimir Keynikov, President of the Vorones District Duma, stated: “It is not a secret that abuses have also begun in this area because in the 98th year the same spoilers have been caught, and in the 2000s the same fees.”
People started to earn money to cover up the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronese it is decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The provincial Parliament has passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems of illegal migrants in the region are at least absolved.
For example, in the past year, there were just over 100,000 foreigners on migration records.
But only 1 in 5 issued a formal work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes are a big question.
Vladimir Kennikov, President of the Voronez District Duma, said, "They have violated legislation but are not criminals."
There's no court, but deportation is to be held somewhere.
Such a decision had been made by the Federation that regional funds had made such facilities available.
In the Voronese region, this place is defined as the Old Olshana of the Semiluk region.
Well, then, the regional Parliament has finally granted new benefits to many children's parents.
First, families with 5 or more children are completely free from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million, but the same saves many children.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt the 3rd and more children will grant housing subsidies since the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres at a cost of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people, is father, mother, mother and child and the 3rd, adopted.
For them, according to the normative standards, the State acquires 108 square metres of housing for 3 million,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microwave, it is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the garage center for that amount.
Baumgertner is nominated to the Uralkalia Board of Directors.
The current Council of Directors of the OAO, Uralcalium, has proposed the nomination of a detainee arrested in Minsk by Vladislav Baumgartner to a new composition of the Council, reported on the Russian company ' s website.
Bamugertner was on the list of 11 persons nominated to a new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, in which a new composition of the board of directors would be determined by a vote.
Baumgartner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
When he was detained in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official authority.
Later, however, President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, at a press conference, stated that the charges of Baumgertner were reclassified to “blame”.
Matt Dalton refused to comment on Vladimir Krikunova's withdrawal from his lower-ranking tutorship doctor.
Holkiper believes that Dmitry Balmin, the Acting Principal Coach, has great authority on the players and will cope with their responsibilities.
Remember, today, the Petrochemic resigned Krykunov.
Honestly, I wouldn't like to comment on Vladimir Crickunov's dismissal, quoting Dalton RIA News.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will meet his obligations -- I don't doubt that.
He has great authority on the team, and that young specialist will certainly await a great future.
Leonardo Bonuchchi's Juventus Defense would not help the team at the nearest Italian championship match with the Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coach headquarters decided not to include him in the application for a game to guard against the 4th tour group round of the League of Champions with Real.
Nor will they join the Parma Likhtsteiner, Vunić and Pepe.
And the Fabio Cvalarella's forward was restored after the injury and ready to play.
Fuel travel will result in tax manoeuvres, which would include increased mining tax (FNI) on oil, while lowering export duties and increasing shares.
In the view of experts, these measures could bring additional 619.3 billion roubles into the budget.
The President of the Krasnoyar Court had abducted the certificate by hitting him on the head.

U.S. Secretary: Skills were sometimes too far off in data collection
U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, acknowledged that in the collection of data and auditions, U.S. special services were sometimes “too far”, but the policy agency noted that the media's information on the audition of 70 million people was not valid.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases this went too far and was unjust.
I recognize this, as the President also recognizes... and we will ensure that this has not happened in the future,” quotes the Secretary-General of the AFP.
Italian employees and their seniors have made their way to young people.
Italian unemployment beats record.
Data published on the environment showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population was unemployed.
This has not been the case since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is more than a few times higher.
40.4% of the population aged between 15 and 24 have no employment.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This is already a major energy company in the country, and the laws adopted allow the regional authorities to provide part of the pre-term pension for workers with ages.
On the other hand, Italy is awaiting the common problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And the economists are not sure that the premature rotation of staff will be justified.
What will result in the construction of TPOs in Moscow?
With each year, the capital authorities are promising an increasing number of trans-shipment hubs (TAPs).
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TNCs in construction.
What the project is going on, our correspondent was working on.
A few months ago, a construction fence arose at the Smolenian Railway.
The label stated that a trans-shipment hub was under way.
It was all very strange, because there's no ground transportation near Smolenka, and so you can't move on it.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sad ring, it is necessary to cross some 130 m, including the ground crossing through the Carmanic roadway.
It's almost over with Smolenska.
There was no flowering lare, a newspaper stand dismantled, and the asphalt changed in front of the entrance.
That's the whole transport knot.
Transport and trans-shipment nodes are flat and capital, explaining in the press office of the capital department of transport.
There's no capital tutorials yet.
The planes include parking, the withdrawal of trade facilities that hinder passenger movement, the creation of small architectural shapes and improvement.
In fact, there are even traffickers, not traffickers, but professional mining workers from the Moskwa Capital Reconstruction Department.
The transport knot is not necessarily a complex design, explains Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes there is enough roofs over the head and a tabloid to warn of the time of arrival of transport.
Here, for example, the subway Yacenevo has recently opened a completely flat-sized transplant knot.
Let's have no hangings, but with the intercepting parking and the platoon showing when the bus arrives.
But in the race for the number of officials, they're recording everything they're getting.
As early as 2011, the Mayor planned to build all 151 knots, of which 59 were capitalized.
Currently, there are up to 255 TTPs in plans up to 2020.
Of these, one and a half are promised to surrender this year.
Although there is a TPN development programme in town, no qualitative criteria are identified, Alexander Morosov, co-chair of the public organization City and Transport.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplants on each of them is often deteriorating.
In the expert ' s opinion, there should be two criteria: first, reduction of transplant time, second, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without raining.
In Moscow, however, the PMS sometimes runs exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the UDNH subway.
Previously, the suburban buses from the Yaroslav highway came to the square before the main entrance to VCV.
Their stops were now moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka on the street of Cosmonauts.
Farther away from the subway, far away from the monastery, it's closer to the living houses.
It was a gift that the inhabitants did not want to have an automobile under the windows and complained about all possible instances.
With the capital TPUs in Moscow, it didn't work right away.
The first of them started building five years ago at Planerna Metro.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And there's really a sample of how the transplant node, which is paid to investors, turns into a banal trade centre.
No, there's bus spaces, a valve to keep the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lots.
True, the Chimkin Trolleybuses Nos. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow had no place in principle.
As strangers, they were moved away from the subway.
But there's more room to trade.
It's just 32 shops, and there's almost everything, from zoos to autosalon.
Well, really, then, who of the bus passengers would need to buy a new car on the road?
We've always got a shopping center when we're building a capital tube.
Recently, the situation had reached a logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot had decided to market.
At the third floor of the Planerna TAP, there is now a brawling trade among the floor-marked parking areas.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards who look abusively at our photographer.
The transplant knot eventually turned into a market.
The thing is, the Planerna Metro had a market before, but it was dropped.
And in the prefecture, the traders were pitied and put on a crossing parking unit.
Still, because of high prices, it is always empty.
The ridiculous thing was that the market was cut down to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's a rocket.
In the subway, the Calughian approach from the subway to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morosov.
After the construction of a trade centre, allegedly TPS, the distance increased to 170 m.
To get to the bus, you have to go through the whole shopping center.
After 22 hours, it's closed, it's just going through the open sky.
On the other hand, the designs on "Planerna" and "Calugh" will soon show up with flowers.
In mid-September, the City-Earth Commission of the Mayor approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPS.
Four of them will be 25-story without counting two or three underground yards.
The main monster will grow up at the Tushino subway, and it will have 418,7,000 square metres of area.
Representatives of the RCD railway stations responsible for the construction of TPOs in the subway have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be distributed in future multi-stage areas.
At the same time, officials are assured that multi-iron parking takes the mut from one third to one half of the area.
Take, for example, "National" garage.
Let's say the garage is 258 cars, which have recently been built on the International Street, with an area of 1,815 square metres.
So it's going to take about 80,000 quadratives for the parking of 2.6,000 cars at the Petrovsco-Romovska.
It's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to every bus space.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial property.
And this is almost two GUMs for a minute.
If the capital TPS are built by railway stations and stations, the rest of the sites will be covered by the Metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional-purpose objects," including hotels, offices and even gymnasiums.
In fact, in the Moscow City Department of Equipment, journalists have recently been informed that they are developing a draft decree that investors will be able to apply directly to officials to receive a TMO site.
No competitions.
Because, um, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPC is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Land in Toronto, is sure Alexander Morosov.
There, trolleybuses and trams fall under the ground to the subway level, and the distance from the subway to the tramwa is only 50 metres without going to the street.
There's no over-trafficking around.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we're not building anything, or we're already hitting 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esther proposes to equate extremism with insults of patriotic feelings
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults against Russia, Justice Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish for this for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper Lizvetiya, such amendments to legislation prepared by the Duma Committee on Energy, Oleque Miheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and Government to obtain a conclusion.
Under the patriotic sentiments of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person to a country whose national is a country of love, responsible for its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
According to Micheiev, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of formal signs of State authority, flag and herb.
In this regard, the parliamentarian believes that the protection of Russians whose feelings may be overwhelmed and insulted by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is not sufficient in Russian legislation.
As an example, he sets out the annual debate on the Day of Victory, where some media professionals allow themselves to question the heroic controversy of the USSR in the fight against the Fascists.
On the eve of the main nationwide celebration, the Day of Victory on May 9, a real vacanal is being launched annually.
In an obsession and an "alternative view" of history, some writers have come to reason that it is a pity for the German cultures not to win the wild Soviet Union!
I think this is absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual fortress” nation, and it is resentful to Oleg Micheiev.
Furthermore, according to Michael, the patriotic people in Russia are far more than religious, but the law punishes the insults of believers, while insulting the patriotic feelings can be virtually impunity.
In the opinion of the popular election, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to impose appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill penalizes the insult of patriotic feelings, ranging from a fine of 100 to 5 years ' imprisonment.
The earthquake of the magnetud 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the Kokimbo area in central Chile, transmits the Reuters Agency.
The earthquake scene was in the ocean at a distance of 10.7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as specified on the U.S. Geological Service Web site (USGS).
Points were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03,1 November, Moscow).
Victims or underground destruction have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the earth, so earthquakes are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the earthquake of 8.8 and the tsunami caused by it resulted in the death of over 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, in Chile, the most powerful earthquake in the recent history occurred: in 1960, the magnetus number was 9.5.
That disaster killed more than 5,000 people.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace's case will be dealt with fairly.
The Prime Minister of the RF Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we hear all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," stated Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the Prime Minister of France, Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists, there is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisani, like the rest of the activists, is charged with bullying.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero, "RIA Newsty".
“Our country cannot support activities that may cause environmental damage, no one has the right to violate laws”, stated in turn Dmitry Medvedev.
He said that any structure that attempted to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, was dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “as a powder barrel,” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting the RIA News.
The United Nations declares new goals for poverty alleviation
The United Nations should immediately begin working on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the MDG Goals, which expired in 2015, until the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio on the eve of the evening.
They were included in the outcome document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to the summit on the eve of the evening that it was now time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the process of establishing the universal sustainable development goals, the CSD,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the concept of development beyond 2015.
I will make every effort to take advantage of the authority given to me by Member States to translate our vision of sustainable development, which is based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are increasing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Looking above the statues of Samaria Mashel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan the slogans for peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing of the future of her country, she changed the business suit to the T-shirt, decorated with the "We Require Security" label in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital Plant of Independence.
During the two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between Government forces and Renamo were among the most brutal encounters since the conclusion of the truce more than 20 years ago.
Renamo had once been known by the rebel movement, which had been supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia first and then by the Government of South Africa of the apartheid as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to relapse into a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have forced foreign investors and local residents to become disturbed.
The high rates for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge shelf gas and coal deposits in north-west could attract more than $50 billion as investments for the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarco from the United States.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the lead political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accused each other of the tension.
The Renamo Party argues that the Government has become the initiator of the recent clashes by attacking its members in the Province of Sofala, the traditional wall of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels subsequently aggravated when government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakamu, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Hebuza tried to dispel fears of instability.
Hebuza stated to the French information agency AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt “unsuccessful”, wishing to use “everything left of his strength to try to prove that he could impose on the Government his own decisions”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after the report that Mazanga had declared refusal of Renamo's 1992 peace agreement.
He informed Financial Times that he had in mind the non-compliance with the Frelimo Party agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness,” said Mazang.
Previous negotiations between the parties had little to do to alleviate the tensions that a series of clashes increased this year.
“These are two powerful men (Gebouza and Dhlakama) who have met the foreheads,” said Joseph Hunlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are a good negotiator and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections appointed for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by weakening movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The proportion of Renamo votes has declined since 1992, whereas the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which is based on the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Ghebuza, who had to leave the post next year, when his second term was over, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” said Mazang.
It was not clear what the Renamo had been able to do, but it had already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the collisions took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of rail routes about a week after Renamo threatened with an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was erroneous when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that the cases in Mozambique were not very good,” said Mazang.
Instability has increased the Government ' s displeasure, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent abductions, says Fernando Lima, head of the Independent Mediacoop Media.
“People believe that the Government and President are responsible for the future of the country, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares for Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to resume peace, they want free access to the roads, ” he said.
The Arth Meinstrem series of premieres will take place in Moscow.
An Arth Meinstrem series of films, where audiences can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they get to the procate, will be held at the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports the News, with reference to the project organizers.
Opens the Art Meinstrema programme of the French director and actress Reim Kerich "Paris Any Price".
This is a history of the Mai (as Kerichi) model working in the French capital, which is being deported to Morocco because of the visa problems.
In addition to the film Kerichi, the audience will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duke, Mebius, the melodramatic Biopic Oliver Hirschbiguel, Diana: The History of Love (Diana) and Naomi Wotts, in their main role and the main film of the Kannian film “Living Adel” Abdelatif Kesish.
The only Russian participant in the Arth-Ministery will win at the Kinotaur festival, Alexander Veledin's Geographic Globes is on the basis of Alexey Ivanov's single-named novel.
The main role, Victor Serkin's promiscuous teacher, was played in the film by Constantine Habenski, whose work was also marked by the Kinotavra prize.
Children must study myths and legends as “models of life,” says the author.
The Torah's story could show that “the grave power cannot win a simplicity”, and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “the most wild, too scandalous and, in some cases, too obscene for teaching in schools”, Krossley Holland advocates the “hard selection” of suitable texts by age.
“I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklors are already part of education,” he said.
I advocated their introduction into the twenty-year curriculum.
He added that the “excessive moralism” of the authors and teachers “has taken interest” in children and that the main ideas are“solved” in fascinating stories.
Krossley-Holland, who translated Beowlf from Anglo-Saxon, and wrote the Norwegian Myth Companion for the Penguin and the British People's Falls, said, “You may have intentions, but you'd better keep them with you.”
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy end, but that it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and bad.
This must be sublimized; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: Show, not tell.
A soccer fan was detained in Voroneskaya, breaking the window in the station waiting room.
At 9:00 p.m. on 29 October, two soccer fans, the Moscow region, were removed from the passenger train at the Grazi-Voronez police station.
When they went to the favorite team, the guys on the road made a drunken bastard on the train.
Young people were delivered to the police line office at the Grazi station for the preparation of an administrative offence report.
There, fans repented of their antisocial conduct.
The police have issued administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for the station to arrive at the station.
In the morning, fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, came back suddenly and smashed the front door window in the station's waiting room with his foot.
A transport police officer and CIS guard rode on the twisted glass on the bell.
They succeeded in arresting a wrongdoer trying to escape the scene.
The Russian Ministry of Internal Oversight Services is inspected.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was being resolved, and the senior referendum for the provision of information and public relations from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs on the transport of Sergei Olhovik had reported.
Vital Mutko: Watermets?
I think we've been back 15 years.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutoko, expressed his view of the riots on the rostrum during the Russian Shinnik-Spartac match.
I'm a supporter of all of this to be responsible for sports organizers: clubs, leagues, RFCs.
But we can see they've taken a screwing position.
They're waiting for someone to come and make order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly the right one.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards instead of letting the case go on their own.
We have now drafted a special government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
After it has been accepted, we will deal closely with this problem.
But I'm still going to invite all the soccer organizers.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, um, let's get the law quicker.
It feels like the Bawari fans have come to Jaroslavl and they're all set up.
We're outside observers.
It's awful to see the rods polished from a firefight.
And it's in a country that's preparing for a world championship.
"I feel like we're back 10 or 15 years ago," said Mutoko.
Snouden can interrogate in Russia
A U.S. special service officer, Edward Snouden, is likely not going to leave Russia to testify on the German Chancellor's telecommunications by Angels Mercel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, an American may answer questions from the German Genocorese in writing or in the eye in Russia.
Edward Snowen's exit outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be issued to Washington by U.S. alliances," said the agency interviewer.
“In principle, the FWG's genes could send their representatives to the FM or refer written questions to Snowden,” added the source, adding that the issue should be dealt with at the inter-State level.
Previously, the representative of the German Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebel reported that Edward Snowen was ready to testify in the case of a hearing by the German Chancellor.
Cnoudden stands ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in the territory of Germany.
The CIA's ex-worker gave me the idea that he knew a lot.
Although the U.S.AN has blocked all his movements, Snowen is ready to come to Germany.
To that end, however, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival,” said Strebel, Euronews telecommunications.
Snowen counsel Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement by the source of Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
U.S. Citizen Edward Snowen, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANB) and CIA, ran to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information on United States internet surveillance operations.
Snoudden flew through Moscow transit, but he was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities who had made serious charges to him and remained in the Séremetiero airport transit zone before August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document on temporary asylum in the Russian territory for a year and left Sheremethiero on the same day.
Last night American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren stated that his client had set up for work in a "great Russian company".
The NSA tracking at Angela Mercel last week was reported to the German media.
According to journalists, the Chancellor’s telephone talks had begun by Americans since 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing these information, stated that surveillance for Mercelle violated German laws and sovereignty.
The Ponomares left the "Just Russia"
The deputy of the State Duma from the Justice Russia Party, a member of its office in Novosibirsk, Ilja Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he made a statement to the New Siberian Regional Party.
According to her statute, this automatically means that Ponomares have left the ranks of “justsprudence”.
We're sitting, drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Illa Ponomarev puts on the table of blasts," but there's nothing that's epoch in it," commented the deputy.
Ponomares noted that they maintained good relations with the regional office of the Esserov.
In the meantime, Ilja Ponomarov has no intention of refusing from the mandate of the Deputy of the Lord.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not leave it by law.
Reports of the intention of Elijah Ponomarev to leave the “Rightly Russia” party appeared on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valerie Zubov would come out with him, but the latter soon refuted this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Mida Fumio Kisida met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“Would be frank to exchange views on the further development of the political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of the peace treaty”, said the Kisid meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Sinzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Newsty.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the disputed North Territories.
In this regard, Tokyo has now been protesting and demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
On the Japanese capital, cars are driven by the loudspeaker, "Take back the northern territories!".
The police are not stopping the protesters; they are watching to keep the noise below.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Commodation Festival: New Yorker
You can boldly claim that New York is a place of birth in America as a standap team: almost a hundred years ago an audible artist Frank Fae, who worked a conference at the Palace Theatre theatre theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fey's innovation over time has been captured by others, very recently, the New York comedy festival.
Caroline Hursh, founder of the Carolines Standap Club, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixtieth show in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these hedlineers started in Carolines and then achieved greater success, reached the level when they were too famous to speak at the club, ” said Horsch.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presentations by Wanda Saix, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standap for Heroes, an annual musical and team concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstin, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosby will appear.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example, through a show on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known by the role in the membrane series on a small-known cable telecanal (should be a FXLL scraped on FX on Fentesi-futbola), and is now conducting his own cocket-show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleit entered the actorial composition, both in the Sabbath evening in direct air and in the Parks and Rest Zones, although she is most well known for the series of viral roles of Marsel - Skull in Botocks.
And Kroll and Sleit, like other young self - style comedians (Surealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a wicked one focused on racial theme Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
David Steinberg's interviews with Larry David will be one of the most vivid points of the festival.
Steinberg started as a stendap-comic, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the leading TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place at the City Hall Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of the entire work of Larry,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walks a street between the two houses and thinks, "If I stay completely without money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities began negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported to the Embassy of that country in Britain, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawas Sharif, is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-President Nick Kleg, with which he discussed the relations between Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the Taliban dialogue had begun,” says the statement of the Pakistan Embassy in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” added diplomats.
Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan) is an allies of a single Afghan movement, but operates independently in the north-west of the country borders with Afghanistan.
The Pakistan Taliban is seeking the creation of the Islamic State.
Previously, the Government of Islamabad had attempted to start negotiations with local talibs, but the movement had renounced the dialogue.
It stated that it would go to negotiations only if the authorities took troops stationed in the areas of the Taliban and released the arrested Islamists from prisons.
Navas Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, David Cameron, Prime Minister of Great Britain, Head of the Pakistani Government and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell in the price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil has continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about large stockpiles have hampered the message showing that China ' s energy-intensive productive sector is gaining strength.
The U.S. petroleum leader, in December, had raised 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later than the European time in electronic bidding on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract was raised by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the October price of 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy on Wednesday stated that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the reserves were filled by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry that demonstrated its resurgence.
This suggests that China ' s economic recovery can continue to take effect after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Oil Brent, a reference class of international oil, also used by United States refineries, went up 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
The chief coach of the Collorado, Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goccer of Simeon Warlamam from the first minute of the Friday match with "Dallas," expressed confidence that the recent night behind the crack had not undermined his confidence in the Russians had been conveyed from Dallas subcor to Natalia Schmelev.
And what we're waiting for, Rua said after the morning's lavin.
Of course, all of us are concerned, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out to ice today.
We want him to go out to the ice and show us his normal level.
So you're totally sure that the situation hasn't had any impact on the shopping condition?
I'll see you today.
No doubt our players will support Warley by helping him to protect the gate, as was the case in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court decides on this situation.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: the warm tomato doesn't replace the soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, correspondent RIA Newsty discovered.
People who completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
They do not carry winter without health loss, and no warm tomatoes compensate them, consider New Siberian dietists and doctors interviewed prior to the Day of Vegan.
Drinking oil with litres
Strict vegetarianism, when not only the meat and the fish, but also the milk, the honey, the eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, adherence to such rigorous dietary standards is at least inappropriate for health.
Animal renunciation is harmful.
Animal proteins contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with vegetation.
You have to keep milk or eggs in the diet," I'm sure dietologist Marina Gody.
It gives an example of fish containing an indispensable fat Omega-3 acid.
The richest plant oil for them is linen.
"In order to use it as quantities for a person, you need litres!" says a dietologist.
The medical community is confident that food needs to be given to Siberian residents in the winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is particularly questioned.
In our realities, there are high demands for food.
You need increased calories to keep you free of freezing.
"If a person restricts himself by animal products, he is deprived of this calorie accordingly," says the expert.
That's what Olga's dietologist agrees.
She adds that wet vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for a person to feed mainly on products that are grown in or where he was born.
Genetic codes are designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, not a cuddle, but a hot soup or something more leaning,” the doctor explains his position.
According to her, vegans may benefit from various grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries.
But that is certainly not enough for full food.
According to Claudia Arifulina, a reservoir doctor, the level of vitamins in the organisms is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our tough natural conditions, when temperature can change to 30 degrees per day and the snow lies in May, is inappropriate.
The organism needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors point out that vegetation is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need construction material, including amino acids.
As we maintain vegetarianism, we give them incomplete.
Pregnant also require increased protein, vitamins and microelement content in the menu.
"The guerrillas fail them," is sure of God.
Arithulin says adults are free to choose whatever they want, to play the toys they want.
He's got already formed organism, skeleton, organs.
And yet, children must feed fully.
If his parents deprive him of some microellem or amino acid by picking for him what he will eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The shortage of any substance for brain development, vision, bones tomorrow will not be restored," she says.
All interviewed medical professionals agree on the low quality of winter-produced heat and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and cultivated in the heats contains fewer micro-elements necessary to us than (provided) in the open soil.
"The quality of food is wrong," says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to produce more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't become brown in the slice, the cucumbers are quick to yellow and plunge, the tomatoes are inconsistent and neuromatic," is an example of the doctor, adding that they are likely to be overflowing with fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not in agreement with the Siberian Physical Institute of Agrarians, the Agricultural Clergy candidate, Ver Petrouk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all thermal standards and requirements, full vegetables could be cultivated.
If they try to expel more than a square metre, they will, of course, become more frequent and feed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there's too much nitrogen fertilizers, the tomatoes grow fast, they're large but watery and fragile," she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily dependent on the producer's conscience.
The Court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “cessing and searching” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a judgement requiring modifications to the New York Police Department ' s programme and dismissed the judge.
The Second U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Sheindlin would be suspended until the results of the city appeal were obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city was violated by the Constitution in the manner in which he carried out the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and the decision on corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a supervisor to help the police office to change the practice of work and the associated training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the proceedings of the parties on a motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it had violated the code of conduct of the judges of the United States and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing prejudice, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that the police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, relying unjustly on black and Latin Americans under the “disclosure” programme.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the major changes that include policy reforms, training and monitoring, and also decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of persons whose cases were discontinued after the police check.
The city ' s appeal debate should take place after 14 March 2014.
Tactics of “continue and search” were criticized by a number of civil rights lawyers.
The stop-track has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically in the administration of the independent mayor of Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin.
In 2004, four persons, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective action before the court.
Reservants of the change in the New York police department said that these changes would put an end to unfair practices, create a more robust and effective police service and may affect the way other police departments implement this practice.
The opponents argue that changes will reduce the military spirit of police rather than crime, lead to unnecessary wastes of money and will not address the more global problem of complex police conditions, owing to a few thousand reduction in the number of officers in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “concerning-and-seeking”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police stopped people.
The Pedestrian Zone was opened in the area of the Thirdjak Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is situated in the area of the Thirdyakov Gallery and sits two kilometres from the Novokzenski subway to the Bolot Square.
Street bags, flowers, benches, hurricanes and toilets have been installed throughout the world, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Climentovsky and Lavruszin penetrations, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars, the Ordine impasse, the Great and Small Tolmachevsk, the Cadashev Coast Area and the Bolot.
The traffic on the streets of Maroseik and Petrovka is not limited.
At a pedestrian station in the Pentecost Street from the Newsweek Station Lobby to the Climentovsk Road, the pedestrian conditions were created without de-moving and cutting the carriageway, transmitting newsmsk.com.
In the pedestrian area, there was a third’s gallery, a temple of Clement of Pope Clement, the museums, libraries, monuments, and other spectacles.
The first part of the pedestrians was the Tver Passage, the Stolechniks, and the Kuznetsky Most Street.
The large Dmitrov, where the pedestrian zone opened early in September, decided to shut down for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hacking to verify a confidential message
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coleson allegedly used “a phone crack, tracking and resistance” when trying to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke's novel, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, Andrew Edis, Royal Lawyer, informed the Old Bayley Court that in May 2005 the News of the World received an unreasonable news that Clark met with Hanna Polby's “intentional special adviser.”
The paper commissioned the private detective, Glenn Mulkeir, to break Polby's voice mail and to warn her from the house to interview, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, heard the court.
“The apology believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW,” he was not the man who would be standing in front of someone's house, hoping to get someone out of the way, he's a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they're going to say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World used three ways of investigating stories: phone breaking, tracking and countering.
The editor's personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the tracking, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says, "No, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The messages of Clark's novel were the first to draw attention to News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Paulby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The ballot cassette received from her phone at least three times was withdrawn from Mulkaira ' s house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were described as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby and grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turnbek and former reporter James Westerap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
Having left her a voice message on 18 June 2005, Coулson said: “I have a story that we are going to publish tomorrow and which I would really like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coulson ' s participation in this history took place on the same scenario as other influential people, such as David Blankett, former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blankett on a novel with a married woman while he himself met Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny the conspiracy with other people for the purpose of breaking the phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turlbek and Weserap confessed to the hacking of the phones.
Snowden is willing to communicate with the authorities of the FWG on the hearing case.
Ex-CIA member Edward Snoud expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and meet with the authorities of the FWG, transmits the RIA News.
A letter from a former member of the CIA to the FWG at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday introduced the Bundestag deputy of Hans-Cristian Strebele, through which Snowen sent a message to the German authorities.
Strobele had met Snowden in Moscow before.
Four people were affected by the fire on the Tver Street
Four passersby were affected by the combustion in a collector in the centre of Moscow, on the Tver Street.
According to Interfax with a reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims is hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby during a fire in a suffocated underground crossing suffered.
According to RIA Newsti, with reference to the head of the capital department of Paul Livinsky Fuel and Energy, all homes on Tver Street are now fully equipped.
The fire was fired in a heat collector near the 15th on the Tver Street in the evening of 31 October.
Strong smoke came from the rainbow sewage, and the ground crossing at the Armeny store created a residue.
As a result of the burning, 11 houses on the Tver Street were declining.
At 21:45 Moscow Time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. USD cuts the food allowance for the poor
Nutrition allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial provision for products known as “foodstamps” has been reduced since the end of the relevant public programme.
The family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars a month less than that previously, by officials.
This will affect 47 million poorest Americans.
According to the Reuters Agency, in fiscal year 2012, one person ' s benefit was an average of $133 per month.
The cost of food aid in the United States increased to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by “foodstamps” that had been named since they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress require further reductions in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
The owners of food stores throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
The U.S. Congresses continue to argue as much as possible to reduce government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformr free of charge.
Blizzard Studio released a Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge in 1994.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game has become available in Battle.net in the classic games of Blizzard.
However, some geymers point out that only users whose shares are of the American service are currently able to download it.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version Blizzard now released on the PC is not different from the original game.
The Blackthorne soundrack also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne's platformr, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came to the SNES console.
His events took place on the planet Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day the Dark Ruler, Sarlak, decided to kill the bright king of Vloros and become the only ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vloros Kyle, whom he was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight Sarlack's ambassadors and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There'll be new machines in Moscow.
But selling tickets to passengers will be not for money, but for meeting.
One trip of 30 roubles will cost a potential passenger of 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by means of modern technology, reported by ITAR TASS with reference to the Russian Olympic Committee press service.
The first equipment will be installed at the Exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new tickets, the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Jukov, and the Olympic champions of the hymnastics, Alexey Nemov and Helena Zuphodicov, will be present.
The recognition of the National Security Agency is strengthened by the paranoia of corporations with respect to public surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Intelligence Service, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. office building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media said that BfV had hoped to detect antennas for listening devices, which had led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clepper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the United States did not use external intelligence “to steal commercial secrets from foreign companies in the interest of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowen, a contract servant who has been exposed, began publishing his treasure of intelligence secrets, European governments, and companies’ leaders no longer know if the director could be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has monitored the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data stored by United States cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations caused by State surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that the chancellor Angela Mercel's phone had been listening for about ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, of course, the potential targets are also business leaders.
Cnoudden made it clear that there was intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it is likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up, ” says Oliver Grunn, president of the BITMI association, which represents Germany's small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in industrial spying and data theft, according to a study published by the EY Consulting Agency in July.
Nevertheless, all documents opened by Mr. Snowden have not yet witnessed that the United States has transferred the commercial secrecy of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some capacity in information technology and the Internet and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependency on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option, ” says Gasso Platner, president of a German software provider for the SAP business.
If there was a need for a strong European IT industry, it was not worth letting it die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except IT.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spying agencies that were known by Snouden's revelations was a shock to some companies who had previously thought China's greatest risk.
A great shift occurs in cloud technologies, where European companies have better understood that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the U.S. cloud provider after the discovery of an American intellectual data analysis programme.
Jim Snaib, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said: “We see consumers ask a new question that didn't arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely evidence of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore should be protected at any price.
The economic spy is not surprising.
He's always been there.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate, ” says Kurt Bock, Chief Executive Director of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we're spying them too, because it's part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the response they have taken, as this can give the advantage to the opposer.
In large companies, it has long been learned that taking a free flash on the exhibition or leaving the laptop without looking at the hotel number is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of Audi Automobile Construction, says that for many years it has been a standard practice to collect mobile phones before meeting of government so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service of Germany recommends that company leaders consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel owing to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently thrown out.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” warns BfV.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic spy from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report, in February, placed France with Russia and Israel in the second set of offenders who were engaged in hackerry for economic exploration after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that, when it comes to an economic spy, “Frenchs are worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former leader of the French DCRI Internal Intelligence Agency, reportedly stated in an interview this month: “It is well known that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died by “unlucky accident” believe that their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside a spindle sports mat in his high school sports hall, believe that their son was killed, stated the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Waldost State of Georgia, was found on January 11, in a vertically standing mat, hidden back to the rostrum in his high school sports hall.
Investigators of the Loundes District Sheriff Administration concluded that Johnson had died on a tragic occasion, but the family of 17-year-olds challenged this.
“They are absolutely confident that their son was killed,” said Fox News.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kennet and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, physics laws and common sense,” said Krump.
They think it's a shelter to protect the person or people responsible for the death of his son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a bag for corpses,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into the death of Johnson, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement to the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they bring them.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I take the view that there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the initial autopsy had shown that Johnson had died as a result of the “position asfix”.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds evidence enough to require a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Loundes District Sheriff office was not available to comment on Thursday.
The judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the videotapes of the surveillance cameras that the investigators saw on Wednesday.
The parents of a teenager said they hoped that video recordings would contain the key to determining how he died.
Spartak: For information on persons who have hanged the fascist symbol

Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools dealing with allergies in children
On the Wednesday, the centres for disease control and prevention published a list of recommendations for monitoring food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now have a meal allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that the incidence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness of child food allergies among teachers and service staff and how to assist in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of adrenaline — most often for injections, using an automatic EpiPen medical syringe — to assist with potentially deadly anaphylaxy.
State legislative bodies have recently amended their regulations to allow schools to make stockpiles of adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of the typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic response.
Children may say, "It feels like something's coming up in my tongue," "that I have hair in my language," or, "music pinch."
Parents of intersexual children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany has become the first European country to recognize the third half of children born with foreign genital organs of the intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer be obliged to attribute male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “undefined” or “undefined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions on the treatment of therapy of newborns and to counter discrimination against intersexual people.
One intersexual man, according to BBC, said many years later, “I'm not a man or a woman.”
I'll stay with the doctors in a bruise with bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological substances that are diagnosed as “sexual destruction” — a collection term for people with a typical chromosomes, gonads (yes or seeds) or uncommonly developed external sex bodies.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
The gender identification is still insufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if any.
The New York Psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law would “sound as a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how the person develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery of why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as different from transsexual or transgender, because their condition is not gender-related but their biological structure, which is not exclusively consistent with male or female, but typical to both at the same time or not characterized by any of them.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sex, such as the muscle mass, the distribution of the hair, the breast and the corpus; the primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general understanding of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in employment, as well as of the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crimes.
Boys with gender deficiencies now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or third sex in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norry Mae-Welby, became the first person in the world recognized as “exempt”, defending the right to remain “undefined” sex for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, a third symbol will be used in German passports in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to the news release of France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this strongly-expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to seize the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Web site Catholic Online also expressed dissent with the German law, stating that “in a situation where the world is moving into a new state where the sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization”.
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set up gender at birth.
“The child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child, ” she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital bodies were referred to as Germanphrodites, by name of the beautiful Greek god, who had the marks of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived the gender as a leaf to erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many challenge ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that a gender identity is difficult, and that doctors sometimes make a wrong choice without knowing how a child will view the sex as he grows up.
“In the mid - 20th century, this was called an unrestrained psychiatric accident,” said Drescher.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
A dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents raise children — interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would consider himself to be a male or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theory was questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis was damaged during the negligible circumcision, casting the child completely, also removed his eggs, and growing him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but that was not the case,” said Drescher.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the coming of the Internet, the survivors of these gender-change operations declared themselves “unsatisfactory”.
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY but with intermediate genitals.
The doctors were unable to determine precisely whether he had a large clinic or a small penis and were convinced that he would never live a man's “full life”.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genital body and eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said to ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was assigned to vaginoplastics.
But while depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a sexual infringement that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone injects and removing his chest.
The operation made him unfruitful.
Today, he defends others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people to a standard of perception with intersexuality.
But Ann Themer-Mettis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “walks the labels and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child “undefined sex,” she said.
We're afraid he's going to contribute to interference.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is to build assumptions.
Themer-Mathtis said that her organization supported the Australian law, since “it allows adults to make a choice for the third sex”.
“Agrowth people must be able to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she says.
The German law implies that it is awarded at birth.
It is a battle in which small children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baraz, a Pittsburgh mammoologist who has a daughter who has a sexual infringement and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baraz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual breakdown called “a syndrome of total indifference to anthrogens”.
Since her anoronic receptors are not working correctly, Kathy has developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but there's no uterus and ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and has a child psychiatric order at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although unfruitful, she hopes to be a parent by adopting or hesitating surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own, ” said Baraz.
It gives them time to do some analysis and address the situation, as well as a period of time before they write the “human” or “woman”.
In such a case, you are fine — growing a child, loving a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you are happy.
We do not have to rush into an irreversible operation.
“This enables children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that parents drive because they don’t feel they're doing what is right, ” she said.
Eventually, a child will decide what sex is more comfortable with — and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make a decision on their own.
Chicago's doctor, Nicolas Habibulin, stressed that he understands that he has to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard for training.
In the last two meetings, Habibulin missed six Tampa Bays first and four from Ottawa, and in the second game, he was replaced after the fourth skipped chaiba.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I couldn't do that, and CSNChicago brings the word Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, maybe we should approach them as a game, and try to get a better outcome.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training, I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some snow comma.
Maybe I need a little relaxation.
The gateyards -- I don't think I'm alone -- always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
Whatever happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself so I can't miss so much cheib.
It's great that my collars support, but in principle it's easy: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put this down.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
At Altai, the flight bus turned over.
In the Rubsk region of the Altay province, a PAZ flight bus was moved.

Nedvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be shipped to Europe
Russia expects that, once the markets of Latin America and Asia have been installed, superjet 100 will be installed in Europe.
“We hope that, in general, we will receive more than 170 copies of such aircraft,” quotes Interfax, the words of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev at a press conference with the Prime Minister Jean-Marc Airo of France.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues involved in insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be available to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he'll ever be in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft constructed by the State Sukhogo aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Lainer has been developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The Dniepropetratives have launched a unique rescue programme... the aist nest.
In an old age, the villagers placed a wheel on a high stake to lead to the aristian courtyard, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports are long gone, so the aists have admired the columns of the electric transmission lines - interwoven branches relying on the wire, making the authentic cottage safe.
Grandmother Anja, whose home in the village of Ivanovka of Petrikov, had been living with a true family for the past 20 years, noticed the nest sitting down despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new branches on top, and the lower layer is already sifting between the wires, it's about to fall.
Of course, it's a pity for a family of aists who go to the courtyard each year, to get out and fed in the summer of three or four birds, but they don't want to stay.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, her grandmother, Anya, called the Queen’s REC, who owns the backbone.
And I didn't even expect it to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding at all, -- said DTAC Technical Director, Dnieprooplenergo, Sergei Berezovski.
In fact, corrosion began on wires that were already inside a nest weighing between 150 and 200 pounds [50 to 200 kg].
At any time, birds could have been killed by electrical discharge.
And the local people were at risk of being lightless because of the damage to the wires.
Linear monters have therefore begun to save their nests, not for the first time in our practice.
Fornitologists from the Dniepropetros National University have helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They did training for the district network staff.
A well - known dniepropetrov ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko consulted energy agents at all stages of nesting.
For the first time, it was estimated that more than 50 authentic apartments were located in the emergency situation.
Special metal platforms reminiscent of the crow were quarrelled for their reconstruction.
The base was filled with ivory branches, and then the old nest was transferred there.
According to the experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for birds to recognize and return to the nest.
Then the aists will build their own dwellings.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of Novomoskoka.
A new iron-propelled pillar was placed next to the electrical cord and placed on it a platform with an old nest already covered.
The whole operation cost nine thousand rubber energy.
On the other hand, the same village was held in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikov, on the departure of Ani’s grandmother.
Here the platform was locked up in the previous place, only lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “home ” has been repaired.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four other nests in the Dnipropetrovik region of Po blood and Queenstan.
By the way, while some are rescued by rare birds, others kill them mercilessly.
On the day, the whole area was overflowing with the sad news -- in the village of Ust Kamnka of the Apostolic district, on the day of the opening of the phasing, poachers shot the leisure family living on the local pond for fun.
The virtuous birds were not afraid of the people, but the locals were feeding them and not hurting them.
When the villagers, after hearing the shots, fled to the pond, the four lovers of the Leeds were already lying on the water dead.
Today, the Apostolic Ray Department of Police finds out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russian march" is becoming more popular.
On 4 November, the Day of People's Unity, in Moscow, the Mayor of the Russian Marsh will be held.
According to the Levada Centre survey, support for the Russian Marches is growing - 40 per cent of the citizens are now at different levels concurring with the idea of carrying out the march.
According to Levada Centre, 40 per cent of citizens approve the Russian marches to a different degree: 11 per cent of them relate to such actions definitely positively and 29 per cent “better positive”.
The popularity of the Russian Marshalls is gradually growing, with only 14 per cent of Russians welcomed in 2006, and in December 2010, more than twice the number of citizens (28 per cent) supported such activities.
"Definitely negative" to "Russian march" are only 7% Russians, "speed negative" - 19%.
Another 35 per cent were unable to formulate their attitude to this share.
This year the Moscow mayor agreed to the RSM of up to 15,000 in Ljublino, which was reported today by the head of the Department of Security of the capital of Alexay Mayorov.
This nationalist action has been held every year on the Day of People ' s Unity since 2005.
On the question of the Sociologists, “Did you hear that the Russian Marches are being held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans of the protection of the rights of the Russians in Russia?" Three quarters (75%) of the citizens replied negatively.
It is now only one fifth of Russians who know about it (20%).
Significantly, in December 2010 about a third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the “Russian Marches”.
Recall that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural nationalist meeting was held on the Manese Square, which was overturned in massive riots.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians about the celebration of November 4.
In two years, the number of people who knew the correct answer (People Unity Day) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of the citizens attend this holiday.
Approximately the same (17 per cent) intend to celebrate on 7 November the October Revolution Day.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As the Moscow mayor agreed to the Russian Marce in Ljublino.
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed on the holding of the Russian Marshall on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of Mars by Dmitry Demoskin.
In addition to the march in Ljublino on the Day of People's Unity, a meeting and a rock conference of the Coolrat group will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
How was the Russian March-2012?
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, nationalists were marching from the Yakana Coast to the Central House of the artist, where the meeting was held.
The organizers evaluated the number of participants of 20,000, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama ' s electoral headquarters considered Baiden ' s deletion in favour of Hillari Clinton
According to The New York Times, the next advisers of President Barak Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most vivid sensation from all the expected book of Mark Galperin and John Hailemann on the 2012 Stocks: Game Changed 2012.
The Times has received a copy of the book prepared for the exit, and reported on Thursday evening that the nearest President's assistants conducted “master studies in focus groups and public opinion interviews at the end of 2011” to assess whether the Baiden exception could help raise the diminishing hopes for the re-election of Obama.
According to the political surveyor The Times Jonathan Martin Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by high-ranking officials of the electoral headquarters and the White House, namely, the former head of the White House administration of Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago Pre-electoral Headquarters and the Oval Cabinet.
Only six nearest Presidential advisers — including Daley, former head of Obama's electoral headquarters, Messiah and former senior advisers of the White House David Axelrod and David Pluffa — knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book “Stawki doubled” argues that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their “different personal relations”, but eventually refused this step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not “better substantially the chances of Obama”.
In an interview with Martin Daley, it confirmed that the Administration had really considered the possibility of replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I have been actively involved in considering a multitude of things, and this was one of them, ” said Daley.
You should remember that at that time the President was in a terrible form, so we thought, "O God, what are we going to do?"
Although Daley described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the electoral headquarters had invested enough in studying whether this step would lead to a vote.
“The pre-election headquarters do not spend such money on interviews and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” said Martin in the AC 360 programme.
It was not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about the possible retract.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President had been “inquired” of a possible replacement, the former head of the Administration acknowledged that, ‘possibly, ’ Obama knew.
Martin added that the Stavki doubled did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political sensation had reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he took it seriously that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of deleting Baiden from the electoral list.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
Would you like a ice cream shining in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first dark ice ice cream with a honeycomb.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a bright food.
He came to this idea by reading the scientific article on medise, and convinced scientists in China to regenerate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream responds to the language of the one who eats it, increasing the level of pH in the protein and making it light.
Chris says that as the ice cream begins to shine when it responds to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you ski, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company, "Leave me, I'm good," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the earliest stage, if you're talking about production, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of substance."
The protein that we use in ice cream is reacting to your language at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, it's going to increase the pH level and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months, and it seemed perfect to introduce it to Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful bright effect.
This may be the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because the density of the meduse is four times as expensive as gold.
So every balloon is worth about $140.
But it's pretty nice to taste.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef, and taste of bite gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really want to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's not possible by definition because of the breakdown caused by the ice crystals of which ice is made up of ice, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse synthesized by Chinese scientists
Vladimir Chebaturkin, the trainer of the Avangarda, speaking about preparing his team for a regular CPL championship match, noted that the militia conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the magnetogorian Metallurg.
The specialist stressed that Avangardu needs to be given more attention to the defence game.
We watched a video of a match against the magnetogorian Mathallurg, and we bring up the official Avangarda site of Chebaturkin's words.
- We missed a lot of chabs, not a very nice moment.
They missed because of their mistakes because of the failure to perform the game job.
We knew the rival had a performer.
They've had five attacks on their statistics, three of them killed us.
It's a very good reality.
Have these mistakes been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
With the guys, we get a good deal of each match, we're talking after the game, we're ready for a new competition.
The main thing is to make the installation work.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against the Metallurg.
The game assignment was done, and the score was 2:0.
We missed the head in the paddle, and in the third period, we started to make mistakes.
Given the difficulty of playing, I saw no point in connecting the defenders.
Defense must be done by the whole team.
Now the Avangard has a long home series, the matches go in the day, and the team's got tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to implement its moments and perform the game task.
Hokkey is an emotional game, if you're doing an installation, it's not that hard.
Because of the new rules imposed by Russian Customs, hundreds of vans have been in line for almost a week on the border with Russia.
Today, the donor officials pledged to provide drinking water and biotualites
At the border points, hundreds of urans were gathered at the entrance to Russia.
This situation has arisen as a result of the change in Customs rules for the handling of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officials confirm that the turn creates a Russian party that has not warned of innovation in advance.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by Deputy Chief of East Customs, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The passpoints are intensified.
FACTOV correspondent visited the border and communicated with the long-range fighters who were hostage to the situation.
Prices in the road cafeteria shop at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are rising every day, as is the fuhr turn.
The trucks stand several rows, stretching about two miles [2 km].
The Novazovsk Customs Terminal - Weselo-Vasket provides one of the most important routes from south of Ukraine for international highways.
From there, goods are shipped to the Stavropolian edge of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, until midnight, these rules were released, and the cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan has been transported through Russia by a photograph of the killer Alexei Gostanov, who has spent almost a week in his car.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which it is transported.
Minimum insurance is 4.5-5,000 roubles (about 1100 - 1,100 Grim).
Those who go nearby (such as Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo of up to $50,000 pay some 15,000 roubles (3,800 roubles) and pass.
And the others stuck -- no one has that big money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries only $4,000 but still in Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (at least 23,000 rubles) to pay for the transit!
The conditions for surviving on the border are none, the far-reachers, who are set up to eat by their cars.
At border stores and cafes, it's always expensive, but prices like here, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers oriented and promptly summoned them: 15 grivines stand for the bathon, seven griven cups of coffee, and 25 griven dishes of soup.
And the cafeteria is alone.
There's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the stairs, we're going to the bathroom.
No washing, no birching...
I can't get out of the car for a week. My wife made it all up.
Victor Scotranko, another long-range fighter, is comforting for a week.
Does my car get the line in a week?
Why do you have one and a half litre of water?
There's 11 and 15 grains.
What, a bottle of crystal or water on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take something for the time that there's something else, it's a seller.
After the media began to highlight the plight of Ukrainian drivers, the authorities in the region were drawn to the attention of the authorities.
The leadership of the Amvrovia and the Novazi paradise administrations has been entrusted to ensure that all who are in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, are provided by the Acting President, Donetska, of the Dergun Oil Authority.
The ambulance team is now on the checkpoints.
Biotualites will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the issue of turns will be resolved in the coming days.
As reported by the Donetska Olgosсад Administration, as at 31 October, 32 vehicles and 68 vehicles were simplified in the international crossings of Spanka and Novoazovsk, respectively.
“FACTS” will monitor the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in trying to slander the Lithuanian President.
Russia intends to implement information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and East Partnership countries - such a statement was made by the BNS Agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow intends to “speak” the President of Lithuania Dal Gribauskait and publish the falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarhiva which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the Special Service, the Department of Public Administration Analysis of Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is conducting the preparation of the information attack.
The structure is headed by Eugenius Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
It is also alleged that a member of the operation is a member of Department W. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smyrnov, under the cover of the scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Smirnova is now prohibited from entering the country.
The President of Lithuania, Gribauskite, said that he knew about the information she was preparing.
In her view, the success of Lithuania ' s presidency in the Council of the European Union and “the aspirations of the country for energy independence” were the main reasons.
The Lithuanian leader had not previously unanimously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus stated that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was “not sufficiently respectful”.
In addition, Gribaukaita was accusing Head of the RF Vladimir Putin of “one claims only” to Lithuania.
Remember, in September, Rosmodnazzar suspended the import of Lithuanian "mills" to Russia.
The quality of the product was reported to be inconsistent with epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not lift the ban, the Government should prepare a request to WTO.
In the United States, the school director fired teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools of adolescents literally caused despair.
The man said he had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to New York Post, young bullies threw a man's home with toilet paper.
As a result, the school principal opened a teenage shooting, which resulted in several wounds in the leg and a 15-year-old boy received his hand.
Since the gangsters were not owned by the Director, he was charged with an attack under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison at $125,000 bail.
Notice, the shooting of civilians in the United States becomes a terrible pattern.
It was literally before the man opened the shooting in the center of Ridgecrest in California, U.S. state, right across the street.
After that, the offender took two random passersby hostage, hid them in the car trunk and tried to escape.
Previously, a shooting was opened in Newtown primary school, Connecticut.
At school, Adam's mother worked, and she was a teacher.
Shots at American school: 14-year-old girl wounded
A further shooting incident took place on 31 January at the American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candys, late in bed, and make masks for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a scar.
I have not been called upon to distribute the candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I'm probably not going to be there this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow with respect to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — namely, 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, suits and ornaments.
The only thing that I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent will go to suits.
This year, sexually unhealthy objects are at the top of the fashion.
Women are no longer obliged to be sexual professionals; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies because of the "The Honey Dead," and I'm sure the Daft Punk astronauts will go into our Instagram tape this year.
According to Google, suits that most often look for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We put our dogs on last year, and to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, the Americans will spend $330 million this year on domestic animal suits.
That means a lot of ridiculous hot dogs.
When it comes to a confetta, we don't care.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about £600 million of Hershey chocolate, lazy, Milk Duds, Twizzlers chewing monkeys, and Clark Bar's batons.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Commerce, this is excellent news for 41 million children who require a confetus who have been prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we'll buy and -- we won't deceive ourselves -- eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is corn-shaped candy; yet, according to the National Conduit Association, nearly £35 million is sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I still have to figure out.
Nothing so expresses Halloween's essence as ghost houses.
They have fascinating names, such as “Awake behind the walls” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “War and Crying” and “The House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes with ghosts that generate about $500 million of income, as well as the amazing pictures that you almost described, which your friend put on Facebook, and you can't take away, and then the guy you like, sees this picture and leaves a comment like the classic expression of your face.
And we'll end up talking about the tips.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Ticva when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's lamp is like a decoration of Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the baby in the pouch only started last year because of Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pots.
Jack's lighter, slowly leaning on your wing, probably came from the state of Illinois, which grew £542 million this year.
If you want a more complicated job, visit Tim and Susan Matisdon in the city of Napa state of California and try to cut out any of their pots weighing £2032.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Estonia rehabilitated after the attack on Ukrainian hackers
The site of the Estonian Ministry of Defence is rehabilitated after the morning cyberattack, reports the press service of the department.
According to the Minoborene viceman on information and administrative matters of Tymar Petersopon, this was a primitive attack, the site just overloaded a lot of requests.
Our specialists have made rapid progress, and the site has been restored to date.
"Damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Peterkop to the Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it's early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will certainly examine the causes of the incident and make our findings of it, but it is not possible to prevent such incidents,” he admitted.
In fact, on 1 November, the group Anonymous Ukraine launched an attack confirming the hacker attack on the Estonian Minoborna and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We shouldn't be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukrainian doesn't need Russia.
Ukraine should not be any slave.
We are in favour of Ukraine, independent.
“Rooks Aside from Ukraine”, says Anonymous.
The Ukrainian Minoбороna had previously reported that the company of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian marine infantry would participate in the command-based training of the NATO response force Stadfast Jazz-2013.
A number of schools and hospitals had to be closed because of the bullying of unclean force.
Four schools in the South Matabelland Province of Zimbabwe had to be closed because the students were attacked... Goblins.
As the local elder explained, the children were panicful, and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The Goblin story can be sounded as an idea of a child for the European, but in Africa it is a serious argument to close school.
Adults also fear unclean strength.
In summer, for example, the hospital closed in Zimbabwe because the hospital had also been attacked by Goblins.
Issuance of the Land Rover racing series
Inside are racing seats and six-point belts, as well as internal communications.
Additionally, modernized brakes are available, a package of services providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between activities.
Drew Bowler, director of the Bowler Motorsport company, said: “Ralley's turns to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced persecutors, but people seeking anxieties, adventures and access to world class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, and to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally Ride.
We were very pleased to develop a Defender Challenge — a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The Russian Forces are not aware of the Brat Cluster - New Ouvement
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the RF.
“After the media reported on the introduction by the Ministry of Finance of the United States of America of Leps into the checklists on suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian criminal syndicate 'Bracy', we have reviewed all the databases, but such a group has not been found,” said the agency interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information has contributed to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which was allegedly operating abroad.
As previously written, the U.S. Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bracy.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
It's on the list as "Grisha," they put it on the day before.
They coincide with the popular Russian artist.
The exact name is Grigory Lepsevridze, the creativity, the place and the date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five more people were mentioned.
Two Russians, Israeli nationals, Uzbek nationals and another resident of the former USSR whose nationality is not specified.
In the United States, it is certain that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, transported money to gangsters by order.
A photograph of the singer and all of its data, which are valid, are attached to the communication.
Moreover, Leps really just bought a house in Phuguette.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
The man's black listings in the United States of America entail the blocking of his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with people living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikov stated that no notifications to the singer were received: “It is difficult to answer the question whether it is the Grigory that everyone is talking about in connection with a scandal in the United States.”
All that Leps knows is media information.
There were no personal notices to him, although I don't know if they were in such cases.
"And of course, that's all, on the one hand, ridiculous, and on the other, amazingly and unexpectedly," she said to the RIA Newsty.
According to her, Gregory Leps does not live in Phuguette, but, according to the U.S. Minfin, he has a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now on a long tour in the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during his journey to the city of evangelizers.
Fugitive in the Shinnik field
Some details were made known about the character of the fan who escaped in the field during the match 1/16 final Russian Cube between the Yaroslav Shinnik and the Moscow Spartak.
As Arthur Grigorianz, the head of the CDC RFC stated, referring to data from the IMD, this is Moscow.
He's under arrest at the moment.
“In addition, Gregoryanz described how a fan had managed to break into the field:” It was discovered that the given one, called his spectator, went to an ambulance, escorting two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to an ambulance -- that's what the doctor confirmed for us.
Then he pushed the two escorts away and ran to the field.
He fled from the East and South Tribune corner to the East and North rostrum.
He ran through the whole field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sport Act, this is a stewards area - the police cannot intervene in what is on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, crossed the East Tribune.
And the riots began in the East Tribune and on the runways," said the head of the KDC.
Remember that the decision of the KPC, Moscow Spartacus, will carry out the forthcoming meetings of the 15th tour of the Russian Championship v. Lockomotive and Zenita, as well as a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire teams were summoned to save the lost cheek that stuck at a height of 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous quarry in a career
Rubie's coker-song fled after she got into a small accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in her career.
The firemen came down on the rope on the bulk to save the dog from the imminent loss.
The puppy was fortunately saved after fire teams were summoned to raise it and to take it to a safe place after it had somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous stalemate of the weighing slope.
Rubie, a nine-month-old coker, ran away after he hit the car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before he was rescued from his career on Wednesday.
Her master, Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Fleppit's career in Denholm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire firefighting service.
They were fiercely looking for their missing dog and putting on social networks after she ran into a career after a small accident.
Approximately at 14:15 on Wednesday, a star dog guide noticed Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet per quarry.
A technical rescue unit from the Clekhiton fire station hurried to the scene of the accident, descended down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a transfer to lift it up the slope.
Andy Clayton, Rescue Officer, said, “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the weighing slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move her muscular while she's saved, she's completely frozen.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said, "The Roby is very lucky that she was saved."
It was likely that she could get a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was found that she was all right, except for depletion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Galifax, West Yorkshire, said, “It was scary to observe salvation.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinary said that if she had been weakened and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The fires were great.
That was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of the town of Kitley added: “We feared that it might fall, but it remained there.”
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview on the Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a bec-ocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a Veteran Rocker and said, "He played with me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the seventieth-year-old Jagger said that he “was in the categorically denying that he had ever been taunting Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps it confuses someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as visitors to the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new Prism album was debuted first this week.
George Kereven: A breakthrough with Europe gives Scottish people a choice.
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time, we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the Pan-European Free Movement Zone as a condition for membership in the EU.
The past stories of passport control in Bervik and the barbed wire along Adrianov's wal.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movements in the rest of Europe, although — which is predictable — it was not in the headlines.
Nor did none indicate that EU member countries spend much time turning their formal rules back in a way that is convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen Zone, continued non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels in return to what he really wanted from Scottish people.
So it's not a worthless story.
And so old that it has become fascinating: for the first time, I heard a Student that “dependence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
Still, there is an interesting moment lost in the story of an ancient story.
Why does independent Scotland have to obey European orders at all?
Why change London’s yoke to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the big post-war plan to unite Europe finally stuck.
Europe is officially dead with Eurocrisis.
Throughout the European Union, parties against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining force.
Even in Germany, the “Alternative for Germany” party, based only this year, emerged from nowhere and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus, in fact, the “Free Democrats” (the “Liberal Democrats”) from Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The rigid savings imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the trenches imposed on national economies through a single currency, led many to the idea that Europe had gone too far.
The crisis of the euro is very little because national Governments are working with excessive budget deficits — it was just for Greece alone.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters — that German policies and want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, South Europe is in a preconditional disadvantage in terms of productive opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salary and public expenditure, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currencies pose a deeper challenge to European productive capacities.
As a result of a set of green energy measures introduced by Brussels, a cipher representing the subsidy of French and German energy companies by the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times as gas in the United States.
It's a paralyzingly unfavourable price environment, as we've seen in Grangmut.
No salaries freeze in the world will stop the destructive victory of cheap US lanks over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a revolt, especially in France, once the EU's very strong supporter.
After the war, the French political elite viewed the EU as a way of controlling Germany and putting Paris to one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destructive economy of France in a plight.
The result was the right party against the EU, Marine Le Pén National Front, just won the decisive additional elections, throwing the ruling party of socialists to the third place.
The Frente is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the votes, a timely warning to British lieborists that it is not possible to assume that the division of the right will automatically affect the left-wing.
What makes Le Pen with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If, and this is very likely, the parties against the EU will receive support in these elections, such a cluster will be able to take up the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my view that the fast-growing moods against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will salt together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a kind of vague “Europe (spoiled) nations” that General de Hollu liked.
Germany and several economies depending on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I believe that Great Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to draw close to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will remain unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within a more free European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other single-minded countries would be easier in non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider the possibility of repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, strangely, the most successful political movement in Europe against the rigid savings that received an impressive majority of votes in 2011 because of objections to the reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Leiborist Chancellor of Treasment by Alyster Darling and subsequently a coalition of Tori and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take measures of rigid savings imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Sexual Age: Ageing Before
Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexuality is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the early sexual abstract mechanisms.
The trend towards early sexual maturity is not the same for boys
Former correspondent CNN Pat Eterij, a journalist specializing in child health and family matters.
Should mothers be frightened if her daughter begins to form breastbearings and raise lobby hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week, in Orlando, Florida, child endocrineologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time resting my parents, ” said Caploittz.
Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobbying and mirth hair and body smell, appear before girls.
But there was only a small shift between menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and declined from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the development of the breast, at least two or three years before the Menarche, ” said Caploittz, also author of the book “Sexual Agreed for Girls: How to Resist this prevalent problem.”
Time is the most accurate check of how sexuality will progress.
Discussion is under way on what constitutes actual sexual adulthood, but is considered “previous” when the increase in breasts is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop is that the pediatrician can be closely monitored.
Fast progress can be a basis for endocrinologist analysis to address serious problems, such as tumors or bones.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and to prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which may ultimately lead to slow growth and low adult growth.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Caplovitz is careful with the drugs, but admits that “sexual development can mitigate behavioural problems and the feeling of girls that they are different from peers”.
Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can deal with hygiene, ” said Caploittz.
“ It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter had a menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset because she was the first of her friends.
There are many declared theories about the causes of early sexual maturity.
Nonetheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are guilty.
Boys, like girls, have sex sooner.
The Caplovitz claims that the assumption that has the greatest weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links fat to sexual maturity.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other conducive factors.
In that country, Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Globally, early sexual maturity is likely to affect all, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
It is also a mystery: While boys have hair on their faces and on their foreheads at a younger age, the tendency to have full early sexual maturity is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and infants of arsenic age have the emergence of jumping and lobby hair.
“We must be careful about how we determine the true sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Horeb Child Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from the pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
“This may mean an earlier than expected conversation,” explained Caploittz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who flourish early need to confirm that even when this happens earlier, this process is a normal part of life.
American Boeing is preparing for the flight
An unplanned United States aircraft operating under the Open-Sky Treaty flying over Russia's territory and landing an unplanned aircraft in Chile on Friday, 1 November, in 8:30 by Moscow time would leave an air harbour of the city.
The airport administration allowed the flight of the boat with the money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the aircraft will fly off to Ulan Woode.
According to other data, he's going to go to the United States.
An aircraft in Ulan Woode was reported to land in the Zabayqala province due to a mist.
He was not released from Chile airport because of unpaid accounts.
30 people, including the crew, spent two nights on the airport, reported by ITAR TASS.
As reported in the MID RF, under the terms of the Open-Sky Treaty, persons on board aerial vessel are not entitled to outside the airport of Chile, they can undergo border control at only two Russian airports in Cuban and Ulan Woode.
The Open-Sky Treaty was signed in 1992 and 34 States are participating.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the promotion of transparency, the promotion of arms control agreements, the enhancement of crisis prevention and crisis management within OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do late celebrities earn - IK in the United States of America
The rating of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 led Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But she was overwhelmed by deceased Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
The other celebrities who have lost their lives, who have earned a few jobs last year, are very much behind him.
The second one on the list of the most “sustainable” celebrities produced by Forbes after the year was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and a figure below was written by Peanuts Charles Schulz, 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a leader (25 million), and Bob Marley (18 million), entered the first fifth.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein were also listed.
In Moscow, the first beek, Igora Gulaev, opened
On 23 October, the opening of the first flagship bee, Igor Gulayeva, in Moscow, took place.
The designer Igor Gulayev is known to the general public for his beautiful pieces of mechanical luxury.
And now they'll be able to evaluate even more fashion fans -- in Moscow, finally, the first beetle opened up, why the designer and set up a dolce vita party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I'm especially glad I had a shop open in Moscow.
It's not just a office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
With that, Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... to illustrate the models he looked up!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are in jeopardy of the width of the seat when large orders are placed on the horse
There was an intense dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist-class seats on the long-range flights, giving the tone of an aggressive confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The spontaneous spores are rotating around the width of the seats provided on the long-range flights to the economy class, whose interests are not always at the centre of the airlines, while the amount of space assigned to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the latest airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a sectoral standard that would include a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy class, but its main American Boeing competitor says that this should be decided by the airline.
The controversy is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of more and more large versions of their two-motor highway aircraft and potential record orders are expected for 17-21 November.
The componing of the rear of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 are situated on a row, is central to the economic performance of the new projects of Mini-aerobus.
Boeing asserts that its updated 777X will contain 406 seats in economic class more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus says that its competing version A350 will be transported to an economy class of 350 people in 18 inches wide, 9 inches in row.
The aircraft gigants often exchange technical impacts through advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now directing the public to the Dubai airport, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
It has recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could start by showing the financiers a slide that depicts three people in a restaurant that is clenched to each other, entitled “Would you agree to it?”
“Boeing offers far-ranging flights on seats narrower than regional turbovintic aircraft,” said the sales manager of Airbus John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people take weight, but plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when broad-füsel Boeing 747 set standards for advanced travel, the average American man aged 40 to 49 had increased by 10 per cent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American man ' s wagon in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average coverage of those recently referred to as “reactive public” has already been made.
Airbus said that it had commissioned a study that an additional inch in the width of the seat would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing challenges airbus's seat size figures and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions about how airlines balance tariffs and conveniences.
According to her study, the convenience of the salon is not limited to the width of the seat.
“Everything is really about making choices to the airlines and doing what they believe they should do to succeed,” said Boeing specialist at the Kent Craver Salons.
They don't want us to decide what will bring them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is to increase space side by side, but for suppliers it is increasingly a factor that can influence profits.
This dispute is followed by an airplane commission race, estimated at least at $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades, sufficient to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the Reuters Agency reported for the first time in July, the location of seats is exactly what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability to one place in their last two-month long-range models compared to the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of 10-local series 777X with the original 9-local series of constructive decision 777.
The gains are declining at a cost compared with the 10-local layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to compress more seats and make its plane more competitive than our development,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that 10-local salons for existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer density, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The day of eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, airbus's proposal is due to the threat posed by the 777th model,” said the interior expert on the Mary Kirby salon, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World travelers of jet jet sales even carry rudders to verify competing plans.
All manufacturers also offer a very tight airline composite aircraft for budget airlines and regional flights in a comfortable manner.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-local rows, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Until recently, airbus stressed the need for further modifications of salon salons, offering wider passages on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other producer of major modern aircraft, the experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “leave”, but may distract attention from the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the process of smoking of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive cigarette smoking of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine dependence on life.
Further tests are needed before the beginning of human tests, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Cristall of Wayll Cornell Medical College in New York stated that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to abandon all market practices today but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of antinicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable antibodies flow.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing nicotine stroke from smoking.
vaccinated mouses, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that was not given the vaccine was “relaxed”, and this is a sign that nicotine came to their brains, the researchers say,
These experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injectings had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette to prevent nicotine dependence.
More likely, though, it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not be satisfied with this because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit, ” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they warned that further research was needed.
Oleinikov: Third of the villages of Pozmoskovia are fully subtracted
The Vice-Governmentor of Pozmoskaya Yury Oleiniko stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were totally dotted
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
The income ratio of 122 rural settlements is more than 50 per cent and 83 per cent dotted.
Within the framework of the budget, some 25 billion roubles are being dispatched from the provincial budget," said Oleiko.
The Vice Governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mitches, Single and Pushkino - have a budget income of over 1 billion roubles for 2013.
Income from rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million roubles, “this is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining a local administrative apparatus in 88 villages in Posmoskovia is over 70 per cent, “and the quality of services has been reduced,” noted Oleiniko.
It had previously commissioned the heads of municipalities of the Sub-Moskovia by the end of November to consider what settlements needed to be increased, united in urban districts or change the administrative system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Before that, the Governor of the Moscow region stated that the administrative reform in Pozmoskje planned to reduce the number of subsidiary rural settlements.
Also in Khayrski, Kashiri, Solar-Horse, Kolomen, Ljuverz and Cotton, there is a request for the expansion of municipalities.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
The President of Mossoudama Igor Brinzalov also stated that some 30 rural settlements in 12 submoskjaya areas were planned to be united within the framework of the forthcoming Admreform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Pozmoskovier, less than a third have a “acceptable” financial base and 100 dotting.
Diana Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not conceal the great pleasure she receives from the upbringing of her children.
Even though it is right now that Arbenina is especially time-consuming for creativity and public activities, she is still able to ride with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their training but also enjoying as much as she can.
During the last week, Diana twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
First, she put in Facebook a picture that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday I chatted the fans, showing how Artema and Martha were putting on Halloween.
To the bat races are ready, our first Halloween" -- so named Diana a photograph of her kids dressed in the holiday suits.
What's unwise is that they're like any other Russian boys and girls, because they're born in America.
Germany is the first to introduce “undefined sex” when registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to sign “undefined” when registering children born of Germanphrodites, instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right for time to leave the field in the birth certificate.
For "F" (woman) or "M" (human sex) parents may write "H" (undefined).
This decision aims not to push the parents to hastily a gender-dependent operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born Germanphroditus.
The Trinity denies that Obeid's influence is susceptible to
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the investigation of the anti-corruption oversight body in that state.
Former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, challenges the change in the lease of the navy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, secretly owning the share of three real estate sites in the public land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday to see whether Mr. Obeid was lobbied by several state ministers for extending the lease contract to Serkülar Ki, where the Obeid family belonged to two restaurants and a café, without a tender following their expiration in August 2005.
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret participation in real estate facilities, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi Linn Ashpoul, former Deputy Head of Administration on Thursday.
During the several years of the discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be presented for an open competition.
The renters opposed this and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, lease contracts in Serkülar Ki, which offered the Obeid family some $2.5 million a year, were extended without being presented for an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who had been the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 until November 2009, originally advocated open competitions.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as acknowledged by Mr. Tripodi, urged that the Government ' s lease policy be amended.
The ICAC telephone interviews were discussed in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the question discussed in these telephone conversations a question of the development of commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wili, Mr. Tripodi.
“No, ” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was being discussed, but that was definitely the wrong thing.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-level official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
Fox News, a high-ranking official of the Administration, confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked the target in the Syrian port city of Latacia on Thursday night.
The defendant did not specify what the purpose was, but said that at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose was to launch Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carved airlines on missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers can be tested for “dependence”
The “validity” test for 457 foreign visas workers is under consideration by the Government, as it indicates an increase in repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied to the criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas of Class 457 to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole to move the family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Leiborist deputy Maxine McKew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia ' s neighbours.
“Great declarations like “foreigners — at the end of the line” and “working for Australians” are a very unpleasant turn to times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said to the Australia - India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that it was the white work that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper before the discussion sets out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under review.
If the “validity” criteria are adopted, the applicant for a visa may be examined for “whether the candidature is genuine in conditions where the candidate is a relative or a close friend of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise”.
Businesses may also require to report according to the number of visas holders of subclass 457, since they have previously sponsored a small number of employees and then received hundreds of jobs.
Meanwhile, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers died allegedly of an infarct following their arrival on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man was murdered on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he was supported by a cousin who was also on board a ship.
The Australian authorities hurriedly sent a man to the Christmas Hospital where he died.
A friend of Simeon Varlamov stated that Hokkeist suffers from alcoholism
A friend of Hokkeist Simeon Varlamova Eugenia Vavrinyuk stated that he suffered from alcoholism, transmits the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” said a woman in particular.
Recall that Vavrinuk brought to the court for being beaten on a holkiper of the assembly of Russia by Simeon Varlamov, also a member of the Collorado Club.
She said that the hokkeist had pushed her over her hair and beat her hands, breast, stomach, and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself came to Denver's police and confessed to be beaten in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at 5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements across the country, but prohibited the approach to Vavrinuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at enhancing the economic impact of Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 involves opening a high-speed communication with Scotland and North England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 2026
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project would “unit Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said that he was “in delight” with the prospect of working on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Phase is completed, the lines will be located in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British Government, which negotiated with Scotland Transport, mandated HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduced travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgo and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said: “Our objective for HS2 is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other”.
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face the crisis of capacity in our railway network.
But it is also the transport of cities to each other; 18 cities throughout the United Kingdom, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will receive better communication through HS2.
Scottish Secretary Alister Carmajkle added: “Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmaikla “equivocally” to support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The High-speed Railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland's economic weight to the general reasoning for high-speed railway across Britain”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, to create benefits for all and to continue the Glasgo Railway, Edinburgh, already planned by the Scotland Government.
I look forward to considering the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and to taking a joint decision on the following steps.
Tory is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Incineration of hydrocarbons (where they are) adversely affects climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large spaces for generation.
The atomic energy is costing no more than that, but it leaves a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to a torium, another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It occurs around the world, and experts claim that its dissolution does not leave waste that must be kept for centuries.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia for the time being in force
Australian airline passengers will have to continue to dismantle their planchets and smartphones during the flight and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play on their devices during the flight and landing, provided that they remain in the flight control.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and landing.
Australian carriers were considering this decision, which required the United States airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they did not intend to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases still existed in Australia.
“The Office of Civil Aviation Safety at present does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft,” it stated.
This issue is governed by the rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety rules they are being informed by the crew.
The company Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system, had not opposed the changes but had stated that it would follow the direction of the controller.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of permitting the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer services now that it (the battalion wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” said the Spokesman.
Qantas stated that it would adhere to the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during flight and landing, and we are not about to change it in the near future,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study the decision of the OPS and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the influence of the regulation would vary from airlines to airlines and depend on the age of their airport.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft have a resilience to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, manual storage standards and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms the disturbance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic instruments, such as planshets, electronic books and smartphones at any height,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off its devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be situated under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during the offshore and landing.
The head of Daghestan hears a note of extremism in the hymn of Cubani
The Football match between Anji and the Cuban was a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Daghestan after the painkillers burned the Dagestan flag, and the hymn Cubani sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday, invited the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court because the hymn of the Redodar Land allegedly appealed to the international division, in particular calling for war with the “basurmans”.
Take the hymn of the Krasnodar province, which is now approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Then, remembering you as a mother of your family, an enemy, we go to the basurman, and we go to the death battle, for which we have to put these words in a hymn, to chase some of the believers against the other believers," - said the President of the Parliament, Hizry Shihsaids, as a solidarity with Abdulatyp.
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Asada
Now, the news is about the ocean, namely, from Syria, where, as we now know, Israel attacked Russian-producing missiles, reportedly designed by Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition of destroying its production of chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached under the mediation of Russia and allowing the United States not to carry out a military operation to which it was approached this summer.
More about the weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will tell us about our principal international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said Asada's regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed by poisoning gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Asada's friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will refuse its chemical weapons by the middle of the following year.
And today is an important milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn the reported chemical production factories.
The longer-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Asada's days were counted.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He's not a legitimacy anymore, and he has to leave.
But Asad stays.
And it feels more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and navals.
His opponents are fragmented and ill-armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Asad escaped the punishment for massacres.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was called the success of diplomacy, the Inspectors had awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Asaad himself had an impressive effect on a person ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is unlikely to be more easily killed by chemical weapons.
Asad is still holding.
And it changes the weapon to power.
The President of the RF has established a separate Ministry of Construction and LCH
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, established a new Ministry of Construction and MCH and proposed to lead his ex-Gubernator, Mikhail ' s area, in the process of the personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in a New Ogarevo residence, and I did not refuse to head the new office.
The Spokesman for the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all construction and MCH functions were transferred to the new Ministry from the Minority.
Mikhail Man, the son of a prominent Orthodox priest who was a protoiere of Alexander Me, completed the Moscow Institute of Petrochemia on the name of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow District Duma of Serbia-Posada, a deputy of the State Duma, the first Vice-President of the Government of Moscow, the Vice-President of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanova region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is having difficulties
In a lambard at the Bendemir Trade Centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthaling is building a gold bracelet, ring, and earrings to pay for her daughter's schooling.
“My husband and I just bought the house, so that all my money is invested there, ” says Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 per month as administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not sufficient, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, is such that the ValueMax, where it deals, this week has become a third brokerage registered at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Loan on the bail of jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S $1,100 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
The annual interest rate in Singapore is usually 17% more than 15.4% proposed in the United overseas Bank office, a local creditor with an affiliate at the same trading centre.
However, lambards have the advantage that they do not require a check of creditworthiness or evidence of wages and can issue credits faster than banks.
For this reason, millions of people throughout the region are being targeted because families are pressured because of the higher cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the world financial crisis and low-cost loans supported by free monetary policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are converted into lambards to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's, rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt ratio to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list from 80 per cent of GDP as compared with 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely left the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued declines in exports and lower consumer demand.
“The fact is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income scales] will look for ways to replenish their income wherever they can”, says Song Seng Won, a CIMB economist, of the Malaysian Bank.
Highly high gold prices over the past two years have increased the haste with which people lay their personal belongings because they use the opportunity to get money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items in 200 Lombard States are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold is good, let's put a golden chain of grandmother and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest EasyMoney Lombard operator observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
Growth in the Lombard Business is such that the ValueMax, the Bendemir office operator and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where he owns four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Ling, Executive Director ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million involved this week as a result of the holding of the Singapore stock.
While some creditors caused criticism at high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the lombard was not only offering cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it did not increase the debt directly.
“The clients have already owned items and the coining of personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The foundation gains wider public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
At the same time, the lombards do not only benefit from the categories of people in a difficult financial situation.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax branches to form gold or Rolex clocks, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase costs in cash.
We see clients from all sectors of society.
“These include wealthy persons who need to take money for short periods for commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important for the population not for the number of available medical facilities and their status but for the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the Tulles Health Modernization Programme 2011-2013, the reorganization of our city's medical institutions will provide an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological, pregnant and childhood patients.
For example, there has been an additional opportunity to engage the NHRI narrow specialists to consult pregnant women with different pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistical base of the maternity home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards has emerged.
During those years, approximately 8 million roubles have been allocated for major renovation facilities, and 112 items of 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The Cel-Saver unit is used in the operation of the Caesarean section, which allows the blood to be collected from the operational wound and, after special treatment, to be returned to the baby, avoiding transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical lab diagnosis.
Electronic registers are in operation in the Women ' s Consultation, and the introduction of electronic maps and stories of patient illness is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has led to the possibility of consultation among gynaecological patients, pregnant women, mothers and newborns with provincial professionals.
Chechens beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya's villages are arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March this year.
Approximately 60 women were complaining about the acts of the Caucasus.
The gangsters reportedly ordered prostitutes to a stasburg hotel and then beat them and robbed them.
The gang leader was 27 years old, formerly convicted Chechnya.
The Bavariya Protector David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, reports the official Bundesliga site.
In this dispute, he has preceded winter sports, which are traditionally the best in the country.
Marcel Hirser took the second place, and the third was a skiing skier from Gregor Schlirenzauer.
During the last season, the 21-year-old Austrian Philippine-Nigeria origin helped his team to win the League of Championships, the German Championship and the Cube, as well as the Supercube of UEFA.
Arshavin's ex-wife rests with Actor Andrey Chadov
The former civilian wife of Pieter Zenita, Andrey Arshavin Yulia Baranowska, is taking leave with Actor Andrey Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy in an actress company of Anastasia Westya, her fiancée, Sergei Slavnova, and Andrea Chadow's actor.
Cooperative strolls are published in Instagram Anastasia Westya.
It's not the first joint photograph of Andrey and Julia.
On 5 October, the Satellite published a picture on which a couple should hug up on the Gulf of Finnish in Komarov.
In mid-October, the Habek Zenita, Andrey Arshavin, admitted that he lived separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranowska and Andrea Arshavin had been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently been known that Arshavin meets with the ex-model Alica Kazmina.
A new friend of Arshavin was married to a top manager of the corporation.
325 million rescue package for Tasmania health
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the weakened health system in Tasmania will be supplemented with rigid conditions that guarantee that the State Government will not waste waste.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersse, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “term measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the higher level of chronic diseases and the system ' s limitations.
The decision to finance for four years was taken following the Government ' s consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” said Ms. Pliberssek.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the Planned Operations Table.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic operations and cataract disposal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
Money is also available for hospitals that receive unaccounted for patients in Hobart and Lonseston to improve the quality of care after stationary, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will be based on the ideas made by advanced doctors on how best to help Tasmania's health system,” said Ms. Pliberszek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and responsibility.
The State would need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive the Commonwealth cash and report monthly on where it was spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would be unresolved, “unless genuine reform will follow them, which would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal assistance package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state's health system from critical condition,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures would greatly compensate for recent reductions.
But the Federal Opposite Health Representative Peter Dotton believes that today's statement is a “decision similar to the leukoplaster”.
“The reason we are here is that the Leiborist State Government has pulled $430 million from the health system”, he said to the ABC TV.
When the state government blows off nearly half a million dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million dollars, it is not to be pretended to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersse to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue package would be spent on an additional bureaucracy.
The screening of Guillaume Nicklu novel Denis Didro can be an exceptional design and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
The film in France in the 1760s tells Susannah’s gloomy story, a young aristocratic woman sent to the monastery of her family.
When she starts rebellious, she's subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the hordes and become the object of erotic fantasies to others.
The film never falls to the departure or sensation — and that is the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story is likely to be a test like the wax and the audience.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons manufacture, said the observer group
Syria destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poisoning ammunition, declared on Thursday an international monitoring group, while violent clashes burst in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
Statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization, to destroy or “incapacitate” all chemical weapons production and mechanisms to mix chemicals with poisoning gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is expected to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nervous gas.
This statement was made during the heavy fights on Thursday in Safira, where the experts considered that there was a chemical weapon-producing facility, as well as its storage site, reports the Syrian Centre for Human Rights Protection, based in Britain.
The activist group, which tracked the loss through a network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of that number, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
For the Government, the group stated that 29,944 persons are members of the President ' s Armed Forces of Bashar Asad, 18,678 are pro-governmental militants and 187 Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as reported in the statement, were 2,202 Armenian rivals and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Asaad's warrior fought in Safire for several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that the victims on Thursday were on both sides, but did not provide specific data.
Boys stressed the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors by the time frame of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the wake of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and seen the destruction of all critical means of production and equipment for mixing/refiling by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Previously this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first inspection round, visiting 21 of the 23 sites announced by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two seats for security reasons, and the inspectors stated that they were not able to visit them.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both places were, according to the Syrian statement, “sunk and... objects of the chemical weapons programme located in them were moved to other declared sites which were verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site in Safire was one of the two places that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage you all have shown in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumjo, Chief Observer Group Director in the OPCW commentary.
For the third year, civil war has been confronted by rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Asad and its security forces, which are composed of members of its alavitic sect, the response of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a severe explosion on the environment at the air defence site in the coastal province of Syria, Latacia.
The reason for the explosion is unknown, he said.
Due to the conviction of the organizers of the terrorists in Bali
The 202 survivors and relatives of the 202 victims of the Bali bombing in 2002 responded angryly to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspiracies brought before the court and stated that Umar Patek was to be shot.
The Patec, who had spent almost 10 years in run as one of the most searched people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in the establishment of explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he is granted parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kut, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and several more wounded.
It was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including the wave of church explosions throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that the man who was called “subverted” for his reputation as an explosive device master should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother from Pert June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the terrorist attack carried out by the Patec and his associates almost ten years ago.
Almost inhibiting her tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really believe he should follow the steps of other guys.
He's got to be in front of the shooting team,' said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched in a parked van outside, immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where the suicide bomber blew up the backpack that was bombed just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into the coma and “miral” three times as he was connected to the lifesaving system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the Jemaa Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the massacre of blood — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imama Saduda, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds, it is not so much.
The Patek is the last of the Bali terrorists to be brought before the court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but eventually he was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, where the American troops killed Usamu bin Laden, former head of Al-Qaida, less than four months later.
During the trial, an Agent of the FBI indicated that the intelligence was evidenced: the Patec was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden in an attempt to restore the links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“He didn't give up,” said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much pain he had caused other people.
The sentence was issued in advance of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack to be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Savage passengers are now able to use airplanes (but do not call on a mobile phone)”
Airpassairs will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones — according to the long - awaited new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Authority on Thursday.
But passengers shouldn't expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as this change is realized, it will vary depending on the airline, says FAU administrator Michael Wert at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft are in line with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for the flight crew and the schedule rules in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“ Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” said FAU.
Passengers are now obliged to turn off their smartphones, schedulings and other devices as soon as the airplane door is closed.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives them “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is declining for landing and not to include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic disturbances may allow passengers to use these devices during the offshore, landing and steering, FAU stated.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, President of the Association of Professional Coast Conductors, welcomed these changes.
“When the new policy is successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve it), it will be a winless option,” said Glaiding.
We're frankly tired of feeling "school duty" when it comes to this question.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, sharing e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at altitudes of less than 10,000 feet, reported by the agency.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, planchets and other devices to the airplane.
Thus, no words with friends continue to be the intellectual Internet game in which Alex Boldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the actor was off the American Airlines airlines aircraft for refusing to dismantle the device at the time the plane was off the landing.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the baggage compartment, because they can traumatize someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Mobile phone rings will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory power on telephone calls belongs to the Federal Liaison Commission, not to FAU.
FAU can remove the ban on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Council for Transport Safety, a national expert on CBS News transport safety, stated that cellular phones were still considered to be a risk.
“The cell phones are indeed a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigational devices, but we know, thanks to the FCS, that they can cause disturbances for the cell phones when the plane is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The sectoral advisory committee established by FAU to study this issue recommended last month that the Government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAU has increased to reduce restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Senator-Democrates from Missouri Claire McCashkill state argue that there are no good reasons for security for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began wearing FM-radio-accessors, high-tech gedgets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as resistant to electronic disturbances.
Airlines have been offering the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Modified planes for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disturbances.
The vast majority of the airliners were adapted to broaden the use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Wart.
Today’s electronic devices usually emit radio signals far lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readership devices, for example, emit only minimal signals when translucent pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded a whole airliner with their electronic books reader and flyed on Kindle to verify the problems, but they never found them.
The members of the Consultative Committee of FAU expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Association stated that the interference with the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of those reports were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the pilots be allowed to request passengers to disengage devices during landings under restricted visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step to meet passengers who are now using many technology devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Autoschools will be able to carry out driving rights examinations
Examinations to driving rights will be able to receive private companies with their own computerized automobile.
This is written by Commersant, referring to the draft Government Regulation on the Permission to Control of Vehicles.
According to the newspaper, currently there are only about 30 such dramas in Russia.
The students of such “privileged” schools are expected to count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory examinations and more than 20% of the pupil's courses are not given up on the first time, such school will be deprived of privileges for half a year.
The technical requirements for dramas contained in the draft decision of the Government shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for driving two-wheeled equipment.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will have to pass the test in urban traffic to obtain A rights.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to employ foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird thrown in the air into a safe place from a storm plant in the North Sea is released back into the wild
A bird thrown on the shore after being found in a depleted state on an oil-high in the North Sea was released back into wildlife.
This water pastor was placed in an Aberdin helicopter last month and then in the Scotland Society for the Prevention of Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Abuse Management (SPCA) office in the SPCA Rescue Centre in the Al-Ala.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This is probably a winter migrants from North Europe who are caught in a zone of strong winds above the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has been weakened and has been able to find refuge in the oil jar.
He added: "She was unable to fly again, so they asked us for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the European elite ready to business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to gather business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and employment creaters want to see with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a broad business cut in Britain by size, sector and region.
The findings of the survey will be surprising to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now seeking export opportunities outside Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to waste time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU's confused institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antimonopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the regulators from Brussels now outweighed the benefits of being in the European trade zone, even 40 per cent of the major businesses traditionally the most pro-European-based companies.
The latest and most significant — our business leaders survey found that the obvious majority wanted Britain to undertake a course to change the treaty and relations with the EU based on trade rather than on politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is insisting on a “significant change”, which will return authority to Britain.
Higher rates — the achievement of changes in the treaty and the better conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent shift in voting in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: the survey shows that the British business supports his plan to revise British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The better conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters a closer economic and financial association.
Priority must be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, for business, this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels' normative activities.
U.S. officials are listening to Pope's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the vigilance of the U.S. special services.
New documents from Edward Snouden's collection show that the U.S. intelligence was listening to all the talks of previous Pope Benedict, and now he's very apprehensive to Pope Francisk.
His phone began listening before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also monitored.
What in the United States was of particular importance.
The special service joined the cardinal cell phones that met in Rome to pick up the next pope.
The telephones of the residence where the participants lived were also heard.
The American spies listened to all the main papal candidates to prevent the appearance of undesirable figures on it for Washington.
"Panorama" reports that the U.S. Big Ear continued to intercept prelates until the end of the Conscription on March 12.
It is alleged that the United States has since 2005 identified Argentine Archbishop Bergolio as the future of the Pope of Rome.
The American Intelligence was also subject to negotiations on the election of the new President of the Bank of the Vatican.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Roman Embassy continues to work as a secret team of CIA and ANC operational personnel that obtain information on policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatedly declared that he was not concerned by the American “prosecution”, even if it was occurring.

The Russian Bank issued a memorial note on the city of Sochi on Wednesday, where the Olympic Games will be held in the winter.
The nominal bill is 100 roubles.
But online bloggers are already active about a memorial note.
After a presentation of the Olympic Bulletin on October 30, they noticed that the image of a snouder from a banknet could be found in photobanks.
In particular, in a free photo warehouse of StockExchange, where the photograph is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop class published on the Russian website, Mega Overview, on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it was already used in RugGear's Smartphone ad.
The Olympics note is done in a blue blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snouber flying over Sochi, on the other, a form of the Olympic Stadium and the Jar Ptina.
The designer of the notebook, Paul Bushuev, won the competition among St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports, such as mining, freezing, and jumping from the temple, were considered, but eventually selected as a relatively young sport.
According to the CB source, the regulator is not indifferent to the public ' s view of the widespread dissemination of the image of a snouber from the Olympic banknet and is now studying the situation.
In Gostic, there's no too much concern about the noise around the Olympic note.
The head of the press service of the Lord Natalia Nikiforov stated to "Isvest," that all the arguments about the plagiate are funny.
The banker will return to the right, the photos on the network on the left, she said Nikiforov.
A person on a photo session to create a bill was taken from different locations, and then a final image was selected, and it was characteristic of the outside of a snoubbridge.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic note, since the artist had received wages for work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion on the image on the Olympic Campaign is positive.
Acquaintance with the image on the bill -- plus to move it -- believes the executive director of the NP "Rus Brend" Alexei Povers.
It is difficult to prove a hundred percent similarity to the image on the buyer and in the photobanks, so it is unlikely to be sought to challenge intellectual property in the image.
For the first time, the Olympic Bancot appeared in China, and the Olympic Games in Beijing were released a 10 Yuan note in 2008.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian beer's got a bad mood.
According to their assumptions, beer consumption in the country will remain at the previous level next year, and this will be best.
Although the businessmen originally counted on growth.
After all, the current year is unsuccessful: sales have fallen by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the President of the Council of the Soviet Union of Russian Beverages, Isaac Sheps, at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demand in Russia, which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already declined by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and trafficking of beer, a small alcohol drink, reported to the Sheps audience.
In no country in the world, there is no such restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new non-legal prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer said that many legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse did not exert special influence, but all new initiatives were constantly emerging.
More painfully, the beer manufacturers had hit the ban on selling alcohol in the cyos.
"We lost 35,000 consumers right away," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, two projections are in the beer.
Optimistic is the one that the Sheps spoke of: the sale of the drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic will fall by another 2-3 percent.
In order to maintain their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the class of mass consumers to the "premium" class, and the beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
However, the radical effects of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"In my observations, the level of alcoholism remains roughly the same," said a doctor doctor, Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks has increased, as well as those who have pushed on alcohol-containing drinks like Yaguara, while ten years ago was predominant of "drinky" alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired.
According to trade unions, all prisoners were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region is more acute than the problems of workers.
At the meeting, the Regional Zaksa Alexei Etmanov deputy stated that some 600 people had been cut down at the factory of the Ford Company in the All-World.
He said that this had taken place in September since the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the organization's union, left the factory with some 600 people.
Several salaries were offered to workers who decided to quit their own will.
As a result, the vast majority left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be the case.
However, in the next two years, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programme of support for the proximity businesses”, he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
In the Ford, this information is neither refuted nor confirmed.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it gets up, we're going to publish it.
Talking about the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in the Universe has been a long time ago.
For example, the company ' s plans to dismiss 600 people were known in September.
Previously, the factory had claimed a halt in the production of cars.
The factory was called the declining demand for the "Ford" cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, as a result of the nine months of 2013, industrial production in Lenoblest declined by 5.4 per cent.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobiles can be used during the air and landing of the aircraft
New regulations for the safe use of mobile devices during the air and landing of airliners were approved in the United States, reports BBC Television Corporation.
The U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and planks throughout the journey, and the new rules will be in force by the end of 2013.
Nevertheless, Internet connections to receive and send e-mail will be banned during flights at a height of less than 3 kilometres.
Owing to the risk of interference with the airplane ' s radio equipment, the cellular voice will continue to be banned.
As a result, passengers are allowed to read electronic books, play tablets and other airlines, and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be obliged to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to deal with the estimated impact of mobiles on airlines and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, for example the United States, the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight could also be revised in Britain.
A new name for the Russian Mafia in the U.S. is "Bracy."
This week, the black list of the Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek citizens and an Israeli.
One Russian was the famous singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money for the group members of the United States.
In total, on the U.S. blacklist, 22 persons involved in the Brazilian circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization exists.
The “Bracy” statement is more attempted to combine dissolved criminal groups”, previously said an expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotty of the University of New York.
In his view, the "Bracy" reflects the popular perception of "Russian Mafia".
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anyone else who confirms the existence of such a criminal organization,” quotes Mr. Galeotty, the American Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime Research.
Mr. Galeotty agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shellie University.
“If they act together, it is more like a criminal network but not an organization,” she quotes the Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galleotti suggested that the "Bracy" was bringing together more proximity to the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usojan, known as Dead Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, the activities of Lasha Shushanasvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dead Hassan, and another participant, Temuri Mirsoev, attended by a nephew, Dedo Hasan.
Nevertheless, Mr. Galeottie noted that some individuals were not related to Usayan.
In his view, all of them were more common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, a scandal about the inclusion of Gregory Leps, a favorite singer of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, drew the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we hope that we will receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, for which it has been decided why it has been added to such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State of Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
The interests of all citizens of the RF will be protected, as well as the interests of all citizens of the RF.
Head of Gasproma Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere.
The start of the South Flow pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazproma.
“A marking event has taken place today: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Flow, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said Chairman Gazproma Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The Southern Flow is designed to diversify Russian export routes through Europe.
Officials say that the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which hosts most of the European gas in Russia, increases the risk of normal routes.
Miller stated that direct communication with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Flow at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gasprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff members were accused of sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission became aware
Two staff members of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children prior to charges in 2011 against a childcare institution in Karingbakh Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission ' s opening statement stated that it had “no time to deal with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Haira, asked about one case where an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case where an instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hair told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He recognized that YMCA had also admitted inaccurate in the Commission ' s opening speech, stating that “external reviews of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was in the first row of child security”.
The evidence provided by the commissions indicated that YMCA had been notified that it had received the second out of the four possible quality audit evaluations carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayre, who had entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed by hiring Lord and was also unable to ensure a clear understanding by staff of their obligations regarding reports of child security violations.
Previously this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two-year work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA had prevented staff from reporting the violations of the Lord in the field of child safety.
The staff members testified that they had observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with children, was caring for them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked her to teach the child ' s protection because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that she had found Jackie Barnath, the guardian of YMCA ' s children ' s office in Karingbahe, who was head of Lord ' s “almost frightening and often inaccessible”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept the explanations made by staff members that they were uncomfortable to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord had led them to think of the need to report him.
Mr. Hayr said that he had presented to the JMCA Board of New South Wales his view that the lesson for the organization of “the events with Jonathan Lord” was not “announced to provide information” by staff members, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements was decided shortly after the charges were made by the Director General of YMCA for the custody of the children of Liam Whitley.
He said that it was intended to prevent the deterioration of evidence, but that was “extracted”, and that decision had not been realized.
YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during the work of Jonathan Lord during the period 2009 - 2011, reported to the Commission an expert on child degradation, Professor Stephen Smolboun of the Griffith University.
He said that there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, training, training and controlling staff.
Hearings deferred until 20 December.

Tony Blair said that he would use the chance of returning as British Prime Minister but acknowledged that it was unlikely to return.
Last night, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his post, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years of leadership, Blair has greatly avoided discussions of British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question of whether he would return to Prime Minister, Blair, according to the report of London Evening Standard, said: “Yes, of course, but this is not likely to happen, so...”
Masimiliano Allegri, chief coach of Milana, regretted the results of the 10th round of the Italian Championship with "Lacy".
The expert also noted that the failures in the startup are due to a series of trauma on the lead players.
I'm so sorry that we couldn't win, and that's the Tmw words Allegrey.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't let "Lacy" do anything.
In the second Romans, I have added, but in general, I can't say we've lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we did the task of hitting the League of Champions.
We are now stuck behind the schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries from key footballers.
Rami and Honda?
They're very good players with character.
But our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Connosporting experts travelling to Cardiff to fight for the Least Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirklande.
Not even a schoolchild, just a few months earlier, who had taken his first steps, this kid and his Shetland ponies, Toffy, had been racing through three tourists to take the lead easily, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, the same growth, received high scores for the appearance, behaviour and style at the annual contest, which is held by the Sannibank Conna Sport Centre in the city of Radri near Kardiff.
Having come to the fore in the background of men and women in elegant cotton hats, he humiliated his cap and haughtyly spent a round of two years in Toffy.
The judges commended Fenton for having not been able to treat horses in an unprecedented manner for years.
Toffy received the highest estimate for the appearance and nature.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday last March, and since then he has been engaged in the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy make a great duet."
They had many rivals, but the two left with a golden cup and a rose.
It was just his second speech with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
The strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, that near Abb-Wayl in South Wales, is following the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Hawels, who is exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The public was struck and everyone shouted and smashed.”
He ran through the sand all along the length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy from animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chicks he cares for.
As he begins, he will soon be able to participate in the “Loshadi Year” — and I am confident that he will speak well.
The representative of this annual exhibition said, “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to treat his pony”.
Together they're a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for their presentation on the ring.
They appreciate the coherence of the pony and the factory — Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive dress, he really looked good in his role.
Published Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a call for the release of the accused in slander, should be reorganized, reports the press controller.
The New Express of Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yungjou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently confessed on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now, the New Expression should be followed by a “full corrective process”, as the regulator reports.
The order of “correct correction” came from the Guandouan Press and Publications, Radio, Cinema and Television Office.
Preliminary investigations showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group had published several false reports of a registered zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The edition of the New Express was dissorted, ” says the regulator’s statement.
He reports that it has been decided “to impose an administrative levy on Cheng Yunghou in the form of a revocation of his reporter's licence”.
It also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct the errors of the New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation of the newspaper and immediately amend the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, which claimed financial violations in the construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the first band, stating that it supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, recognizing that he had published false articles for money.
“In that case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the whole news media industry and its ability to be trustworthy to the public,” he said to the public broadcasting company CTV.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my fault.
Following Mr. Chen's confessions, New Express issued apology on the first strip, stating that the newspaper had failed to verify his reports properly.
Several high-ranking suspects have recently confessed on television.
Experts say that the practice of extortion of confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit the authorities from compelling anyone to conspiracy.
U.S. Tunnel — Mexico for the trans-shipment of drugs equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel with four by three feet wide as one of the most complex secret moves they have ever found.
This tunnel, which has the length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
This area is filled with unrecognised warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unrecognised through it, as the authorities stated.
According to judicial documents, the law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and £327 in the detection of the tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with keeping marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
They are sentenced to imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which set up a difficult task for drug cartels to quickly deliver their food to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards equipped with railways from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses of San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions are increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November of this year, and correspondents to BELT have been informed by BELT to the Chief Pension Administration of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
Since 1 November this year, adjustments to the average wages of employees in the Republic applied to the previous recalculation of pensions will be made, with a 5.4 per cent increase in the amount of pensions and the corresponding recalculation of pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recalculation, work pensions for the age of November are estimated to increase by an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions relates to 2.4 million residents of the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Welfare Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions from November this year will increase to Br274.3 billion per month.
At the same time, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated in November of this year in connection with an increase in the income minimum average per capita budget.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 47,530, by 2.1 per cent higher than that of 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, 2.1 per cent of the minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and pensions will be increased from 1 November onwards.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion to 0.
British police have given Assanja notice of extradition
The British police have now given notice to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanja, who hid himself in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they stated that they had given the 40-year-old Australian “official demand to surrender” to the police station, adding that in the event of non-compliance, he would be further arrested.
Assangou threatens to be extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, he hid himself on 19 June in the Equatorial Embassy in London, seeking political asylum from this South American country.
Scottland Yard “entered the 40-year-old man's official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice”, as the press secretary informed him.
It continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the police notification.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible spying charges after the publication of over 250,000 U.S. Diplomatic Deпешes against the secretity of the WikiLeaks website.
Driving driver at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot beverage between his legs, fined by £1000
The vehicle was fined at 1,000 £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h), with a hot beverage between legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howi of Typtri, Essex, was observed driving his Mercedes Benz on A120 in Braintri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry him between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester Howi, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
An addendum to his driving certificate of seven penal points resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Howi also committed itself to paying 90 pounds and additional $100 to assist victims of crime.
The tax for foreign real estate owners will lead to the bladeing of the London bubble
Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital taxation measure but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who, in the 2012 budget, introduced a 7 per cent public duty rate for houses worth more than 2 million dollars and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in association rather than as individuals.
For the time being, the land for residence in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already higher than the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-eastern, north-west, Yorkshire and Hambert together.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the expansion of the State's duty station into expensive homes and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is underestimated regardless of the influence of an aged municipal tax system.”
“But this may lead to the reluctance of some foreign investors to buy real estate in London or the current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
Principal real estate — the upper 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market — has risen by record 11.8 per cent over the past year in the rich southwestern London belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon.
According to the Savills study, prices in the middle of London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6 per cent in annual calculations, but they were hampered by an active “development market” with splashing prices in south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tail moves are related to its mood.
Early research has shown that happy dogs spin their tail on the right side (from the dog’s point of view), while disturbed dogs wag their tail mainly on the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of a dog’s family can observe these thin differences in the tail and respond to it.
Professor Georgeio Vallortigar, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the formation of motivators that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He added that just like a human, dogs with the right part of the brain control the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about the reactions of dogs to the tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heartbeat of animals and analysed their behavior.
We may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Professor Vallortigar said: "We showed dogs videos with dogs, either naturalistic versions, or silhouettes, to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and guide the tail more to the left or to the right."
When the animals saw that in the rest, the unexpressed dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the tailing dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that their tail was tilted mainly to the left, their heartbeat increased and they looked disturbed.
Professor Vallortigar said that he didn't think dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, what movements they should worry about, and what movements they should not worry about.
He observes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tail is related to friendlier conduct and the right side is less friendly, the dog responds on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
A dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, invited by a researcher at the Bristol University Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to verify whether the left and right sides were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads left if they look at an aggressive dog and right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Obstacles were more likely to approach a dog when the tailing was directed to the left instead of to the right, rather than to be alarmed, to the contrary to Italian research.”
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It would be useful to study how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“When there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Arctic Monkeys postpone a concert in Glasgo because of Alex Turner's disease.
Rock group Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after her vocalist had diagnosed Laringitis.
This Sheffild group was to be on the Hydro city concert site on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s disease forced them to carry the show.
This statement of the group was made after it had been forced to postpone a concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official Arctic Monkeys website, it was stated: “After the decision to transfer the show to the LG Arena of Burmese tonight and after the treatment of the Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed on the Hydro site in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with Laringit, and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”
The LG Arena show at Birmingham will be held on 20 November and the Glasgo show will be held on 21 November.

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will bring new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as declared on Thursday by the Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are choosing the pope, so that Francisk will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in his successor's choice.
There are now 201 cardinal.
However, after he reached the age of 80, he was no longer able to participate in the papal elections, which was the prerogative of the 120 “cardynals voters”.
In announcement of this news, the Vatican Spokesman, Father Federico Lombardy, said that a meeting of all current cardinals known as a conspiracy would be held prior to the ceremonies of the San.
“Papa Francisk decided to report in advance on his decision to convene a conspiracy in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardy.
Jack Valero, of Catholic Voices, said that by February, the number of electoral cardinals would probably decline.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary to bring the number of elected cardinals back to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he would like.
The next year's conspiracy will be of great importance because it will be the first one since Francesk's election in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially for Italy.
“It would be interesting to see whether a new pope would appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but are represented by a few cardinals.
These will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who are mandated to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that “only possible” Francis would turn to cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in such a situation before — all for us for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually taking the cardinal of Bishops from large parishes, but Francisk was “a full of surprises — so we don't know who he would call.”
GM cancels a number of new peaks in the United States to refine seat backs
General Motors Co rejects almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models in 2014 to address problems with manual seat back-waste adjustments, according to a Friday notification from U.S. regulators on vehicle safety.
On some of the peaks, the front seats may have a defect in the back inclination mechanism.
As a result of seat backing, seats are not consistent with federal transport safety standards on head restraints.
“The head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passenger at the rear of the vehicle by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
The models revoked were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM graduation of the GM peaks started in June and represents the most important launching of the car in the serial production for the lead American autoproducer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the peak defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to consider the notification to the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the sale of cars in October.
The sales of the Silverado and Sierra peaks, which were upgraded for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 peaks of Silverado and 16,503 peaks of Sierra.
GM shares in the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday to $37.47.
Obama’s Deployment Cry
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the republican obstruction to erode commendable efforts.
Instructionism cannot justify the problem with the Obama health system reformed and the unmanned attacks
The 2008 Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Second School of Health at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terrible sad book in these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me in times of disappointment at the Second School of Medicine and renew my hope.
It is called “The Persistence for Victory”, and it is the memoirs of the 2008 Presidential campaign of Barak Obama.
When I finish at night writing reports on my patients and going to bed, this book returns me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people, and statements might be spirit-taking.
The election victory has proved to be an impressive one, and the leading news programmes have paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
The White House had to come to a young strategy team, and the people were ready for change.
At Obama ' s entry into the post in 2008, the level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return to the present constitutes a rude awakening, like a snuff out of the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memorial, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
Over the years since I missed my first ballot paper, there have been real changes.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable health care to the withdrawal of our military personnel from Iraq, to the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, don't talk”, the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, defending it before colleagues and peers, I ended up having the explanations I could give.
I've reached the point of political despair.
The republican obstructionism cannot explain the authorization to hear foreign leaders or to strike unmanned children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of detectors who disclose the misconduct of the Government.
It cannot explain the killing of an American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or failure to comply with the limits of public finance and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
He could not justify the findings of the report, which stated that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media were “the most aggressive... since the Nicson administration”.
Recently, it has been unable to justify what is unable to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know if that's what I should expect.
Should I have been 18 years old to realize that leadership can be contrary to the political campaigns that precede him?
Obviously, the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by the opposition political party and such random events as the Newtown beating.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have cited above show that they were largely the choices of the administration.
And that's what's bothering me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rough alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to decide on his own policies or views.
I believed that, within my second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would justify the hopes we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, returning to 2008 through this book became much more difficult.
This makes me trembling on many of the promises that have flyed away.
This week I read that part of the book that describes how Klinton caused a deaf loss to Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
He told his staff at a meeting on the reasons for failure that they should return to normality and remain faithful to their goal.
“ I want us to return our attractiveness, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that Deputy Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest with regard to child leave.
Deputy Millionaire Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest in child leave because his daughters can become pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining magnet, with an unresolved carbon tax dispute in the amount of $6 million, made this statement at the time he tried to evade the question of whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be critical in deciding to abolish carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be held by ministers, and said that Mr. Abbot's daughter would personally win from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the Electoral Commission formally declared Mr. Palmer as the victor for the Sanshein-Cost seat of the Firfax electoral district, with 53 votes after the recalculation of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a reconsideration of the electoral counting procedure to expedite the process.
Tony Abbota Francis and Bridgite's daughters.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need a better system, ” he said.
Why don't we have a system to come, put our data into the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 18:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for ballot markings.
Is that because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Use a pencil in our time seems weird.
The Electoral Commission examines opportunities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, aged 59, said that his programme included the international airport for Sãošin Kost and would “very seriously” take his new work.
The State post involves the service of the society.
“We do not seek any reward except for the gratitude of history for the fact that we can serve this county at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS removes two exchange trailers
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily dismissed two traders in its currency unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global checks by the controllers of the alleged exchange-market manipulations are accelerating rapidly.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigations of the world’s largest financial market, with a daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff who have been dismissed during an initiating investigation, which is overlapped with a scandal related to the LIBOR inter-bank rate manipulations.
Refusing to comment on removals, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and other our regulators,” reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had sent e-mail and instant messaging records that he received and sent to his former trader, the Governing Body of Great Britain, the Financial Performance Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave at his current position as head of European spontaneous exchange commerce in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the leader of the European spontaneous trade in Citi, left on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior exchange trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by the Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
The instant communication group, Mr. Asher, included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that he had taken action against some of his staff after the Swiss Finma governor had said that he was investigating the alleged manipulations in the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Antimonopoly Authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a conspiracy to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, said acquaintances.
Banks have examined instantaneous communications and e-mails over a few years in search of offences.
The news of the audits has spurred traders in the area of activities, which has been one of the largest sources of revenues for the investment banks in recent years, which this year, however, has encountered difficulties because the low volatility of currencies reduces the opportunities for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the vast and high-level currency market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the high volume of daily exchange-market trades, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trade platforms and the wider use of banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market for a very small price”.
This news came on the same day when the Credit Suisse Bank announced that one of the traders in the London Exchange department had been fired this week, after it had caused the loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and collaborates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that the issue has been localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has now ruled that Barak Obama's Significant Law on Health is constitutional, which is a major victory to the Obama Administration.
By votes 5 to 4, the judges ruled that individual orders under the Patient Protection and Accessible Health Act, requiring citizens to acquire medical insurance prior to 2014 or pay a fine, were constitutional in accordance with the authority of the Government on taxation.
John Roberts, President of the Supreme Court, joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also left the remaining sections of the 2,700 country law in force and further decided that the requirement of the Health Act to improve the compliance of States with the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally forced.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed an application for blocking the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican candidates to the Presidents during the 2012 primary election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the difference?
In the Lord's Office, policymakers and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals were the banning of football in the North Caucasus, because of the fact that the game was a scandal and a discord.
Speaker Sergei Narichkin recalled recent developments in Birulev and said that in order to reduce “the degree of social tension”, policies and media should be correct in their comments.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surrounded the Caucasus with a barbed wire if they do not want to limit fertility...
All speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and of measures to harmonize relations among the peoples of Russia, which gave discussion a comprehension.
Maxim Grigorèv stated that the events in Birulev are a “model conflict that could be predicted”, but “we have too many people and institutions” and seven nuns without eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism that has long been practised by Europe against migrants, according to the public, has failed and must be sought.
Historian Yuri Petrov had placed great hopes for a new unified book of history.
“There must be a handbook on the history of the people's culture, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that they live in Dagestan and vice versa,” he said.
Hennady Zuganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility for "the Russian dismemberment call," "if in the U.S. to say on the radio that Alaska is to be given to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski was trying hard not to incinerate.
As usual, he accused journalists who face the sick and acute national problems to the public debate, "In the dust of the debate, there's little to say!"
The leader of the Uniform Russia, Vladimir Vasilev, immediately advised journalists to conclude a “hardship” and agree to speak on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can take on policy.
We have adopted some 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole established, Mr. Vasilev has stated.
As an example, he cited the law that imposes responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for the international peace in their territory.
However, Ludmil Andricenko was not appreciative about the law: there is no " clear indication of what migrants are adapting, how they are adapted and how they fit.
Substantives would then interpret the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the staff required to address such complex issues, there is no means, and the methodological recommendations they can use are not available to them....
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the establishment of a special department with a formidable title, “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tishkov, who headed a similar department in the 1990s, later abolished, opposed it.
It is sufficient to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio” to be approached if so.
“We are going across the edge, the shells are breaking around, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnos and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should be given decent information support”, said the representative of the CPC on relations with society, the Universal Stramplin.
No neutrality of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religion, should, in his view, be.
Here, Oleg Neil led the discussion into an unexpected direction, saying, "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, they are yet to be searched, but they are pushed by a wrong path," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of soccer, "That's the football player that beats all the crowds, the flags blaze, and the comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need soccer like that.
There's another type of sport -- the raggie is called...
"They won't be in the world in this kind of sport!"
No one will play in the Caucasus in the Regbi!
You're still going to give them a ride!
We need to know the national characteristics, it's like the Georgian "Placing" offers...
In Jaroslavle, the wild behavior in the rostrum was characterized by the Moscow Club, during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS Control and Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuban was fined by 500,000 roubles, transmitting correspondent Philip PAPENKOV from the House of Soccer.
Such sanctions against the Redodar Club are applied for the fire of the Dagestan flag by the nephews on the rostrum during the 14th round of the 14th Turor v. Ange.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from RFPL.
We have explored all available materials.
For the misconduct of the Cuban spectators, 500,000 roubles are fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei filed an action on Nortel's patent
The group owning thousands of former Nortel patents gave a series of patent claims on Thursday against mobile phone producers, including the Google company, which she overwhelmed in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar Consortium, which bought for $4.5 billion of Nortel's patent, filed claims for the violation of patent rights before the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google's accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help compare key searches on the Internet with advertising, as stated in a claim, which is the basis for Google search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on Android's operating system from Google, which strongly competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial $900 million price for Nortel's patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, ultimately proposing $4.4 billion.
He won the Nortel Patents Consortium Rockstar, Google got Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this transaction the determinant was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Notwithstanding the failure of attempts to auction patents that are the subject of the claim, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court action states.
Rockstar demands an increased compensation for Google losses because he claims that Google's violation of patent rights is deliberate, according to a claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected President is sworn
Mohammed Murse is sworn, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Murse promised “new Egypt” when he swore, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, which was overthrown 16 months ago.
At its inauguration to the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murcia also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt, after the renouncement of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He swore before 18 judges in black mantles in a court building on the shore of Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are seeking a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Murcia during the solemn ceremony in direct air on public television.
“Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Bratew-Muslim, a fundamentalist group, which was mostly out of 84 years of existence, a banned organization that has served as a target for the rigid actions of successive Governments.
The building guarded hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Murcy arrived with a small cartage shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new President, and, unlike the Presidential pampas of Mubarak's times, the movement was stopped for only a short time to miss its convoy on a usually live road connecting the city centre with the suburbs of the south.
Although Murcy was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “dangerous wheel” of Bratjav, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamicists, but also for all those who want to end the 2011 rebellion against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Murcy, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, in a blanked wooden panel, where he took the oath.
Later, Murcy went to Cairo University, where he had to speak his inaugural speech.
He was granted an official reception with an Armenian orchestra who carried out a state hymn during which he stood on the “smart” stand.
The Feldmarshal Hussein Tantavay military officer was present.
His visit was met by the slogan “Army and People — One Hand, ” which scanded hundreds of the university’s main lecture hall.
Based in 1908 as an entrance of secular education, the University of Cairo in the 1970s became the embodiment of the Islamist Student Groups.
Mursie took the symbolic oath on Friday in the Tahrir Square, where the revolt ended by Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to re-establish the President whose office had been deprived of his office by the military council that had taken the case from the overthrown leader.
But by accepting a formal oath before the court, not before the Parliament, as accepted, he exercises the will of the military, and it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursie’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theateral pollistic gestures.
A further meeting of the Tumen Region Engineering Association was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Road Manufacturer.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of steel tubes was presented.
According to the business director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the marketing of steel designs in Tumenska was carried out in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of cargo pipes per month.
It was then decided to change the factory profile and install equipment for its production.
More than 7,000 tons of production has been shipped this year.
Investing in the factory amounted to over 120 million roubles, Denis Gribanov told.
A new state has been launched in October, allowing an assortment to increase.
The factory produces both a small profile of a tube that is used for the top-to-face, small construction and furniture and large for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, which will be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen area.
Despite the shift to another type of activity, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now 157, and the plan for the purchase of new equipment - an increase of more than 50 staff.
The enterprise is being retrained and the necessary professionals are selected from existing ones.
A new longitudinal rubber aggregate is expected to be up to five millimetres thick in the next year, thereby reducing the value of the products as well as another condition at the speed of the pipe production to 47 m per minute.
By the end of 2014, enterprises are about to learn the production of pipes that are used in the housing and communal sector.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumen needs for the product.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroum, appealing to the Manufacturing Managers, recommended that more attention be given to the modernization of machines.
The forms of public support for the industry include the reimbursement of interest rates for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
The current year provides for 150 million roubles for this purpose, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidies contracts, shall adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the future year, the budget provides for the amount of 150 million roubles that can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to fairs, and 3 million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment in the southern Tumen area for the oil gas compound has been reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumo, this form of support will in the long run cease, as it was motivated by compensation for the mining tax that oil companies had paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not make this and subsidies become direct cost-effective commitments from the region.
The Government therefore prioritizes the direct support of industrial enterprises rather than the financing of the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation with regard to petroleum.
The contribution to their equipment is a competitive advantage of the southern Tumen industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian median strip, where the cheaper labour force is more.
In addition, the question is unclear with the successibility of the new owner of TNC-XB, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders in the Tumen businesses.
The implementing agreement of the Outawa Project expires in 2013 and no extension requests have been received.
Currently, south enterprises specializing in oil-gas equipment cannot form a portfolio for the future year.
It remains open to the question whether taxes from oil extraction in the Uwatt region will be received to the budget of the region or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomic will spend 240 hours on extremist social roles
The Tomsk District Court of Lenin sentenced 240 hours of mandatory work of the city resident, who had placed videos on the social network of extremist targeting, reported to RIA Newsty on Friday, a representative of the provincial press court.
According to the court, in March 2013 a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was included in a federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case has been instituted against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Criminal Code, entitled “Advances aimed at incitement to hatred and hostility, as well as at humiliating the dignity of the person committed publicly”.
“The Leeni District Court has dealt with the case in a special manner and has found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence to be punished by 240 hours of mandatory work”, said the agency interview.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians that the price of goods had been eroded since the signing of the association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nicolas Azarov, is convinced that the prices in the country will fall considerably after the country signs an agreement on association with the European Union.
He said that in communication with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, customs duties for the import of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
That would mean that prices should go down.
“This is about the goods that come from EU countries,” wrote Azarov.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be that direct and indirect.
However, there should not be price increases either.
Therefore, reports on bildards, which have recently become quite numerous in our country, that association with the EU is a rise in prices, it is not exactly, or if it is not, in a more precise way,” summarized Azarov.
Investigators check information on child abuse in Bishk
On 29 October, the media reported that the tutor of one of the Bishk children ' s gardens had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
All circumstances are currently being clarified by investigators and legally assessed by the staff of the nursery.
After the accusation of the foolishness of Eugenia Vasilev,
Eugenia Vasilev, whose personal attention has been focused on the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on the abductions in Minoбороna and on her personal relationships with the Minister of Defence, Anatolia Serdukov, her poetry and the addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the Defense Service figure violated silence.
In an interview of Life News Vasilev, she said, "Of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail that I had to testify, otherwise I would be imprisoned.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court to prove our innocence.
We have 100% confidence in winning.
In doing so, we can conclude from the interview that Vasilevu may have been most likely to have said that her taste is not important.
Probably referred to the statement by the official representative of the SC, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected by the Defense Service case had found counterfeiting.
Among the arrested property, there are a number of paintings that the master, confident of her deep knowledge of the arts, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, an artisanal expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, in fact, were cheap forgeries”, noted Markin in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from the Minoborna, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal points?
I think it's just unprecedented," says Vasilev.
At the same time, on the question of whether she acknowledged her guilt in any of the 12 criminal episodes that she had committed, Vasilevu stated: “No, of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation as it is.
Just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the SCR that Vasilev was evading the investigation of criminal proceedings, the lawyer of the figure stated that he and his client “did not get to know the material of the case”.
What led to the revelations of Vasilev, who still had no contact with the press, under her house arrest?
How could a woman not answer the accusation of a bad taste?
Or are the journalists of the Comsomodolka who claimed a couple of days ago that she was "injected with more house arrests" because of the report of Anatolia Serdukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
Victor Baranz in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?" wrote, "The mediators do not preclude that after such a shock, she may become more talkative on interrogation."
Before Vasilev, some charges of illegal sales of real property of Minoбороna took place.

This tourist firm now expects its main full annual pre-tax profits to be between $325 and $340 million, compared with the previous projection from $305 to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are achieved, this will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had earned 8 per cent of the first half of the year and had started the second half with good indicators, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the British.
“ Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record high profit in a full year before the deduction of interest and tax contributions, ” he said.
“This includes Australia and Great Britain, which usually bring us the largest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered during the second half of the year, compensating a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in Britain, the Flight Centre's leisure business went well, while corporate clients were spending less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half of the year and the return is expected for the third full year in a row.
The Flight Centre rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police detected two gaming halls.
The first worked in an Industrial area on the Winter Street.
At the time of the commencement check, there was a game.
There were 24 machines at the club.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on the street of Anton Petrov.
20 game machines were used here.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation for Barnaul reports that administrative materials have been produced under the article “Illicit gambling and gambling”.
Technique was taken off.
The facts will soon be reported to the courts of the Industrial and Lenin districts of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police conduct a search for a criminal who was brutally murdered with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the New Region press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, the previous day in the Kyrov district of the city of Kyrov, after a fire in a three-room apartment located in the Housing House on the street of Ural, two women were identified with signs of violent death.
Shortly thereafter, the identity of the dead was established.
It turns out it's sisters, one of them's Ekaterinburg resident for 44 years, and the other is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The worst apartment they rented a few days ago.
His investigation was monitored by Mikhail Borodone, Chief Police Region.
The internal affairs authorities have developed various versions of killings, and have checked the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons inclined to do so.
In addition, the purpose of the women ' s rental of the apartment is to be determined, and where they have lived before they have been involved with whom they have maintained their relationship.
Schools called for increased attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require the students to study at least one of Shakespeare’s plays, 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British artistic literature since 1914.
The examination will also provide “extraprogramme texts” to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will have to pass a separate graduation examination in the language, with persistent recommendations for the choice of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should issue new English and mathematical curricula tomorrow, the first subjects under radical review.
It will amend other major items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of examinations, OFQUAL, will present a revised structure of secondary school graduation, with a new system of evaluations and a lower level of course.
In the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that “the broad consensus was reached that we should reform our system of examinations in order to restore public confidence”, insisting that the school graduation examinations would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week, over a quarter, than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore employs about 138 hours.
Although no formal requirement for more time in mathematics would be required, coalition sources said that large school mathematics graduation, combined with a higher rating factor, would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional education on the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on real-life challenges, including financial mathematics.
Hayhe tickets will cost 2,200 roubles tourists
Since tomorrow, tourists will begin to carry ships on air cushion from the Good Newsk in Hayhea.
For those wishing to go to China, that means additional waste.
The puma ticket has traditionally been much more expensive than the warmth.
As reported in the AmurrASSO reference service, the cost of the usual ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
It's going to cost 2,800 roubles.
By the word, the tickets were not traveling during this season: at the same price, the puma was carried by tourists and by the spring past, and autumn a year ago.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth in RF is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that its GDP growth is insufficient for the FM and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy by innovating, reports Reuters.
We planned this year to increase GDP in the area of 3%, maybe even a little more.
It'll really be a little less than 2%.
In the background of recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but it is not for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
Now, it's very important that Russian companies, Russian business, get normal loans at normal prices, is the first thing they need to do," emphasized the head of government.

Travel on mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients.
There are few doctors in this West African country — only one per 5,000
vote here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 major heroes to become the Hero of the year CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
During 21 years, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and relapse into an unconscious state, throwing in hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken hand, but the infectious infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that resembled himself for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neuroscientists in Cameroon, ” said George Bwell.
If we had money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle had accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals for years to receive any treatment they could receive.
“ It’s not easy, ” said Bwell.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first one.
Patients are a lot.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed dramatically since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 in Cameroon.
In comparison, the United States has a medical ratio of 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians were able to contact the doctor, many of them would have been unable to do so.
Two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the health costs are private.
“ They are the only problem of poverty, ” said Bwell.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their life.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and a lot of his fellow countrymen, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year Dr. George Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a receptacle surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It has also established a non-profit ASCOVIME organization, which organizes weekend visits to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are imprisoned in vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies, and traveled from a crossroads to visit needy villages.
They don't always get lucky.
They had to push cars through rivers and muds.
But when they come, they are met as real heroes: it's a holiday with songs and dances, and the best rooms that the locals can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for the holiday, and Bwella, with its broad smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” said Bwell.
They come from a circuit in a radius of 60 kilometres from the village, and they walk.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bones, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents necessary for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the Brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are typically carried out in the school, municipality or home building; patients rise up and go to the post-operation zone to release the place for the next person.
Using the generator to illuminate the operating and hygienic treatment of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
This is a slow pace, but the brigade’s determination is usually helping to support village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and keep working, ” said Bwell.
On Sunday, brigade members return to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free operations in the past year, and they know that their assistance may be of great importance to those to whom they assist.
One person explained that his free treatment operation would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions on weekends and work at the hospital, Bwella is also working at nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second work, he said, that provided 60 per cent of its non-profit organization's funding; the rest were covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Mally, a medical student at the Second Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell.
He's always either in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization to continue the campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwell in his tasks, it is an opportunity for them to have practice that they never would have received at home.
“We have been able to assist in operations where we helped to remove blood spots or hold instruments for Dr. Bwell,” said O'Malley.
As a secondary student, you would never have been able to do so in America.
Volorent students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often with donated medications.
But on arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training pays Bullah.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gave his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon was endless.
For Bwella, almost constant loading is not a heavy test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise is something that brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this job, ” said Bwell.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it so people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME site and see what you can do to help.
Cnoudden agreed to testify to Mercel
The Bundestag deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowen.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness by the FWG Genocurat in the case of the possible hearing of the German Chancellor by the U.S. Special Slavs.
Cnoudden was prepared to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, says Hans-Cristian Strebel, that he knows very much.
Although the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all its movements, Snowen was ready to come to Germany.
But first, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, American legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal around the U.S. spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Macay, stated to the journalists at a press conference, following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Dawutoglu, reported by BELTA correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkey relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the authorities of the two countries will provide wide-ranging assistance and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” said Vladimir Macay.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for that purpose and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that an 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, following which the protocol was signed.
Parties have developed a road map of Belarusian Turkish interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Policy Department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the areas of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as in the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
“The past meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey are considering each other as reliable partners,” he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Dawutoglu, reported that the two heads of foreign policy agencies had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects during the negotiations.
The Minister believes that trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased and brought to a value of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
Our countries have always had a very warm relationship, and we hope that they will be further strengthened and expanded in the future.
As well as all necessary conditions for trade and economic ties and for the success of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey”, Ahmet Davutoglu noted.
Obama refuses to speak of health care
In the midst of the criticism, President Obama went to a clutter yesterday with regard to his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can preserve it”.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of discontinuing service delivery from their providers, the Republicans have in recent days criticized the President for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama subjugated some of his original public promise.
“The majority of people with medical insurance that works can preserve it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he called “a life in the news” with regard to the end of service delivery, Obama called on American recipients to seek other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than projected.
“You'll get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people buying insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the law on affordable health care.
“Let me tell these Americans: you deserve better,” said Sibelius in her address to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who governed the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site had been “grimly bad” since October.
“ I’m upset and upset just like everyone else, ” she said.
“I really want to return your trust.”
The irritated Sibelius dismissed this phrase, which was captured by the included microphone behind it by an assistant in the Chamber hearings in the morning following a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives of Billi Long, a republican from Missouri State, whether she was obliged to enter the Obama health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “Aghitector” of the law on affordable health care voluntarily did not renounce government-sponsored insurance for the purchase of a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency deprived the media's status for non-communicable warfare.
On 31 October, Moshorud decided to recognize the invalid registration licence of the Rosbalt Agency, writes “Lanta”.
The deprivation of the media status agency insisted on the systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was created during the process: the court considered it possible to close the media, de facto refusing the publication in the right to propose counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"?
ZAO, Rosbalt Information Agency, was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agencies also have representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the middle of the 2000s, the agency was listed in the list of the most familiar private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a fairly specific niche: the nucleus of the Agency ' s exclusive publications were (and still) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of publication to force structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
In addition to the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive source base in various departments, it was also suggested that Natalia Chaplina, the wife of Victor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, the role of Chaplina in the Rosbalt Guide is not clear to the end: it is often called “project leader”.
The Director-General of the Agency is Larisa Afonin, chief editor, Nicolas Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been represented in federal media ratings, either by quotation or by audience.
In October, the Agency took a 25th place in the rating of Russian media websites under the LiveInternet version.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), a monthly average of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months are the notes of the Kremlin's powerlessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of a crow and joke group salist, the raids in the capital Birulev.
The Rosbalta conflict with Roskomondor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law had entered into force, prohibiting non-censorial warfare for journalists.
The statement found a banned lexicon in two videos published on the website (“Jigit from Redaudor” and “Pussy Riot desecrated oil excavations”.
The further sides are described in different ways.
Roskomoveror, on the basis of the detected videos, accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the media law and demanded that a licence be taken from the agency.
The Rosbalta stated that the agency ' s claims were wrong: first, the videos were not drafting materials, secondly, the mother ' s words were masked, and third, immediately after warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The representatives of the agency appealed against the claims of Roskochenador to the World Court, and when Mosgorud adopted the Roskomover case on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 members of the world's judge have decided not to favour “Rosbalta”: Nikolai Ulyanov, chief editor, was found guilty of a violation of the Code on Administrative Offences and was fined by 20,000 roubles, 10,000 per video.
Obviously, that was the outcome of the hearing in Moscow, if you abandon the thought that the outcome could have been anticipated before.
On 31 October, the court decided to recognize the invalid registration certificate of Rosbalta by depriving the media status agency.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the Deputies of the State (the statement addressed to the Head of Roscomnador, Alexander Jarov, on 10 October, was signed by 26 deputies; the paper was submitted at the initiative of CRC).
The Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Paul Gusev, and the President of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, said that the closure was wrong.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomover even provided him with some guarantees that the case would not be reached before the licence was withdrawn.
The Rosbalt Court has shown that under whose jurisdiction the media is safer in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed chemicals equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacities, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus, has completed the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy the production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisoning substances to be used shall transfer BBCs.
Destruction of the stockpiles of poisoning substances themselves or their chemicals must be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, poisoning substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were reportedly killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemicals - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and munitions.
These productive capacities will now be closely monitored so as not to allow them to be replenished.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stockpiles of poisoning substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly examined by Western intelligence agencies.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors of new facilities to check if they suspected that Damascus was not entirely frank.
The United States believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached in the Russian mediation, to destroy or bring into a non-working state all the capacity for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for filling the shells with these substances.
Now that this phase is over, the next step must be the destruction of the already existing chemicals of the Syrian army.
It is expected that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve and paralytic poisoning, hot and spark gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
It requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities begin to agree on a timetable for action, which takes two weeks to do so.
The OPCW leader Jerry Smith stated Bibi-shi that his inspectors “watched the destruction of equipment”.
“They are no longer able to do any further production or mixing of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 out of 23 facilities in Syria and found that the shelling and poisoning plants were either destroyed or destroyed.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out the inspection there, referred to in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical-producing infrastructure was “especially difficult”, as it had to work in an ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, it was not time for the inspectors to celebrate it until they were too busy.
John Carrie says in his unprecedented confession that the U.S. spy “was far off”
John Carrie demonstrated the mitigation of U.S. surveillance tactics by making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases the U.S. spying “has gone unprecedentedly far”.
The Secretary-General also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “in a car pilot” at the time of Edward Snowen's gross detection of the ANC spy activities.
These information leaks have been put by the U.S. Government in a diplomatic scandal centre with its allies.
Speaking on video links at an open government conference in London, Mr. Carrie said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and other members of the Government have actually accepted some of the things that are taking place on a motor pilot because this opportunity has already existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war and, of course, on 11 September.”
He then became the first high-level member of the United States Government to recognize that the United States spy had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases this has gone unsuitable far.
And the President is determined to shed light on the matter and explain itself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of innocent people in this process."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted well and that his operations of surveillance had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
There is radical extremism in the world, unreasonable and determined to kill people, explode people and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept this, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, building explosions and killings because we have been able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislators would go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged U.S. spy overseas and persuade the Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut Chris Murphy said that he had interviewed members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to end participation in anti-terrorist organizations due to the disappointment of the National Security Agency ' s monitoring.
“For US national security interests, it is indeed important that the Europeans remain our supporters for our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who has served as the first term and chaired the subcommittee for international relations of the European Senate, in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has deteriorated with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency stated this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other discrepancies included the public documents issued by Snoud, indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor’s mobile phone, Angels Mercel, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, defended spy activities against allies as necessary and said that this was a customary case on both sides.
In the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to the members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would be composed of members of both parties and of the two Chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be pronounced in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
While Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “violence for best reasons” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they themselves used for many years.
“When we can change our tracking programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence activities,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerri should go to these weekends to the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States intelligence activities.
In the new composition of public observation commissions, the influence of prison guards will increase
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public observation commissions (NCU) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voted option is adopted, the lobbies of the force will increase their influence.
KNCs are public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The works of Sergei Magnets and Leonida Razjava, the excitement in the colony of the Copiece - it is through the CONU that the majority of the resonance incidents are reported behind the grid.
The FNC is in the fight between human rights defenders and the lobbies of the militia.
At the meeting of the JI working group on the establishment of KFOR, I suggested that the selection criteria should be made of human rights experience.
"They didn't accept him and they made lists without the criteria," says Valerie Borschev.
The barrance is the current chairman of the Moscow Observatory and the Association of Independent Observers, a comprehensive structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
In the home of the Deputy of the Lord of the Jap, he has drafted a law governing the activities of the NCC.
The OP Council should vote in favour of the Constituencies of ONC in 43 regions of the country.
For 1,800 vacant places, fewer than a thousand wishing, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino Balkaria, competitions were unable to organize owing to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a vacancies donated to vacancies.
NCK Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borchev, in the current capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 forcemen, the ratio of 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted to go to the capital commission.
At the same time, a representative of the Bio Brotherhood Vyacheslov Kalinin may rejoin the new membership.
He had been a member of the FNC for three years, but he had never visited the prisoners.
The fighter believes that the Forcesmen, by appointing their chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude the collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the militia is coordinated by the member of ONC Anton Flowov, headed by the Russian Officials, an organization that advocates the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies for a truck," said Anton Flower every day, RBC.
He denied that he was lobbying any movement of lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opponents.
According to Florkov, he was not even interested in the list of OPs.
He considered Borche information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelbine NCC.
Her ex-government will be dismantled because of last year ' s turmoil.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And this is where NCK Rostova-na-Dona can move from human rights defenders to forcemen.
Of the new lists, the human rights defender-chair of the local commission, was one of his opponents, even though the Federal Public Chamber had expelled him for unethical conduct in May 2013.
Borchev's lists of Moscow and the Borchev Commissions consider it a “fountain for the Copask”.
The Defense of Tolokonica did not affect the Mordovia NNC, which was considered “powerful”, but wanted only one human rights defender to enter the new body, and she did not even have documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nicolas Swanidze, told the RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list because he was dismayed by the situation in Moscow and Rostove-na-Dona.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Paul Gusev said he voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the compilation of the lists of ONC by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told the RBC daily that it was not the right to share candidates for human rights defenders and militia and that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to obstruct the work of its members.
The Gribe does not foresee the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the next days.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days of prison on Phuket Island for false claims that she had been attacked by a taxist, appealed and released on bail.
Stephen Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on 15 June by the Phuket Provincial Court of false action following a report by the Thai police that the local taxist had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday on 10 June, while the other two men held her.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after she broke up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed that she had fabricated the story.
Before the trial, it was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment at the general prison centre in the area of Phuketa, not in the female adult prison.
She is the daughter of the former Australian League player, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to his daughter.
Tanks said in Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of her daughter and was looking forward to her return to Australia.
“It is obvious that it was an alarming time, but we hope that it will be safe to return home as soon as possible,” said Tanks.
Bamford appealed and was released on bail of 50,000 bahts.
According to the Australian reports, she has been taking her leave in the Krabie resort zone in southern Thailand at this time.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phuguet, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in her sentence of up to two years and forced her to serve in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian tourgent Michelle Smith in Phuguet, Thailand can also seek to rebuild its deteriorated tourist image, resulting in a justifiable sentence.
Now Roman Sengchien is in Paris to present his novel Eltischev, translated into French.
Remember, it was his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "Light Polna," "Russian Buker," "National Bestseller" and "Big Book."
Last year, the writer was awarded a cultural award from the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Sengchien is an undeniable leader in the generation of the current thirtieth and forty-year-old prosaics.
In fact, every publication of its rigid, modern - day narrative and narrative material is a source of hot debate among critics of many different ways.
It can be argued that the articles gathered together on the prose and publication of Sencini, his book reviews and journal publications create an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of the 2010s.
The debates on “one of the most controversial modern writers”, as critic Sergei Chuprinin said, are largely the subject of what its participants understand under the word “literature”, which sees the present and future not only of our words but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from regional media and blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and review articles are generally provided in the sections “Absacs...”
