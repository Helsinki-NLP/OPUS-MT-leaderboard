The rapid growing rate of cumulative coronary infection (COVID19) in the European Union and in Britain between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 has similar trends in European/European Economic Area and in Britain, thus affirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensified therapy, there is a need to improve the readiness for patients to swim with COVID-19, who will need treatment and in particular intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown ethology were reported in Hubei Province of China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infectious is a new type of coronavirus, now known as a coronavirus of severe 2-type acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80 per cent of people from COVID-19 have a light form of disease, i.e. in the form of respiratory paths with pneumonia or without it, with the majority of those who have become ill.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization and 6 per cent in the remaining 6 per cent take critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The rate of death of patients hospitalized with COVID19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyses the trends in COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/Economic Zone (EEZ) and in Britain and compares them with the trends in the Hubei Province of China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEE and in Britain with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID19 in EU/EEU and in Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamic as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID19 in Europe that met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them returned from Hubei Province of China.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 infections have been detected in all 30 EU/EEU countries and in Britain, with 39,727 infections and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, accounted for only Italy from 31 December 2019 to that date.
Determination of cumulative quantities and cumulative morbidity COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 the number of reported COVID19 cases in each country of the world from official sources, such as the ministries of health of these countries, national and regional health administrations and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the dissemination of COVID-19 in the EU/EEU and in Britain and to compare them with data on Italy.
As an indicator of the proliferation of active cases, COVID-19 has been calculated a complete COVID-19 cumulative morbidity for 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID19 in each EU/EEEU country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020 compared to the Italian data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in development COVID-19 in EU/EEU and in Britain
Trends in the development of the underlying cumulative morbidity COVID-19 in the 14-day period in the EU/EEEA and in Britain generally corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (figure 1).
COVID-19 in the EU/EEU and Britain as a whole began to grow around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020, a sharp leap of this indicator (additional material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also to all other EU/EEU countries and Britain, there have been similar trends in COVID-19 cumulative morbidity (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEE countries and in Britain compared with the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already recorded as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEU countries and in Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy for only about three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEE and in Britain.
The observed trends of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is notwithstanding the different stages in different countries, the differences in the responses taken by national public health authorities and perhaps different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different rules for the selection of patients to analyse the existence of COVID-19, including “converting” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 per cent of patients from COVID19 needed intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensified therapy offices in those regions had already been filled as much as possible.
Currently, data on the access of patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensified therapy in the EU/EEEA are available only for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (no).
However, such information needs to be systematically collected in order to supplement current monitoring data, which are the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, the number of cocaine in intensive therapy offices and intensified care offices in Europe is significant: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 cocaines per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive therapy offices and intensified care offices for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the COVID-19 risk estimation has provided scenarios for the downloading of health systems with estimates for the hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEEA country and in Britain, when the risk of a lack of accessible cocaine in the intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are now grouped into certain EU/EEU and British regions, and hospitals and intensified therapy offices usually serve the population of a territorial group, information on infections and the number of cocaines in intensive therapy offices is recommended to be provided at the 2nd level of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEEU and Britain is rapidly developing.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensified therapy offices should be prepared for a long-term SARS-CoV-2 contact scenario and for an increase in the number of patients in COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensified therapy, which can be observed in affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last ECDC report on risk-assessment results, it is important to deter the spread of SARS-COV-2 is an expeditious, proactive and integrated approach, followed by a shift from deterrence to minimization, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision makers and hospitals, it may simply not be sufficient time to reflect, take and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce their stress on their health systems.
If not, in the coming days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEE countries, there will be an influx of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID19), caused by the coronarius of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 2 type (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Like the homologic SARS-CoV virus, which called the development of a severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from volatile mice and cause similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lower than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article provides an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virusology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and prevention of the disease.
While many of the questions still remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (the Chinese New Year), which came out on 25 January in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese who were urged to remain at home throughout and many weeks after the holiday in connection with the outbreak of the new virus infection.
Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named the SARS-CoV-2 virus on 11 February 2020 and the associated disease by coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic began in the Chinese city of Uhang and spread rapidly throughout the country and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID19 were identified, more than 40,000 patients died, more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the enemy number one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/for less than two months, more than 200 publications on COVID19, including articles on its virus, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to compile the results of research in a new and fast-growing substantive area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare the COVID-19 with the SARS and the other crownvirus disease, the Crown Virus of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts of prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some of the other issues that are equally pressing.
The Crown Viruses were traditionally of pathogens, which are not deadly to human beings and mainly cause about 15 per cent of total respiratory diseases.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have faced two high-pathogenic human crowneria, that is, a coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and a coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which have triggered the outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and have soon spread to many other States with the appalling rate of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, the report of clusters of unknown origins was first received to the National Health Commission of the CIS of Whaan on 31 December 2019.
After seven days, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case in Huhan was registered.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was known that medical workers were infected, which allowed for the possibility of transmission of the virus from human beings.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced to Uhuan, and urban public transport ceased.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Uhang, which was considered a starting point of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronavirus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease has spread throughout China and has already penetrated some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the degree of risk of outbreak are yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-central clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with the confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qH2bhdA).
All age groups were infected by SARS-CoV-2, but mostly by people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7 per cent) were infected over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were still under 10 years of age.
Infiltration of SARS-CoV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly by clusters in Hubei Province and in nearby regions.
On average, from the time COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis, it took 5 (2-9) days.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
From the moment of symptoms to death, an average of 9.5 (4.8-13) days has been held.
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected, commensurate with large-scale transport transport on the eve of the celebration of Chinese New Year.
The death rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted death rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were: gender (human), age (60) and severe pneumonia.
Crown-viruses are a sub-semy of large siege viruses containing one thread of the BNC.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which the alpha and betacorn viruses are known to strike people.
In the case of damage to coronavirus such as SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of tumoral schiposoвидal sprouts (S) is linked to cellular receptors of angiotensin of a converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and a diephediedptidasa 4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the virus RNA gene; after replicating the virus genome, the genome RNA, together with ultraproteins and proteins of nucleocapsid, generates virion-containing vaziculs, which then combine with the membrane cell to release the virus.
The first reports on the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 10 January 2020.
It has been determined that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% of which coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease in the market for Huananne's products in Uhan.
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 particles have been detected in man's ultra-tonic reservoirs by means of a lighting electronic microscopy.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been determined to be a recipe for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-Protein SARS-CoV-2 is linked to a man ' s enzyme ACE2 weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients less serious than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-life protein coded orf3b and secret protein encoded orf8.
Protein orf3b of the SARS-CoV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenicity of the virus and suppress IFN exposure; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motivation.
On 18 February 2020, a team of authors headed by Chou (Zhou) submitted reports on the Cryoelectronic Tomography of a fully dispersed man ' s enzyme ACE2 with 2.9 ° in a complex with the transport of amino acid B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed information, was assembled as a dimer and that ACE2-B0AT1 could link two S-protein, which is evidence of the recognition and infection of the crownvirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for a medical screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were volatile mouses from which the virus was transmitted to man through the cive and camels, respectively.
Through a philogenetic comparison, SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus were found to be the first SARS-CoV-2 masters of flying mouses, since the new virus was 96% identical to the two SARS coronaviruses, namely the coronaviruses of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate owner has become, which has helped the virus to overcome the kind of barrier and to contaminate the human being; the path of transmission is also still to be found.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the virus transceivers from flying mice to man became snakes, in which there was a homologic recombination in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that the Pangolins are long-distant mammals, who feed on ants and who are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this suggestion is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangolin crownerium and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between both genomes is still very large, so the final results with specific evidence are not yet available (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely still unknown.
In the laboratory environment, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive within 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50% of humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; efficiently block the activity of the virus can be ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlor-containing disinfecting substances, peruxus acid, chloroform and other fatal solvents, but not chlorhexydin.
The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are receptive to the new virus.
Currently, there are no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to the earlier studies of other coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure 4).
As a general rule, the owner's virus first recognizes the inborn immune system through the image-recognizing receptors (RRMs), including receptors of S-type Lectin, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus promotes inflammation, dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferones, which prevent the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophases against virus antigens.
However, thanks to the N white SARS-CV, it is possible to avoid immune reaction.
A adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the protection of the organism.
The CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of special antibodies in B cells and the CD8+ T cells directly kill those affected by the cell virus.
T-helpers produce anti-exhalation cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the cronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T-cells by causing their programmed loss.
Immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, MERS-CoV has been neutralized by the antibodies allocated to the recovering patient.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system entails a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious injury to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, lead to polyorganal inadequacy and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cluster, is more likely to affect older persons with accompanying pathology and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have immune violations.
According to data studies for the first 425 cases of infection in Huhan, the calculated average SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases revealed that the average incubation period lasted three days, with a dispersion of between 0 and 24 days.
A later study based on the data of the demographic 8,866 cases revealed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those who have an unsymptomous flow of the disease.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with a virus or infected with a virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often the high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, contaminated breathing, muscular pain, headache, throat, throat, chest pain, diarrhea, boil and vomit.
Some patients had a breath and (or) hypoxia a week after the start of the disease.
In difficult cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for early diagnosis, even if there are no pathologies on breast photographs.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent leather and 3 per cent diarrhea; 8 per cent of patients needed artificial venting.
Similar results were derived from two recent studies of domestic infections and the transmission of the virus from unsimthetic infections.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98%), dry coughs (47%) and rest (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required an artificial venting of lungs, which is much higher than that of patients from COVID19, and corresponds to a higher MERS mortality rate than with COVID-19.
The patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and pain in the throat (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperatures (99-100 per cent), dry coughs (29-75 per cent), rest (40 - 42 per cent), diarrhea (20 - 25 per cent) and throat pain (13 - 25 per cent), and pneumonia ventilation is 14 - 20 per cent.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Compared to this, SARS mortality rate was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases by November 2002.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed deaths.
As a result of a more early study, the reference rate of reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47, with 95 per cent of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for the new virus is lower than the last two.
Thus, the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Classes often occur when infected within one family or group of people gathered together for any reason or were together on a cruise liner, such as on a cruise liner.
Patients were often travelling to Uhang, or to other affected regions, living there or in contact with the infected or sick during the last two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be present without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been cured can again be a bearer of the virus, and this is an alarming signal of the extension of the quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or lower number of white cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheric blood.
For example, 1,099 patients from COVID-19 had lymphopia with 4x109/L levels of leukocytes, including 1×109/L, as well as a higher level of aminotransfers and viruses.
In the blood of some patients, higher levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were detected, and most patients had higher levels of S-reactive protein and erythrocytes in their blood.
The level of D-dimer in patients with severe leakage, the product of fibrine in the blood, has been increased and the number of lymphocytes has decreased steadily.
Most of the patients from COVID19, in X-ray chest study, have detected pathologies characterized by uneven eclipses on both sides or eclipses of the type of volatile glass in the lungs.
Patients often develop a typical pneumonia, acute pneumonia, and acute respiratory disease (ODS).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant gas exchange disruption.
The dispersion of type I and II pneumonic cells reduces surface-active compounds and increases surface tensions, thereby reducing the ability of the light to expand and increasing the risk of declining the lungs.
Thus, the worst results of the X-ray study are often the same as the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the humidity of pneumonic cells, the formation of hyalin membranes and interfluorocaric infiltrasis, and the multinuclear syncitial cells in the light patients who died from the disease corresponded to the pathology of virus infection and ODS and similarly found from SARS and MERS patients.
The COVID-19 method of detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used as the main criterion for diagnosing the diagnosis by means of a polymeralized chain reaction with reverse transciptasis (TCP with reverse transciptasis).
However, given the high level of false results that can accelerate the epidemic, the diagnosis has begun in China since 13 February 2020 on the basis of clinical manifestations (not relying exclusively on the PCBs with the reverse transcryptaz).
The situation with SARS was similar.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, Mr. Feng Zhang, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the protocol for the application of SHERLOCK-repetition methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows for the identification of synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA with density of 20 x 10-18 m/l up to 200 x 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of the reference model) with the help of indicators strips less than in hours without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if successfully tested in clinical medicines, can significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of tests.
Owing to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown crown-viruse, doctors are mostly able to provide patients with COVID-19 only supporting therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or proposed for treatment by other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virusive drugs, immunity applicants, steroids, the plasma of recovering patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of the surviving patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies rush to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the initial phases of SARS-CoV-2, it is mostly light and may be less affected by other bodies expelling ACE2, such as venom and kidneys.
Nevertheless, the disruption of work and the refusal of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of the death of patients.
Thus, support for breathing function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical valence of lungs, which are assigned according to the gravity of the disease, is critical for facilitating symptoms and saving lives.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracoordinate membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modified extrapulmonary blood transfusion techniques used for treatment that pose a threat to the life of heart or respiratory inadequacy.
In addition, the maintenance of water balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks and the protection of functions of vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokin storm is the result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The Cytokin Storm is the form of a system-wide inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNה and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of ODS and polyorganal inadequacy.
The suppression of immunity is essential in the treatment of the cytokin storm, especially patients in difficult condition.
Corticosteroids and tocilysumab were used to treat the cytokin storm, monochlonal antibodies serving as an inhibitor of interleikin 6.
Other methods for treating cytokin storms based on suppression of immunity include the immune response modules aimed at controlling T cells; the IFN-, IL-1 and TNF cytokines blockade; the denial of Janus-Kinasa; the use of blitumomaba, 4 cytokin signal subpressors and Hystondeatelaza inhibitors.
To reduce the gravity of the effects of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity providers.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit in treating severe pulmonary damage to patients from SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which deteriorate significantly.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium-sized dossiers are recommended to be applied with caution in the treatment of patients from COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no validated antivirus therapy.
However, the intravenous introduction of a nucleotide analog has proved to be effective treatment by a U.S. patient with COVID19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat Ebola viruses and the Marburg virus.
Subsequently, the Remdesivir also demonstrated the possibility of oppressing other viruses with one-chain RNAs, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, Gilead has provided the Chinese medicinal composition for a pair of studies on patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and is looking forward to the results of these studies.
In addition, barricininib, α-interferon, latinauir/ritovire and fishermen were proposed as options for therapy of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lupinvira/ritonvira may be accompanied by diarrhea, boil, vomit, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
The plasma of survivors and the development of antibodies
Blood heating from contagious patients has long been used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect the healthy population.
And in fact, the blood of the recovering patients often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antitela is in an immunoglobulin produced by B-limphocytes to combat pathogens and other alien objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and addressably neutralize them.
Based on this prerequisite, a plasma was made available from the blood samples of a group of patients cured of COVID19, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
During the 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation decreased, their virus load increased, and blood saturation increased with oxygen.
However, it is still necessary to suggest that this method be used extensively before a specific therapy is carried out.
In addition, in the light of the therapeutic effect, some deficiencies related to the use of plasma should be carefully explored.
For example, antibodies can exacerbate the immune system and cause cytokini emissions syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually not high, and the plasma for patients in critical condition requires much.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies enough quickly to overcome the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify B-cells of recovered patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of virus.
So we can go to the mass antibodies production right away.
For thousands of years, Chinese used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs according to the diagnosis of the disease based on theory of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective COVID-19 specific therapy, Chinese traditional medicine is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light and medium-sized symptoms or for patients who recover after a serious illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lyan Hua Zin Wen (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were recognized as effective in the treatment of COVID19.
The largest percentage of surviving patients from COVID-19 was in several provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for 87 per cent of patients, including Hannes (63.7 per cent), Ninz (50 per cent) and Hunaj (50 per cent), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment only about 30 per cent of COVID-19 patients, the lowest (13 per cent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, since the evaluation should take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the level of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials comparing treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment for Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the deadlines for normalization of the body temperature, the removal of symptoms and the provision of medical care in the condition of the stationary were fewer for patients who were treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than for patients who were treated only in Western medicines.
The most remarkable is the fact that the proportion of patients who have begun to deteriorate the symptoms (from light to heavy) has been lower in a group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group treated only by Western medicine (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the death rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely monitored research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
There is also some interest in obtaining, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and explaining the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed by COVID19 are mostly feared of acute or even deadly disease, and people closed to quarantine are also bored, lonely and extremely irritated.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxy and cough, as well as by-products, such as corticosteroid sleeplessness, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
At the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotoral incitement, psychotic symptoms, deliria and even suicide.
Mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and guilt related to the spread of infection, quarantine and social climes on their families and friends.
Psychiatric and psychiatric assistance should therefore be provided to patients with COVID19, persons suspected and contacted, as well as to all the others required.
Within the framework of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric assistance brigades should be formed, clear information should be made with regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from animal bears of infection and infected persons to sensitive hosts and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work was undertaken on the establishment of S-protein-based vaccines aimed at developing long-term and highly active antibodies and (or) protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal vaccines from SARS viruses have been developed in the course of animal research.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in the natural environment must be determined in the case of aged patients, the model for the infection of deadly doses and the degree of protection against the infection of zone viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new case has ever been reported since then.
At the same time, there are still sporadic cases and clusters of MERS disease originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions through the conservation of zoos in endemic habitats.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactive virus, DNA plasmid, virus vectors, nano-parties, virus particles and recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated for animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task requiring a solution to curb the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long term (average of 18 months) required to develop the vaccine and the dynamic change of the crown-viruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical flow of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also linked to high complications and high deaths among patients with severe illnesses.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a preventive model of the disease in order to prioritize the measures they take, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be associated with patients ' forecasting of the disease from COVID19 (table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the forecasting of the disease caused by the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mostly affects patients between 30 and 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
The patients required intensive therapy were more likely to have basic diseases and complications, and they were much older than those patients who did not need such treatment (average 66 years versus 51 years), which shows that age is a prognotic factor for patients with COVID19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100 000 vs. 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Illness and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop a severe damage to myocardium and arithmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to ACE2-Cholangiocytes, which could cause a liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and initial diseases are closely interrelated and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the gravity of the inflammatory process or damage to tissues and is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the flow of disease, therapy responses and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the level of the disease and the projection of COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, a higher level of lactatdehydrogenasas, amino transferazas, alanin amino transferazas and creatinkinas can be predicted.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and their emissions occur when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally cardiovascular or liver disorder markers.
Main clinical symptoms: In order to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID19, data on the X-ray study of the breast and the development of clinical symptoms should be taken into account in addition to other factors.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunities that are widely used in infectious diseases as supplementary therapy to reduce the gravity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors have developed avascular osteonecrosis, which has caused life disability and low quality of life.
Thus, if necessary, steroids for patients from COVID-19 should be used in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, to cope with high degrees of uncertainty and to observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
In order to reduce stress in such patients and help them to get back to normal life, they must be given psychological advice and long-term support.
According to the demographic studies currently undertaken, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to reproducing in lower respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronavirus that cause normal cold diseases, can breed successfully in upper breathing paths and cause weak symptoms or at all cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients with an early or incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus to a large extent, making it difficult to control epidemiologically.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CV virus occurs when patients are severely ill, with the fact that in most cases there were no early infections.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently undertaking a great deal of work in which the general quarantine has been declared in Uhaan and neighbouring cities, as well as extending the carantine regime for almost all the population to break the chain of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have caused enormous damage to the economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients identified is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate of the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the phase of draining will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hanter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which seemed much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model to forecast the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world ' s population.
The Canadian Team of Specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat masks taken from patients who had recovered and handed out of hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to that of flu.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, pointing out that the strategies currently applied may have been exerted.
According to the initial projections, Ebola fever was to strike up to a million people and cause half a million deaths.
But the disease was eventually controlled by severe quarantine and isolation.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened and that it will disappear or become a less pathogeneous virus coexisting with man over time.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or chewing, as well as possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated by the virus.
The virus was also detected in the potassium, which means that the oral fecal method is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 students may have been exposed to infections in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautionary measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreigners, who contact or are infected.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wear of masks for the person; and surgical masks and respirators of class N95 (Seria No. 1860s) help to monitor the spread of viruses.
Surgeon masks prevent microcapples from flying away from potentially infectious in the air and from situating on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the surroundings.
However, only N95 (Seria No. 1860s) masks can protect from the inhalation of virians of 10 to 80 nm, they only pass 5 per cent of viruses; SARS-CV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks combined, medical personnel directly contacting patients must wear N95 (Seria No. 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective garbage placed on the figure in order to further reduce contact with viruses.
Virus can also go into the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor had been infected by SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; perhaps the virus had been caught in the body through the inflammated eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent personal shields or protected glasses of a closed type.
All populations in the affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands with demonizing means, to avoid leaving home by self-inclusion and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
An acceptable distance to the patient is estimated to be about a meter distance.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, the high degree of similarity with SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a alarming signal to China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Disease Control in Huhan calmed the citizens, noting that the new virus had a low degree of contagiousness and limited reproduction in the transfer from human beings to human beings and that prevention and control would not be a problem.
This statement has greatly reduced social tensions, especially when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of Chinese New Year, and the critical time had been lost when the disease could be curtailed within Uhaan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this drastic lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information from the clinic rather than await formal reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to deter the potential epidemic at early stages of its development rather than to calm the public; and (4) conduct more focused and effective teachings to raise awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve public response.
The COVID-19 flash caused by a previously uneducated coronavirus of a severe second-type acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease reached the whole of China and spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms COVID19 are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a sense of recidivy of SARS emerged at the outbreak of COVID-19.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant in terms of controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 hit older persons to a greater extent than young people and men than women; the proportion of serious cases and deaths among older persons is also higher than among young people.
Mortality resulting from SARS is higher than in COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients from COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomally flown, while SARS patients usually infect the surgeon only in severe cases, so it is more difficult to control the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This in part explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading far faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients from COVID-19 may have negative normal samples for SARS-CoV-2 RNAs.
On the other hand, healed patients can show positive tests on the virus again.
All of this greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
In the background of such rapid progress in research, COVID-19 remains unresolved by some of the most important issues, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronaviruses of volatile mice, we still cannot argue that SARS-CoV-2 infections were from flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate species that passed the virus from the original master, such as flying mice, to man?
Not knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely break the path of transfer, and the epidemiological environment can increase at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how is the virus being introduced into respiratory cells and leading to further pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically in the process of transferring human to human beings?
Will it cause the world pandemic, also disappear like SARS or relapse periodically like the influenza?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but time will take to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
The Zoonic Origin of the Human Crown of the Crown
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronaviruses (CoV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, it was known that two human coronavirus (HCV) caused a light disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our view of how catastrophic and life-threatening a person’s contamination can be.
The emergence of the coronavirus of the second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 has again attracted attention to the coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission rate, but weaker the pathogenicity of the virus than that of the SARS-CoV.
Human coron-virus infection is a zoonosis, and understanding of its zoning origin will be very useful.
Most of the coronavirus of man come from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate reserves of some human crownivers are also known.
The definition of animal bearers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronavirus can also shed light on the pathogens of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zooning origin and ways of inter-personal communication.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing the different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the coronavirus disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also addressed.
In addition, the conditions needed for a successful change in the carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the gravity of the disease.
Coronaviruses are part of the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of siege viruses with one positive polar line of RNA.
These viruses with the largest RNAs containing genome containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides have been called because of their form, which, when an electronic microscope is examined, resembles a crown.
In terms of structure, the coronavirus have unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading limits (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast into polyproteins of replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further reprocessed to generate 16 non-structured proteins marked by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including chiposic protein (S), hull protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of linear excels have also been encoded in other coronaurus lines.
On the basis of differences in protein sequences\ coronavirus are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and deltakoranvirus), with the type of betacoroneviruses consisting of the majority of human crowners and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha- and betacoronviruses are volatile mouses and gnaws, whereas birds are the main reservoir for gamma and deltacoronevirus.
For thousands of years, the coronavirus have been constantly overcoming inter-vident barriers, some of which have evolved to dangerous pathogens for human beings.
To date, seven human coronaviruses have been known.
These include human alphabetical viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronevirus include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CV), the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CV) and the coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of type II SARS-CoV-2.
Human crowners HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light form, such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogens, causing severe communicable communicable diseases of lower respiratory paths in relatively larger patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory disease (ODS) and extra-legal symptoms.
The first human coronavirus HCV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients who had a cold disease in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has provided more detailed knowledge of HCV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses, which are causing local infection symptoms.
Indeed, before the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a commonly accepted concept that human envelope was generally considered harmless.
The SARS flash in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; over 8,000 people were ill and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spread sporadically to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus found in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID19), which, as at 3 March 2020, lost more than 3,20 lives and over 91,000 infected persons.
An alarm was received and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus have a zoonic origin, and their sources are volatile mouses, mouses, or domestic animals.
Many data sets are evidenced in favour of the evolutionary nature of all human coronaviruses from volatile mice to organisms in which viruses are well adapted and which do not display pathogenic properties but demonstrate widespread genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zoning mechanism of the origin of the human coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-violent transfer.
It may also prompt or expedite the search for a container, an intermediate and amplified SARS-CoV-2 medium, which is essential to preventing the re-proliferation of the disease in the future.
This review provides general information on zoos, inter-violent transfer and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirus have occurred are usually not pathogens for their reservoirs, but become pathogenic after the inter-видic transfer of the new bearer.
We also analyse the trend in the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also considered in the same context.
The animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Before the strain of B814 HCV-229E was first received from a sample of patients who had a cold strain, various coronavirus were found from different infected animals, including indices, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
Table 1 provides a brief and informative history of the discovery of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCV-229E was obtained from samples taken from respiratory paths of patients with infectious upper respiratory paths in 1966; further, the virus was adapted to the reproduction of pulmonary cells WI-38.
The patients infected with HCV-229E had cold symptoms, including headaches, chewing, general incapacity and pain in the throat, with high temperature and coughing occurring from 10 to 20 per cent of the cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was released from an organic culture and a subsequent serial passage to the brain of mice-susks.
Clinical signs of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to HCV-229E virus infections, which are not distinct from other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza viruses of type A and rinvirus.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are spread throughout the world and are typically transmitted in winter in moderate latitudes.
The most incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
Research by volunteers shows that healthy people infected with HCV-229E have developed a common cold of light form.
Only a few patients with weak immunity had severe infectious lower respiratory paths.
The SARS explosion, also known as the “Atypical Pneumonia epidemic”, was the first pandemic well documented by the human crownerium, and the instigator of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the human crowners identified.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and across continents.
Without the exception of super-active distributors, it was calculated that each patient could contract about two more; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days and the peak of the virus load was 10 days.
The patients infected by SARS-CV initially suffered from pain in muscles, headaches, high temperatures, general malnutrition and retardation, while later symptoms included breathing, cough and breathing shortages.
Laboratory deviations from SARS are lymphopies, liver breaks and a higher level of creatinkinase.
Patients with SARS also experience diluted alveolar damage, epitelial cells proliferation and macrophagus increases.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients later need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of lungs.
In such difficult cases,\ in addition to the lower respiratory paths may also be infected by other bodies, including stomach, liver and kidney organs, which are usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with weak immunity.
For the first time, the virus was released from the open biopsy of a patient’s relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to study the human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
First, it was found that it was largely affecting young children, older persons and patients with weak immunity and respiratory diseases.
For the HCV-NL63 disease, there are such symptoms as moisture, conjunctiveity, high temperature and bronchiolith.
Another independent study describes the distribution of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an eight-month boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it is actually widespread.
HCOV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases and the peak of the diseases caused by them occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to an excellent laringit, which is also called a cerebral.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolith.
In addition to non-pollutant pneumonia and bronchiolith, HCOV-HKU1 is linked to aggravating astmatic diseases.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, a respiratory disease that causes light forms, has been detected worldwide.
All these four coronavirus of persons causing extracurricular infections have been well adapted to people and their mutation, resulting in high-pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents have been unknown as a rare example of a more virulent HCOV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious communication of lower respiratory paths in China.
These human crownivers are usually less virulent or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to communicate effectively and maintain themselves in the body.
The coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first allocated to Saudi Arabia for the first time in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal inadequacy.
Most of the laboratory cases have been confirmed in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there have been hostage and distribution through episoded secondary infections with close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — a progressive acute pneumonia for both infections.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal deficiencies, which still distinguishes MERS from the remaining diseases caused by crown-viruses transmitted to man.
More than 30 per cent of patients have diarrhea and voracy symptoms.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryally confirmed cases of high-mortality Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent), therefore MERS-CoV is considered to be one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
Between mid-December and late, 2019, the Hubei Province of China identified a group of patients with pneumonia, which is now associated with the infection caused by the coronavirus of the severe acute respiratory syndrome of 2 type (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of infectious bottom respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global emergency in the field of public health, and the disease itself was called “COVID-19 corrosive infection”.
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were reported worldwide, with about 3.4 per cent mortality.
It should be noted that the death rate is 4.2 per cent in the Hubei Province of China and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronavirus, causes heavy respiratory infections with temperature, cough and breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute breathing deficiency syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high nucleotide sequence homology (82 per cent), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of philogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has more transfer capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsymptomal SARS-CoV-2 infections have been recorded, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
Comparisons and comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six human coronaviruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, the coronavirus transmitted to man have similar incubation periods and the duration of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, for the degree of gravity of COVID-19 symptoms, there are between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus that cause non-pollutional infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those most commonly observed in human coronavirus infections, including non-special infections, light symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in SARS-CV infections, a small subgroup of serious COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Thirdly, SARS-CoV-2 also refers to interesting patterns of both human coronavirus and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus, causing non-pollutional infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. every next person) as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that cause extracurricular infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in samples of cala.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral path of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The question of possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by human coronavirus, causing extra-curricular infections, is also of particular interest.
Nevertheless, the future development of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogens and sustainable proliferation after human transition.
All four human coronavirus, which cause extra-curricular infections with light-form symptoms, have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, it may have been people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both can be described as the only survivors of the pandemic of human coronavirus in the past.
Human coronavirus that cause serious diseases in humans and people who have human coronavirus caused serious diseases have simply failed to survive.
In order to do so, the human coronavirus must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations against the driver ' s limitation factors.
In that sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 will continue and the more people will be infected, the more chance that the virus will be fully adapted to human beings.
If it is adapted well, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to people by carantine or other controls of infectious diseases.
Over the years, the population has been circularing four extra-cultural coronavirus that cause a common cold among people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
High-patogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coroners have not adapted to human beings sufficiently, and their transfer to people cannot be supported.
They need to be kept and reproduced in their zoning pools and to look for chances of entering perceptive human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or reinforced carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features such as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCV non-pollutant viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as HCV extra-pollutant, at least at present.
But it's more pathogenic than non-pollutant HCV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to human beings and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a container or an intermediate animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforced and reservoired viruses of HCV.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCV if it transfers a naked ancestry with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
Ancestor virus is usually well adapted and nonpatogenic in this medium.
Similarly, the reservoir maintains HCV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural HCV wearers or parental virus.
Unlike this, if HCV was only placed in an intermediate medium right before or about the time the man was taken, it was not well adapted to the new wearer and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zonous source of human infection and play a reinforcing role as a medium, allowing the virus to be reproduced lightly and then transmitted to people by increasing the incidence of human infection.
HCV may carry the deadlock infection if it is unable to withstand the transmission inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses may also be adapted to the intermediate carrier and may even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural reservoir.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero SARS patient had contact with wildlife hunters in the anamnesia.
Further research on surfing has shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV virus is higher than that of the population as a whole.
The Gimalay Cigettes (Paguma larvata) and the notoвидal dog in the animal markets have become the first virus bearers, such as the almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, following the destruction of all the quotes in the markets, the cases of SARS were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cigarettes living in nature or in farms and not marketed in most cases SARS-CoV did not determine that the Himalayan cigarettes could only serve as an intermediate aggravating medium rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the various animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to exclude the likelihood that intermediate reinforcers can also serve many small mammals.
They all appear to be impassive bearers of the SARS-CoV virus.
Subsequent searches for natural SARS-CV animal bearers have identified a close-born CoV volatile mice, which has been called the atypical pneumonia-related coronarius of subcolocative volatile mice HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese swimming mice.
These mouses are positive to the antibodies of SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronavirus of volatile mice have 88 to 92 per cent of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that volatile mouses became the carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) have also been detected in volatile mice, but none other than one, which indicates WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
It is known that the receptor SARS-CoV is a human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from a sample of flying mice, used ACE2 volatile mice, cigarette and human as a receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, the serums of surviving patients from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV in volatile mice, dividing 95 per cent of nucleotide sequence homologies.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally not a direct parental virus of SARS-CoV, and volatile mouses are not a direct reservoir of SARS-CoV.
The Phylogenetic Analysis represents MERS-CoV to the same group as coV-HKU4 volatile mice and CoV-HKU5 volatile mice.
CoV-HKU4 volatile mice and MERS-CV use the same receptor of the medium, dipeptyl-diptiptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase of the MERS-CoV virus are philogeneticly closer to the sequences of the betacoroneviruses of volatile mice identified in Europe and Africa.
To date, wild volatile mice have not found the MERS-CoV virus alive.
The nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its nearest family member CoV-HKU25 coincide with only 87 per cent.
So the volatile mice might not be the direct reservoir bearer of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that the single-floor camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in humans, was identified from the nasal masts of one-rope camels, which further confirms the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that the camels who were experimented with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms but massive viruses.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have produced a virus not only by respiratory means but also by a fecal oral way, which is also the main means of providing the virus with volatile mice.
However, many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome still remain issues, as many of the confirmed cases have not had contact with camels before the symptoms arise and are likely to be related to human transfers or transfers by unknown channels, including unidentified species of MERS-CoV.
The nucleotide nucleotides SARS-CoV-2 coincides with the CoV RaTG13 volatile mice allocated to Rhinolophus affinis in Asia.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the diversgence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, the volatile mouses could not be the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronaries of volatile mice were found in the future.
Presumably, the direct animal bearers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus must be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Uhaan Opto market of the seafood, which has caused many initial cases of COVID-19, indicating the likely transmission from an animal person.
A number of recent studies based on metagenic sevenation concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as the Pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry a parent betacoronavirus, a family strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The nucleotide sequence of these new genomes is 85 to 92 per cent compared to SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also close to RaTG13, with the nucleotide sequence identity of about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two differentiational areas of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the philogenetic tree, one of which is more close to SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4 per cent identities.
Conversely, RSD strains of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of homology of sequence throughout the genome.
The early study of pangolins also reported the definition of viral contigues in lung samples that were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used other methods to collect and manually process a sequence of genome, which includes about 86.3 per cent of the full-fledged virus genome.
The possibility of pangolin becoming an intermediate animal bearer of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded.
However, as a result of diversification of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacorunirs of the Pangolins, the relatives of SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the pangolina.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacorn-viruses of the Pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established for volatile mice, pangolins and other mammals.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacorn viruses of the Pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide homology.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the betacorn viruses of the Pangolins, the relatives of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 relates to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite suggestion favours a recombination between the betacoronavirus of the Pangolins, the SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widespread among the betacorn viruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoo origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-patogenic HCV viruses, the zonosis of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCOV-NL63 and HCV-229E can occur from volatile mice crowns, while parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found in grits.
It was reported that the crownvirus of volatile mice, called ARCV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and identified at the North American three-coloured adjoining, showed a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically linked to another coronarius of volatile mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/192008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was suspicion that its intermediate wearer might be also camel.
To be clear, modern knowledge of the animal origins of known coronavirus is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The philogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the inter-personal transfer of HCV in the anamnase.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted inter-visually in 1890 and people were infected with domestic animals, a respiratory infection pandemic was registered.
The history of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
The alpha-coron viruses of volatile mice, NHCV-229E, were found.
There's an alpaca alpaca alpakis between them.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from volatile mice to man.
First, it was people, not the alpacas, who could contact volatile mouses in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alpacas.
Secondly, the alpha-coron viruses of volatile mice, related to HCV-229E, have varied and non-patogenic volatile mice, while the alpha-coron virus of the alpaki has caused a respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpakis was not discovered from wild animals.
Thus, the likelihood that the alpacians received an alpha-corruptial-virus, a relative of HCoV-229E, could not be excluded.
In fact, volatile mouses are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the virus of madness, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that mice could directly transmit HCV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while the alpha-coron viruses of volatile mice could serve as a gene pulse of HCV-229E, the alpacas and the one-round camels could be intermediate mediators that could transmit viruses to people, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-COV is a fine example of inter-visual transmission from volatile mice to camels and one-rope camels to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CV virus from volatile mice is known by its initial identification and was subsequently confirmed by subsequent studies.
Obviously, volatile mouses provide a rich pool of viral varieties for inter-visual exchange of manned fragments and inter-vident transmissions.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interactions and flying ability make flying mice “the ideal propagators”.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to the solo camels a decade ago.
He has adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate medium have become a stable and natural reservoir.
The MERS-CV virus in these animals causes a very light disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episoded transmission to a person is accidental, and the person remains the impasse bearer MERS-CoV because it is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the betacoroneviruses of pangolins are highly patogenic from the pangolins.
They may be impasse bearers of the betacorn-viruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as cives in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-sectoral transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals should be confirmed or deleted.
First, volatile mouses can be a reservoir for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
People can share ecological niche with volatile mouses through carbon production or the cutting of carcases of these animals.
Secondly, the pangolins may be one of the intermediate reinforcers to which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
People are infected with the virus through the cutting of carcases and the eating of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including households, are receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
Animals and animal surveys on antibodies are justified.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CV-2 could take place in a third form, which had been contacted both with volatile mouses and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to various types of animal bearers, three major factors from viruses have also contributed to crossing inter-speed barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with one-chain RNAs, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered as “a moderately high” replacement with an average frequency of approximately 10-4 replacements per year in one part 2, depending on the adjustment phase of the coronavirus to new masters.
Crown-viruses have corrective extortion, which leads to extremely high mutation and weakening or even incapacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog Remdeciviir suppresses the replication of the coronaviruses by injecting this extortionbonuclea and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymeras.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2 that need to be verified in clinical studies.
Nevertheless, the mutation rate of the coronaviruses is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronavirus are not well adapted to the wearer.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to human beings.
This virus is supposed to have adapted to another person's handbag.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-rope camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and anti-viral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 would quickly lose efficiency as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in the coronaviruses leads to more genomic modifications to mutation and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-viral coevolution that is conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
Many unique open reading and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3-end genome contribute to this.
Thirdly, because of the unique matrix selection mechanism, the cronaviruses are random and often switching matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcribing of the DNA of the crownvirus in the wearer, which serves as a mixture receptacle, the filament is often switched.
High-made full-performance and sub-generated RNAs can recombine and create new crown-viruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found both in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in coronavirus animals such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Interaction of the carrier with regard to transmission
In addition to the three above-mentioned virus factors, another key factor important for inter-visual transmission is the interaction of the virus with the receptacle.
This article provides a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-vident transfer events, by a recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between SARS-CV strains of human beings and cive, SARS-CoV is considered to be rapidly adapted in different media, especially with regard to RSD protein S mutations.
In general, S coronavirus protein is interacting with the cell receptor, and the antibodies of the wearer are intensively picking it up.
The SARS-CoV RSD is amino acids, from 318 to 510, on S1, which is linked to angiotensing enzyme 2 (APF2) as well as to corregenders for the introduction of the virus into the cell.
The SARS-CV virus is able to recognize APF2 receptors of various animals, including volatile mouses, cives, mouses and notoвидal dogs, making the virus possible for inter-visual transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been detected in the RSD, which differ from the human virus strains and the cive, four of which are in the recipe-binding motivation for interaction with the APF recipe.
SARS-CoV cive has the K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which may increase the affinity of the interaction of the schiposic protein with the human receptor of APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids can be particularly important for adapting the virus to human beings.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30 per cent between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S leads to a change in the affinity of S to human APF2.
Indeed, a Cryoelectron microscope study says that the affinity of this link is 10 to 20 times higher than between APF2 and S S virus SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to know whether any other roots were required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also linked to APF2 but to another segment of protein S.
There are many other receptors of HCV, such as amino-peptideza N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-ocethyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to people after inter-violent transfers from animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of inter-speed HCV transfer is also governed by other dependencies and limitations on the carrier.
The divergence of these proteins between people and natural reservoirs of HCVs, such as volatile mouses, single-strong camels and gnaws, can be a barrier to inter-personal transmission.
In order to successfully transfer HCV viruses, it is necessary to substantiate dependency factors and to subscribe to driver resurgence.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be achieved by an impartial full-generated screening of the dependency and resurgence factors for SARS-CoV-2 through the latest technology of CRISPR.
New HCV: back to zero
The variety of volatile mice crowns creates a wide range of opportunities for new HCVs.
In this sense, the coronavirus of volatile mice serves as a genetic bullet for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCV evolution and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotics.
Accessor proteins SARS-CoV are considered important for human adaptation, since volatile mice viruses, related to SARS-CoV, have been isolated, but it is determined that they codify the diegant proteins of ORF8.
In the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotid delegation characterized by SARS-CoV crowners was discovered.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be adaptive mutation, which accelerates the replacement of the carriers.
In addition, SARS-CV has a history of possible alpha- and gamma-corruption recombinations, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerage.
The localization of the recombination was also identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CV had been subjected to a recombinant between the different lines, which had occurred in the solemn camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs, in which HCV was recombined with other animal crowners in its non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial segregation can contribute to unintentional changes in virus genomes, which is likely to occur as a result of the release of the virus from selective pressures, such as by the immune system of the carrier.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-fledged ORF4 in a prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to a two-nucleotid delegation.
While an instinct open reading box of ORF4 can be observed from the volatile mouse and camel-kind HCV-229E viruses, the alpha-corruption of the alpha-carovirus shows a single-nucleotide insertion, which leads to a shift of frames.
Finally, the evolution of new HCV is also due to the selection pressure on their reservoirs.
When infected with volatile mice, croneviruses recorded weakly expressed symptoms or lack of them, which suggests reciprocal adaptation between coronavirus and volatile mouses.
It turns out that the volatile mouses are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the coronaviruses.
For example, defects in the activation of provocative responses in volatile mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in volatile mice is suppressed by the apregulation of the inhibitor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of exposure of molecules of the main gyto-compatibility complex of Class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which is provided with high metabolic activity of volatile mice, can suppress the replication of the crownvirus while influencing the exoriginal immunocratic reading, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of virus strains that, when entering the new medium, are highly patogenic.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or proteins to adapt the medium.
Thus, it is no coincidence that in the last twenty years there have been three new coronaries of man.
Coronations are nonpatogenic or cause light symptoms in their reservoirs, such as volatile mouses or camels.
They reproduce confidently without causing a strong immune response from the carrier.
That is the secret of why we see the unsimtomal carriers, and what is causing serious cases of human infection.
Heavier symptoms are mainly related to hyperactivity of immune response and a cytokin storm, with more immune response, the more severe pneumonia.
On the contrary, the immune response of the unsimpert bearers does not involve the replication of the crownvirus.
The same non- immune response strategy may have favourable effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The volatile mice has a particularly powerful interfering response.
Thus, the acceptance of type I interferone, at least at the start phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, should have a favourable effect.
In addition, NLRP3-inflammass activation has been violated in volatile mice.
As a result, the NLRP3-inflamma through MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 was followed by a common pattern on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV had emerged.
While a betacoronvirus of volatile mice, whose nucleotide homology coincides with SARS-CoV, there is also a volatile mice crown, whose nucleotide homology coincides with 96% of SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cigarettes and other animals in the market carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, there have been no directly intermediate mediums for SARS-CV-2.
The betacoronavirus of the pangolin was discovered, amazingly homological SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the Pangolins could serve as an intermediate carrier or that fragments of the genes of the betacoronevirus pangolines could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
The Crown Viruses have attracted universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
A study of coronavirus in volatile mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zonous origin and of HCV animals in human transfer.
Convincing evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated from flying mice and was transmitted to the person through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CV infection occurs from contact between people and cigarettes in markets, the closure of the wild markets and the destruction of the cigarettes on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of betacoronvirus lines of pangolins, close-born SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed in order to prevent the zoo transfer of infection from products markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to people through pangolins and other mammals and how this can be done remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CV virus has long existed in one-foot camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, all camels cannot be donated to control MERS, as was done in China ' s wild animal markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to halt the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels, combined with other infectious controls.
Since we cannot address these viruses, new genetypes can emerge from outbreaks of disease.
The world is circulating a variety of zonous crownivers.
In particular, there are extremely varied coronaviruses of volatile mice with zoning potential.
There is a great variety of opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zonous crownivers, which will in the future lead to the emergence of new crown-viruses, which are easier to pass and (or) more deadly to human beings.
In order to reduce the number of surplus contacts between people and animals, a culture of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
Following severe tests, the SARS, MERS and COVID19 have to be better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be captured.
Although many of the properties of volatile mice are conducive to the spread of viruses, by teaching people to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with volatile mouses and other species of wild animals can be minimized.
Continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the crownivers and their natural carriers, which will be useful to prevent the transfer of coronavirus from animals to man and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zoonosis is to keep people away from the natural niches of zoo viruses.
SARS-CoV-2 still lacks some fragments in the zoos.
First, if the volatile mouse passed an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the volatile mouses and the pangolins divide the same niche.
Secondly, if volatile mouses play a more direct role in the transfer of human beings, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with volatile mouses.
Thirdly, if the real intermediate medium plays a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including human beings, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and pilot infections should be carried out.
Whether the flying mouse, pangolin or other mammals are expected to be identified by their natural carriers in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its predecessors viruses.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
The diagnostic criteria for “suspected suspects” and “approved cases” COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a brief background manual on diagnosing and treating the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCOV), which provides information on our experience and recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, cronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and present the latest diagnostic criteria for “subjects to suspicion of disease” and “approved cases” in accordance with the “Dagnostic and therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of the CIS.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus disease itself was referred to as “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference manual and published it on the Internet on the website of the Journal of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
While noting that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven editions of the paper “Recommendations on diagnostic and therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of the CPD (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), some of its provisions changed significantly.
Recently, the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) and the sponsors provided comments on our recommendations, which contained simple proposals for diagnosis based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has provided valuable background information on this pandemic of the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the last edition of the “Diagnostic and therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (test version seventh) and the results of the ongoing studies, and their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (Dec. 3 March 2020), a single element of epidemiological history with two clinical diseases must be merged in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis in confirmation of suspicion of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in Uhan and its surroundings or in other human settlements where COVID-19 has been reported 14 days before symptoms; (2) the history of contact with patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acids); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhang and its surroundings or from other human settlements where COVID-19 has been reported during the last 14 days before symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (such as 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms recorded for 2 weeks in small areas such as house or apartment, office, class in school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external infections of COVID19; (3) the total number of white cells is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for the confirmed disease should be based on the case of suspicion of a disease with one of the following points of patogenetic or serological evidence, namely: (1) the real-time PCB test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genetic sequencing of the virus shows the high homogenicity of the new coronaviruses; (3) the positive results of the serothetic for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antitellites for specific SARS-CoV-2; or the change of the result of the test with a negative impact on the specific SARS-CoV-2 antithelabs of IgG, or the increase of the titra at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the appropriate performance phase.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020), a real-time PCB test for nucleic acids in respiratory paths or blood samples was added.
Patogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and in the fifth issue (8 February 2020); the seventh edition added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers seeking optimal sets for detecting nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as the analysis of samples from respiratory paths, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the criteria for the confirmation of the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with aтипic symptoms and patients without expressive symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) et al. should be updated, as persons without clinical symptoms are classified as “low risk”.
The evaluation system also requires clarification of further clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspected suspicion” and “approved cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner with a view to providing effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19 — day-to-day maximum
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID19 a day.
It's the largest number of deaths from the virus a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Research of Diseases (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases were reported, as well as 33 patients living at home.
A total of 17 deaths were registered.
In Briffa, director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two dead were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 and one were 41 to 50 years of age.
She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaki.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
A clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadol that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitri Quai Clinic.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and the Bridges of Bangladesh, Obidul Kwader, said that public transport would be terminated for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport has been stopped since 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential goods — medicines, fuels and foodstuffs — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID19 were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March with two returnees from Italy, as well as with a wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people have already been cured.
SARS-CoV-2 has overlapped the millions of infections worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cronavirus infections in SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded 1 million.
COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
Rube came on the same day when the first infection was confirmed in Malawi, and Zambia registered the first death of the crownavirus.
North Korea argued that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries where no crown-virus infections had been recorded.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of contamination, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of crown-virus infection were reported in the United States, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, with reference to John Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday as a result of coronary infection.
Countries around the world have announced an increase in measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, prolonged the self-isolation regime for the citizens of the city until 1 May.
Previously, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-isolation, would receive wages up to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of an extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote “opposing”.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in the sacred towns of Mecca and Medin for a full day, while the curfew was only 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. before.
Thailand planned to enter a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the state ' s domestic self-isolation regime was extended by orders until May 1.
Cargoes in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian Woolworths shops and knights have reduced the amount of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at all the country stores, to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a single package limit.
These limitations were reported in cash advertisements as well as on the Facebook web page.
Citizens were reportedly beginning to make emergency stockpiles because of the fear that COVID19 could lead to a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the number of toilet papers purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and knomers have already limited this number to 4 packages.
The merchandise network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that with the introduction of four packages, “in many shops, toilet paper is still being purchased too fast, one delivery over an hour”, and called such demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI, published on Tuesday, called this “unprecedented” trend.
According to the representative of Woolworths, sales increased sharply last week.
The Costco Magazine in Canberra also limited this number to two packages last week.
In order to fill the deficit, the kolden began to order larger batches of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional bids, while ALDI had made reserves for the special share of early marketing on the environment.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Riteller Association, reported that the Rittelers were trying to complete stocks, but this was difficult because the local authorities had restrictions on the travel schedule of trucks.
It looks forward to an increase in the value of products, as suppliers are trying to meet demand, but fewer offers are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, owing to stock depletion, some stores could not conduct environmental shares.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade at the University of Queensland on technology, explained that stores are filled every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a thunderstorm, so the number of stockpiles was small and the long rows of the toilet were left empty after the distribution of the goods, increasing the lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled, and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfecting tools could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the past environment, the manufacturer of the recycled toilet paper Who gives a Crap reported the end of the stock.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the Kleenex and Solaris Paper toilet producer also reported that they were working 24 hours a day to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined as a result of the absence of buyers in the week's day of work, some real estate sellers began to offer the first auctioners free toilet paper.
The fourth daily edition of the NT News, published in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to cut and use as toilet paper.
According to ABC report of 3 March, first shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items acquired, claiming that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfecting, gallantery, hand washing and torment.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British supermarket supermarket Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres toilet paper with two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the infectious disease pandemic COVID-19 caused by the Crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” only describes the extent of the disease rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are involved in identifying, testing, treatment, isolation of sick persons, monitoring and mobilizing their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned at both the alarming prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction”.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than the influenza has yet to be tracked since it emerged to continuous global proliferation”.
Mr. Hebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never observed the pandemic caused by the crownivus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of the disease as an emergency in the field of public health of international importance and then assigned a new status to it, the pandemic.
The Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchy, said of the outbreak: “This is only the beginning, it will be worse”.
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 COVID19 cases were reported on Thursday, and more than 4,600 people died.
The 2019-2020 cronavirus pandemic is the 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic of coronarius of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
An outbreak was detected in Ouhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID19 were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have been cured.
China ' s mortality rate is 4 per cent, while the world varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and hard breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distributor.
The period from the first symptoms to the peak is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive: recommended preventive measures include washing of hands, covering the mouth of cough, maintaining distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-insolvation of people suspected of their infection.
The authorities around the world responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, job risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread shortage of items compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
The Internet has begun to discriminate about the virus, to have cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people resembling them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there are significant cases of virus spreading.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy-industry enterprises, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Ouhan (the capital of Hubei), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation of the situation was initiated in early January 2020.
Cases of contamination were mainly related to the Huananian optical market, and therefore the virus is believed to have a zoonous origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, which is a recently opened virus that resembles the coronaviruses of the flying mouse, the coroners of the Pangolin and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the first case of the disease had arisen on December 1, 2019, and that the infected person had not visited the market since that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in the publication of the South China Office of the Morning Post, which was unchecked, it was suggested that the first infection case had occurred with the 55-year-old resident of Hubei on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had decreased, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly underestimated, inter alia, because of the many cases of underreported symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of youth infections, with 19-year-old patients representing less than 2.4 per cent of all cases worldwide, and the U.S. scientific adviser Patrick Vallans calculated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of people who have been checked at COVID19 and whose test has been positive under official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, a formal policy had been adopted requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on 16 March revealed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until 23 January, and that such unregistered patients had become a source of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy largely exceeded the number of reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure can be 5.7.
Most COVID-19 patients are well-being.
In others, more complex cases, the time from the beginning of the symptoms to the time of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent of which was 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those killed had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic were usually reported on deaths of patients with positive results of COVID tests carried out under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take account of dead persons who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID 4-5 times.
The Spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below the actuality”. His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States, which often occur in the pandemic, such as the pandemic H1N1 influenza, 2009; the first confirmed death was recorded in Ukhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was registered in the Philippines on February 1 and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were recorded outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths, and several methods were usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and the time of the disease; they also affect the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the outbreak of the disease and the population, such as age, gender and general health; the “death/morbidity” ratio represents the number of deaths diagnosed to the number of diagnosed infections during the specified interval.
According to the University of Jones Hopkins statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and contamination cases is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data differ in different regions.
In China, the ratio of deaths to morbidity decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those whose symptoms occur from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who have symptoms since 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of deaths due to the disease (CFR) of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of infectious (IFR) mortality, which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosed and unidentified) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time the disease is contaminated to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to estimates by the Centre for Evidence Medicine at the University of Oxford, the overall rate of death from the pandemic is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary testing for COVID-19 in Germany, as well as the statistical study that analyses the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be monitored.
The peak and the exact duration of the flash shall not be defined and may vary according to location.
Matice Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually go to the platoon, and then, when the number of available carriers ends, they begin to extinguish.
However, in the present situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when this will take place.”
The senior medical adviser of the Chinese Government, Jun Nanshang, states that “everything can end by June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to end the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study conducted by the Emperor College led by Nile Ferguson, “until vaccines (possibly 18 months or more) are to be established”, compliance with physical distance measures and other measures will be required.
William Shaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, says: “I don’t think that this coronavirus will ever disappear at all because it's so easily transmitted”, and that it “can turn into a seasonal disease, flashing every year.”
The virulentity of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID19 symptoms may be relatively non-special, and some infected people may suffer without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are higher temperatures (88 per cent) and dry coughs (68 per cent).
Fewer common symptoms include tiredness, respiratory wetness (slift), loss of humidity, breathing, pain in muscles and joints, pain in throat, headache, vomit, vomit, bloodguilt, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims that it is seriously ill with the development of breathing problems of approximately 1 in 6 persons.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list urgent symptoms, such as breathing difficulties, constant pain or breast pressure, sudden punctuation, problems of awakening and sinking of a person or lip, and, if these symptoms occur, it is necessary to seek immediate medical care, and further development can lead to heavy pneumonia, acute respiratory distrix syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may have unsyptomal, without any clinical evidence, but the results confirm the fact that they are infected, so doctors recommend that persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed to be severely monitored and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsimtomal fluctuations varies from several to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; until there is no complete clarity on the symptom of leaning, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed the symptom was 30 per cent initially and then dropped to 15 per cent.
Some details on the spread of the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released in the air together with cough, chirping or during conversation; close contact means contact in a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, droplets can be spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) in the open cough.
There are assumptions that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops dumped into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time, and that respiratory drops may also be generated when breathing, including during conversation, although the virus is usually not transported by air.
The drops may fall into the mouth or nose of the people nearby, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resilience (ASD), can lead to the dispersal of extraction products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if the person is concerned with the contaminated surface, including the skin, with subsequent touch to his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus can be transmitted through fecalia, but the risk of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of a fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CV-2. The virus is the most infected during the first three days of symptoms, although it can occur both before symptoms occur and at later stages of the disease.
There were cases where tests had been positive in testing three days before symptoms, which indicated the possibility of transmitting the virus to the symptoms expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryally confirmed cases of unsimpermal flows of disease, but some countries also detected cases of transmission from unsimplemented carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2 to 3 others; the virus is able to survive from hours to several days.
In particular, it has been found that the plastic surface (polypropiled) and the stainless steel (304) can live up to three days, the cardboard surface is one day, and the copper surfaces are up to four hours.
The data varied depending on humidity and temperature, however, and the benefits of COVID-19 were obtained from households and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as after contact with other surfaces that could be touched by contaminated people.
The severe acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new virus first found in three persons with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of the coronavirus, and the virus can be destroyed inside the human body by a domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is much like the original SARS-CoV.
It is expected to have a zonous origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it was genetically classified with the Betacoronavirus, the subgeneration of Sarbecovirus (cellline B), together with two other strains of volatile mice viruses.
At a holistic and genomic level, it is 96 per cent identical to the other coronavirus of the volatile mouse (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome of pangolin and human viruses.
The integer-genomic comparison to date showed that the largest percentage of the similarity (92 per cent) existed between the coronarius of the Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, but that was not enough to prove that the pangolins were intermediate hosts of the virus.
The virus can be diagnosed pre-recognised on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by analysis of a polymereal circuit response with reverse transcribing (RT-CP) of an infected secret or computer volume.
A study that compared the PCB and CTC methods used in Uhanes showed that the CTC was much more sensitive than the PCB, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincided with other pneumonia and disease flow processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first line testing method in COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and the first was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymerial chain response tests (RT-CPD) are conducted.
It can be carried out on respiratory tests and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of between hours and several days.
The test is usually used by rhino basket, although zev can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently accurate to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computer volumes (CTs) include asymmetrical peripheral musculiars by type of matine glass and the absence of pleural leopards.
The Italian radiological society is responsible for the development of an international database of photos of confirmed cases of contamination.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, the COVID-19 images not confirmed by the PCB tests have a limited clinical specificity.
A major study was carried out in China that compared the results of the CHC and PCD testing, and it was clarified that, although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be considered as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
X-rays and computer volumes have been developed for diagnosing the virus through artificial intelligence.
Strategies for prevention of transmission include maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mercury with dirty hands, use of coughing or chewing salfets, which should be thrown immediately after use.
Those who have already been infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated, and many Governments recommend that they refrain from any short-term visits to countries and areas affected by outbreak and limit the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus was able to spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed to the population, some members of which do not know where and how it was contaminated, and medical workers who care for patients who could be infected are encouraged to use standard precautionary measures, as well as precautionary measures in contact with other people and eye protection, and tracking contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens by their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that kind of monitoring of persons.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked to develop decisions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data — for example, record user closeness to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he is notified, and there are also unreasonable versions of how to prevent contamination, such as stripping his nose and his mouth, which is actually ineffective.
At present, there are no COVID-19 vaccines, although many organizations are working to create it.
To prevent the spread of the disease, hand washing is recommended.
CDC (Sicken Control and Disease Prevention Centre) also recommends that hands be washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting toilets or heavy hand pollution, as well as before food, after mortar, cough or chewing.
This is necessary because, outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens it to the protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends that hand-aid disinfectives be used with at least 60 per cent alcohol.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel, the disinfecting tool begins to operate a minute after the seizure) with 62 to 71 per cent ethanol, 50 to 100 per cent ispropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hip chlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen peroxide peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent iodine.
Other components, such as bensalconia chloride and chlorogexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that all spaces of such facilities, including cabinets, toilet, public space, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote control pulses and bankomates used by sick persons, should be disinfected if the COVID is suspected or confirmed in the institution, such as the office or day station.
Medical organizations recommend that the mouth and nose be covered by the elbow or salphet, when coughing or chewing, and that the hygienic items be removed immediately.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, since the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of extracts that are dispersed in the air when talking, chewing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virusologist from the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the inclination of people to their faces, and the touching of dirty hands is the main means of infection”. The masks are also recommended for caregivers who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who take care of a person from COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of a mask actually reduces the number of touches to the person.
Several countries have begun to call for medical masks in public places.
The CDC Centres, the United States, recommend wearing non-medical clothing masks. China has emphasized separately the importance of using single-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
It is recommended that Hong Kong wear a medical mask in public transport or in human places.
Thailand ' s health providers encourage people to make personal tissues in household conditions and to erase them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has committed all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million daily medical masks are produced from mid-March, all passengers in trains and coaches were required to use medical masks.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask on the street; those who cannot acquire masks were advised to sew them on their own in household conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a response to infection, aimed at reducing the spread of disease by minimizing close contacts among people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and trade centres.
People can use social distances while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding people's places, using uncontactive greetings and physical distances from others.
Many Governments in the regions, especially those affected by outbreak, are currently presiding or recommending social distances.
The maximum number of people that could be gathered at one place, as recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 (in regions where there was no COVID-19) to 50 and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings into groups involving more than two persons. Older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertonia and weakened immune system are at a high risk of severe infection. CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of disease in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the purpose of the measure to reduce physical contact in social relations, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood in such a way that people should be completely socially excluded, rather than being in contact with other people in alternative ways, and some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations were made to engage in sexual relations only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and you are confident that he has no virus and his symptoms.
Individuals with COVID19 and suspects of being infected are encouraged to be self-insulated in household conditions.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-inclusion, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory measures or have recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed on quarantine.
Persons in high-risk groups have been ordered by the worst quarantine.
Persons who may have been contacted by COVID-19 or who have recently visited a country or region affected by the epidemic were encouraged to find a quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreak include curbing the spread, suppression or mitigation of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as implies other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
Infectious infections require more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. The part of the efforts to control the outbreak of the infectious disease is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic, known as the eruption of the epidemic.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help to cope with outbreak include personal prevention measures, such as hygiene of hands, the use of medical masks and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distances, such as closure of schools and the abolition of mass activities; community involvement in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning; and, once China has become serious, stronger actions have been taken to curb the outbreak, such as the isolation of whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a system for warning the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to infected persons who were self-inclusion and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks increased and fined the stockpiling of surplus medications, and modelling for Britain and the United States showed that there were serious problems with regard to mitigation (reducing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (restraining the epidemic).
The optimal policy of mitigating the effects of the disease could reduce the peak pressure on the health system by 2/3 and mortality by double, but could lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapsing of health systems.
It may be preferable, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed, if it occurs earlier), since otherwise the spread of the disease will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic lead to social and economic costs.
There are currently no anti-virusive drugs approved for COVID19 treatment but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Rechargeless medications, a sufficient amount of fluid, and recreation can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the gravity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, internal infiltration of liquid and support for breathing.
The use of steroid drugs can only harm.
Several connections previously approved for treatment of other virus diseases are also considered for treatment by COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic” tools could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health to the needs of patients from COVID19 as the main response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to facilitate the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for testing at COVID-19, the cancellation of urgent procedures where possible, the detection of virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis COVID19, as well as the enhancement of capacity for intensified therapy through training of staff and increased availability of IML and cocas.
There are various theories of where the first infection could arise — the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new cronavirus infection was likely to take place on 1 December 2019 in the city of Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the number of crown-virus infections in Hubei Province has gradually increased.
They were mainly related to the optical market of the Juanan sea products, where living animals were also sold, and one theory was that the virus had entered the body of one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zoonous origin. On 26 December, a mass pneumonia disease was registered in the Hubei Province clinic, with which doctor Zang Tianjin, reported on 27 December to the Centre for Control and Prevention of the Tsiankhan morbidity in the city of Uhang.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at the central clinic in the city of Ouhan warned their colleagues of “the Crown Virus Similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wennjan, were warned by the police that they were responsible for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Fen, received a conspiracy from her chiefs for raising panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Huhana issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The health authorities of Huhana reported on the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate investigations in early January, doubled the number of cases every seven and a half days at the early stages of the outbreak.
At the beginning and mid-January of 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, which were facilitated by Chinese New Year ' s holidays and the fact that Uhan was a transport and main railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenchen.
According to the later official data, by 20 January 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already occurred in 6,174 persons; as of 26 March, the United States had beaten China and Italy to the largest number of confirmed infections in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 were killed and more than 364,000 were cured.
Some 200 countries and territories recorded at least one reported case.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen Zone have restricted their freedom of movement and established border controls.
National responses included measures to curb the spread of disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory residence, compulsory shelter or isolation), as well as curfew hours. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in a form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure increased to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID19 was registered in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, whose reliability was unchecked, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, a doctor, Zhang Ziysian, was working with an unknown type of pneumonia, and on 27 December, her clinic notified the Centre for Control and Prevention of Tsianhang morbidity in the city of Uhan.
The first genetic test of the patients, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Huhanya issued a public notification.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Huhan to be responsible for the “dissemination of hearings” of the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission asserted that there was no “existent evidence” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transferred from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jingpin, as “the national war”.
The events of “the most large-scale quarantine in human history” began to occur, on 23 January the health border and the ban on entry into Uhaan and back, which later extended to a total of 15 towns in Hubei province and affected a total of some 57 million people.
Personal transport was prohibited in the city.
In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were cancelled.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Hospital in Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was constructed and accepted by other patients.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China has also reprofiled 14 other institutions in Huhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year.
Universitys and schools were closed throughout the country.
Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote work regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside the province of Hubei.
The public transport schedule has been modified and the museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a national control regime has been introduced, and it has been calculated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) have faced a form of open air traffic restrictions; since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city; as of 23 March, only one internal infection was reported in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, from the person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister of China, Lee Ketzan, reported that the incidence of internally transmitted diseases was largely stopped and the outbreak in China was monitored.
On the same day of travel restrictions in Hubeya except Uhania, this occurred two months after the closure of the province to quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that, since 28 March, the entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided companies with cash incentive packages. On 4 April, a three-minute national “minute silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the crownavirus declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the COVID-19 feast, but the central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the dead online in order to avoid the re-emergence of the COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji, met in Tegu.
The Shinchongji followers arrived in Tegu from Uhania, which is allegedly a source of outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported their symptoms. On 23 February, 2020, South Korea received the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were registered in Korea and, on 29 February, this figure has increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after three soldiers had tested the existence of a virus.
The flash has influenced the number of travels, so the schedule of airline flights has been changed, and South Korea has launched a population screening programme on the existence of a virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantines for contacts, which is considered the largest and better in terms of its organization worldwide.
The screening techniques included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through a mobile annex to all outsiders, a primary test for the virus, whose results were ready for the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea ' s programme was considered successful in the fight against outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities had not been isolated, and the South Korean society had initially split the response of President Mun Ji Yin to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the actions of the President or called on Mr. Moon to impress Mr. Muna for the inappropriate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest total infections per day were recorded in South Korea within four weeks.

On 19 February, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Kuma, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Health Education, two people died later on the same day.
The first measures introduced by the Government included the abolition of concerts and other cultural and sports events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five trillion rials to the fight against the virus.
President Hassan Ruhani stated on 26 February 2020 that the Government did not intend to punish entire areas affected by outbreak, but only individuals would be placed on quarantine.
In March, plans for restricting intercity travel were announced, but the intensive movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
The Shiite sanctuaries in Kuma remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020, Iran became the centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the background of the statement of concealment of the outbreak in Iran, more than 10 countries had linked cases with Iran by 28 February, indicating that the outbreak could be more serious than 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government on that date.
Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members were reported on 3 March that the test results for the virus were positive.
On 12 March, Human Wrights Vats (Human Detention of Human Rights) called upon the Iranian prison leadership to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful disposition and to release temporarily all prisoners appropriate to that category.
The Organization states that there is an increased risk of spreading the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths registered since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 active or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By 23 March, in Iran, 50 new cases of cronavirus were recorded every hour and every 10 minutes, one new death from the crownivus.
According to the representative of WHO, the rate of morbidity in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
U.S. sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capacity to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights requested the mitigation of economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease was in Italy when two Chinese tourists had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test in Rome.
The number of cases of contamination has increased rapidly, causing the Italian Government to halt all flights to China and China and to declare a state of emergency.
The unaccompanied COVID-19 disease cluster was subsequently found, and all started with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardia on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new spin-off control decree, according to which more than 50,000 of the 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were placed in quarantine.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry into the outbreak of the disease and the exit from it will be overlapped.
The Italian Government had already ordered the closure of all schools and universities throughout the country, since 100 people had already been killed in Italy at that time.
All major sports events, including the A series of football matches, were to be followed by closed doors before April, but on 9 March, all sports events were postponed for at least one month.
On 11 March, the Prime Minister of Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of enterprises except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reaction and Intensive Therapy (SIAARTI) issued recommendations on medical ethics with regard to protocols for the prioritization of medical treatment to patients, which may have to be used.
On 19 March, Italy obstructed China by the level of death from the crown-virus, taking its first place in the world, following the announcement of 3,405 deaths.
On 22 March it was known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection, 15,877 deaths and 21,815 cases of healing, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardia region.
In one CNN report, it is noted that such a high mortality rate in Italy can contribute to a combination of two factors — a large number of older citizens in that country and a lack of opportunity to investigate all those who are now suffering from crownivus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus as peacefully as possible from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the under-speed and serious response to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he recommended abstaining from all travel and social contacts that were not of paramount importance, offering people to work from home wherever possible and avoid public places such as pabs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pabs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month as a measure of support for the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent social distance measures, prohibiting more than two people from gathering and limiting travel and active recreation to fresh air only in cases of extreme necessity.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were imposed by the police, by the imposition of fines, and by the dispersal of accumulations.
Most businesses have been ordered to close except for enterprises that provide “life of the population”, including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, business stores, fuel stations and garage.

Despite this, the population testing in the United States was not immediately initiated, and the real extent of the outbreak of the disease was hidden during that period.
The examination was difficult due to the marriage of test sets issued by the Federal Government in February, the absence by the end of February of a federal government ' s permission to use non-State test kits that were developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria prior to March, which would allow citizens to be tested (this could only be done by appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by 27 February.
The Atlantic reported that less than 14,000 tests had been conducted by 13 March.

WHO noted the clear differences between the situation of a typical pneumonia that took place in 2002-2004, in which the Chinese authorities were accused of securing information, which allegedly prevented the prevention and control of the spread of the disease, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central Government “regularly provided updated information on the situation to avoid panic on the eve of the Chinese New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on transportation in Ouhan, the representative of WHO, Yoven Galea, noted that although “the measure was clearly not recommended by WHO”, it was also “a very important confirmation of the implementation of the obligation to contain the epidemic in the place of greatest proliferation” and referred to it as “unprecedented in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after the ability of the infection to transmit to the person outside China and the increase in the number of people living in other countries had been confirmed, WHO had declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation had become the sixth since 2009, when such a measure had been applied for the first time during the pandemic flu.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, said that the PHEIC announcement was “due to the global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries with unreliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that are unnecessary to impede international movements and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to countries that “do not have systems to identify people affected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is a degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest ranks” and called upon the international community to make a choice: invest today or to pay in the future”. The press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire United Nations system to respond to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic manner”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group that provided the work of international experts and field staff of WHO in China to assist in the resolution of the internal situation and the assessment of “severity and contagion”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of provincial and district responses, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “peace should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that it would be too early to call the disease a pandemic, but countries must be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak erupted in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global circulation of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Emergency Health Programme, warned in his statement: “This is the verification of every government on the planet to be prepared for a real situation: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready,” and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid “the worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not provide a basis for announcement of the global pandemic by public health officials, and added that the pandemic announcement would mean that “we are in fact acknowledging the fact that every human being in the world will be at risk of infected with the virus”.
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO was “deeply concerned at both the alarming high incidence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction due to the problem”. WHO is seriously criticized by the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the later declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
Mr. Tedros Adenama, Director-General of WHO, was given a petition to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to apply life-saving measures to it and that the Government had the responsibility to organize such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should to no extent justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone was entitled to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unsecured groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on responses to policy responses throughout the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The Digital Node provides information on policy measures by various countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health systems and the world economy, address the effects of carantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet of Michael Gov and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of the President of Brazil, Jaira Bolsonar, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for the quarantines they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have shown dissatisfaction with the response of the political exploding process in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China Si Jinpin from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Litzyang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the crown-virus had begun in Ouhan but took side to the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had arisen in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration Donald Trump called the Crown Virus of China or the “Virus of Huhanya”, stating that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “due to the inability of the U.S. president's administration to curb the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast had access to a U.S. government telegram, which contained a communication strategic craft, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with reference to the strategy: “The whole business is in China.
We are asked to distribute this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television presentations.” Such organizations as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China ' s efforts to assist virus-affected countries are part of the propaganda campaign to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Josep Borrell, warned of the presence of “the geopolitical component that includes the fight against influence through piar and the so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is steadily advocating the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information sent to the last two countries.
The donation by Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused of redirecting assistance to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy, were also controversial with regard to medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has deployed hundreds of IWL equipment for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “China only responded bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, after telephone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy, President Vladimir Putin of Russia arranged for Russian military sanitation, specialized disinfecting transport and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “unusable or not useful to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of trying to give a favourable impression to the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic level”.
President of Lombardia Atilio Fontan and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Spokesman for Creml Dmitry Peskov stated that “in proposing assistance to American colleagues [Putin] implied that, when American producers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they would also be able to respond as needed”.
The NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest military exercises of NATO since the end of the cold war — will be carried out in a short form.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hadson, criticized Defender 2020 (Protector 2020): “In the crisis that has arisen today in public health, these teachings endanger the lives of not only the military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries in which such activities are to be carried out.” The Government of Iran has suffered severely from the virus, and some two dozen members of Parliament, as well as fifteen other current or former political actors, have been infected.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani, in an open letter, requested the world ' s leaders to provide assistance, reporting that his country was in a difficult position to combat the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets for the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other well-being countries, including the introduction of a single system of health care and care for children, paid family leaves and increased public health financing.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative effect on the chances of Donald Trump to re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan's “uniform and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in designated places by the Government.
The South Korean society was initially divided by the reaction of President Mun Zhein to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the actions of the President or called on Mr. Moon to impress for the inadequate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease; the pandemic forced the countries to adopt emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban an indefinite right to administer by decrees, suspend the work of Parliament, as well as to hold elections and punish those accused of disseminating faycular information on the virus and government responses to the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was described as a result of several supply deficits due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Food and Medicine Quality Control has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment, resulting from increased demand and malfunctions in suppliers.
In several settlements there were also panic purchases; this resulted in the disappearance of essential goods from shops, such as food, toilet paper and beiled water, which in turn led to a deficit of stockpiles.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to Mr. Tedros Adenam, Director-General of WHO, the demand for individual protection has increased 100 times.
This jump resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of funds for individual protection worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would be attacked for that reason.
In Australia, in connection with the Daigo pandemic, buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This has led to a shortage of child nutrition in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID19 in Northern Italy and the Huhan region, as well as the high demand for food, food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and the illicit trade in critical products that have been successful have avoided the severe shortage of food expected in Europe and in North America.
North Italy, whose agricultural production is small, has not experienced significant downturn, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices can increase.
The shelves of food stores were left empty only temporarily, even in the city of Ouhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stocks to ensure full food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain food supplies in case of emergency.
China was affected by the damage caused by the world economy: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy suffered severe damage in the first two months of 2020, as a result of measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, which reduced its retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Material China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, viral outbreak is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agate Demarai, an Economist Intelligence Unit, predicted that market volatility would continue until a clearer understanding of potential results was made.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth might exceed the consequences of the 2002-2004 Atypical Pneumonia epidemic.
According to one of the estimates made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take urgent measures following a sharp decline in oil prices due to the decline in demand by China.
On 24 February, the world's stock markets collapsed as a result of a significant increase in the number of people infected by COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On 27 February, due to the growing fear of the outbreak of the coronavirus, the various U.S. stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Doo-Jones index for shares of industrial companies, have shown the most dramatic decline since 2008, with Dou falling by 1191 point, the largest one-day fall after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indexes showed a more than 10 per cent drop.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China ' s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative projection.
The shares again fell due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a risk of a recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the prohibitions on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist sites, and the recommendations of Governments not to take any trips.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines have cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for airlines, including British Airways, China East Airlines and Qantas, and Flybe's British Regional Airlines ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chung-June, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
A number of activities involving a large number of people, including annual New Year ' s festivals, have been abolished by national and regional Governments; private companies have also closed their own shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands.
Many new-year events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass accumulations; for example, in Beijing, the Forbidden City had been closed and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holidays until 10 February, instructing most enterprises not to open up until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and have declared an emergency by closing schools until March and cancelling the New Year ' s Retailing Branch, which has suffered globally: the store hours have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Retailing points in Europe and Latin America were reduced by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, the attendance of trade centres fell from 33 to 43 per cent in March compared with February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of visitor temperature checks and cancellations, and, according to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic could leave 14 to 22 million more people below the poverty line than would be in a similar situation but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of the Uhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers found themselves at home in their own provinces or were locked in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Luis, in the United States, a coronavirus spontaneous outbreak could deprive the workplace of 47 million people, while unemployment could reach 32 per cent; the measures imposed in India would leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who received daily wages unemployed; a study carried out by the Angus Reid Institute revealed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had suffered unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers had also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers filed applications for temporary unemployment allowance and 1 million British workers sought a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany had transferred their staff to a subsidized government reduced working schedule, part-time.
The German wage scheme for part-time work was also introduced in France and Britain.
Arts and cultural heritage were also severely affected by the pandemic that affected organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often-funded State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as, whenever possible, support the people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed throughout the world for an indefinite period, or access was differently limited and exhibits, events and presentations were cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, extensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and revolutionary impact of the spread of the virus — the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion displays.
The cinema also crashed, and the Vatican announced the abolition of the St. Morning Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Post.
Many eparchies recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services began to be broadcast on radio, on direct air, or on television, while some church leaders offer open air service.
Rome’s Roman Catholic episode closed to visit its churches, platoons and areas of St. Peter, where there are no more Christian pilgrims, and later other religious organizations have also abolished religious services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gumbre.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the crownvirus and the sanctuary was later closed; Saudi Arabia banned the access of foreign pilgrims and its own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has brought about the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since World War II.
Most of the major sports events were cancelled or transferred, including the League of the 2019-20 UEFA champions, the 2019-20 Premier League, EURO-2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the Crown Virus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Olympic Flying Games to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transferred for the period after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021”. Kazino and other gambling institutions all over the world were closed and the poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast in direct air, were either moved or cancelled.
This has led many players to move online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers.
Many large theatres, such as the Broadways, also canceled all their plays.
As an alternative to traditional offline businesses, some artists and musicians have studied options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing direct broadcasts of online conferences or web festivals; this helps people with creative professions to continue to perform, release or publish their works.
There was a lot of Internet memorial on the subject of the crownvirus, many of which are humorous and constrain the alarming moods of uncertainty.
Since COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against Chinese and East Asian citizens, as well as to the hotlines of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
In February (when most cases were still limited to China) racist attitudes were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or had received fair retaliation for anything.
In some African countries, there is also an increase in anti-China attitudes.
Many residents of Hubei and Hubeya reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China ' s citizens, as well as those living in affected areas, were supported both in offline and online.
The epidemic began to be spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to face the serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions could also begin to be influenced by suspiciousness and xenophobia; citizens of such countries as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had signed a petition early in order to prohibit China ' s citizens from entering their countries with a view to curbing the epidemic.
In Japan, Hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan (#China Don't Come to Japan) held leading positions in Twitter.
China ' s citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
The U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for what he called the Crown Virus the Chinese virus; critics regard this view as racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses transporting Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Uhanya to New Sanjara.
Students coming from China's north-eastern India border and trained in major towns in India reported cases of persecution related to the outbreak of the crownivus.
Dilip Hhosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharatia Janata Party, Western Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and had “they had been revengeed by God”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them “a misguidance”. In China, xenophobia and racism were once again erupted against non-China citizens: foreigners were called “foreign debris” and“utilization” objects.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have eliminated such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the crownvirus.
Many scientific publishers have made open access to their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies on the Preprites ' Publication Servers, such as bioRxiv.

The smuggling of wild animals and animal diseases is a health risk associated with the trafficking of exotic animals.
Laboratory testing of the respiratory crown-virus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods detecting the presence of the virus and the detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by the PPP, which recognizes the RNA of cronaurus.
This test is specific and only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) may be used for both diagnosis and population control.
Antibodies have detected the number of people who have endured the disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat them in the hospital or were not available at all.
The exact level of death and collective immunity of the disease can be determined by such a test.
As of March 2020, because of the limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was very controversial.
Such discrepancies are likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
With a polymericial chain reaction, a real-time reverse transcribing (rRT-PCR) test can be carried out on respiratory sampling samples obtained in various ways, including a rhino-wheeled cord or a sample of wet.
The results are usually available for a period of between hours and two days.
The CPD test carried out on strokes taken from the throat is only valid during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but it can continue to reproduce in the lungs.
Infected patients tested for the second week of the disease may be alternativeed to taking materials from lower respiratory pathways through a draining cateter, or to use products of recharge (mocrat).
One of the early PCB tests was developed in the Charite Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerial chain reaction with reverse transcrimination in real time (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 packages that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, Kogenebiotech developed a set for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the Clinical Level of PowerChek Coronavirus.
It identifies the “E” gene, common to all beta-coron viruses, and the RdRp gene, special to SARS-CoV-2. The China BGI Group has become one of the first companies that have obtained the authorization of China ' s National Drug Administration to use the SARS-CoV-2 toolkit expeditiously, based on the CCD. In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their diagnostic pane to the International Reagent Resource in public health laboratories (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.
One of the three genetic tests in the older versions of the test sets produced incomplete results due to the married reactors and the narrow CDC testing area in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed during February 2020.
Two component tests were not considered to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Medicine Quality Supervisory Office in the context of the emergency use permit, and the U.S. commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 on the basis of RT-CPD throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started a COVID-19 test throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations were stated; the fence and processing of analyses should be met in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology, ECTR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service, reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics had received the approval of FDA for a test that could take 3.5 hours on a large scale, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency permit to the Abbott laboratories for the Abbott m2000 tests; FDA previously issued a similar resolution to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, the Cepheid also receives the EUA from FDA for a 45-minute test.
FDA also approved a test using insulated nucleic acids instead of PCBs.
Since this test does not require a series of overlapping temperature cycles, it can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
At present, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concludes that “the right of the chest cell has a small diagnostic value at early stages, whereas the results of the CT [computer volume] may have such value even before the symptoms occur.”
The typical features identified in the TC include bilateral sub-plural focuses of mathematical glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteriore distribution.
Sub-pleural dominance, the symptom of the boulder bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study that compared the PCB and CTC methods used in Huhan at the time of the current pandemic has shown that the CTC is much more sensitive than the CCD, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first line testing method in COVID-19”. As of March 2020, CDC initial screening recommends the use of the CCD method.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in people after the 7th day of the presence of symptoms, to determine immunity and to control populations. The analysis may be carried out in central laboratories (CLT) or by detection on the ground (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to perform high-productive automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of each such system.
CLT typically uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may be used to track immune responses.
With a PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained by a roll of every cover.
Unlike the PCD methods, the blood-blooding phase is not required for a sample analysis. On 26 March 2020, FDA named 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their tests to antibodies.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one emergency application permit test. Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European permits to use their test sets, which could detect antibodies IgG and IgA in blood samples capable of combating the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples over a few hours and therefore is much faster than the normal PCB-analysis of the RNA virus.
Antitela is usually detected 14 days after infection, and in early April, Britain found that no antibodies it acquired are satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: “Specific patients are given a sample to the patient, the patient is spitting in it, giving back and after a while receives the results of the test.” British NHS announced the launching of its pilot test scheme for suspicious cases in the home environment that reduces the risk of infection by other visitors to the clinic, or the need to disinfect the patient ' s ambulance if used for the patient ' s carriage.
The Centres for Express Tests have helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and broadest testing procedures in any country. On 2 March, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany stated that it was ready to conduct some 12,000 tests per day in outpatient conditions and only 10,700 tests a week earlier.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to President Robert Koch of the Institute, Germany's overall test productivity is 160,000 tests a week.
As of 19 March, a number of major cities were proposed for express tests.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests passed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of 483,295 analyses had been taken on SARS-CoV-2, up to week 12/2020, including 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent) and that the researchers of the Israeli clinic Technion and Rambam Hospital had developed and tested the simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and further analyses only if the combined specimen showed a positive result. On 5 February 2020, BGI was opened by the Temporary Laboratory of the area of 2,000 square metres for the detection of emergency cases, called Khuo-Junh (by Chinese or fired eye), which could produce more than 10,000 samples per day.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Jiam and completed in just five days; modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been operational at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would be 47 per cent higher, and therefore the cost of quarantine would also be twice as high.
At the opening of the lab in Huo-Jang, Xenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 Chinese towns were immediately opened in Uhan.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity was 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplier schemes of Origami Assays were released, which could test up to 1,122 COVID19 patients with only 93 samples, and such balanced designs could work in small laboratories, excluding the use of robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, owing to lack of reagents and insufficient numbers, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States has become problematic.
As a result, some authors referred to the test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of corovirus testing, which is currently carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita, was higher than that of any other country and would soon be protested by a large part of the population.
This was due to the capacity of the Group of 42 and BGI to obtain a mass testing laboratory (constructed on the basis of their Huo-Jang emergency laboratories in China).
This lab, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-CPD tests a day and is the world ' s first laboratory of such a large scale outside China.
Various tests aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by United States epidemiological hygienic centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in the absence of test kits in the United States; at the outbreak of China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of test kits, and those countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient quantities recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts argue that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Over a few years, the South Korean Government has worked to provide testing opportunities, mostly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as a best way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples, were overloaded and stockpiles for mascoving and chemical reactors were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American CDC test kits were “inadequacy”, and for that reason the Government removed the bureaucratic barriers that hindered the private development of tests, and Spain had acquired test sets from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.
The Firm explained that the inaccurate results could be the failure to collect samples or the misuse of sets.
The Ministry of Spain stated that it would recognise inaccurate data sets and replace them with other sets, Shenzhen Bioeayy. 80 per cent of the test sets that Czech Republic had acquired in China were incorrect. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also found inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be dropped to Danube, and Atesch Kara, a Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test sets acquired in China had “a high level of errors” and the Ministry had “non-used them”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was declared that these sets were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses had a positive impact on SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of the people who had been contacted by such patients, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Wo, where a person died from COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two test cycles of the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed in quarantine.
The entrance to the human settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic leaked far less tensely than in other developed countries and did not have to impose such extreme restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay at home, but schools with holidays ended on 23 March opened by schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic because of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but restrictions have been less aggressive.
Statistics have shown that in countries where more tests have been conducted compared to death rates, mortality rates are likely to be much lower because more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms have been detected.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID19, send their first five positive and the first ten negative results to COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for supporting testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the next graph, the “positive results” column is dependent on the country-specific testing policy.
The country where hospitalized patients are only tested will have a higher score than the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
The washing of hands, also known as “hygiene of hands”, is the process of purifying hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal oral way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, such as if he touches his eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. lippery shells) with his unwitting hands.
Five critical moments during the day followed by the washing of hands with soap: before and after defecation, after the bruising of the child or the replacement of the cubs, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing the raw meat, fish and domestic bird.
If water and soap are inaccessible, the hands can be cleaned with the help of the sculpture. The World Health Organization recommends that the hands be washed:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the care of a sick person.
After the change of pancakes or the blow-up of the child who went to the toilet.
After the shrink, the cough or the sneeze.
After touching animals, food or waste of animal origin.
The medical health of the hands is related to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medication or medical procedures would prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical objective of hand was to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the health sector, but it is also important for all others.
Hand washing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and reduces the infant mortality rate in households.
A 2013 study showed that a better washing of hands could lead to a small increase in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of diarrhea cases by about one third, comparable to the benefits of low-income clean water regions.
The reduction in the number of diarrhoea cases by 48 per cent may be due to washing hands with soap, and washing hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ODS), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each house, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the main cause of under-five mortality, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before food and after a toilet that has become a solid habit can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost twice and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
The small negative effect of often washing hands is that it can result in skin drying and, in consequence, in damage.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that too frequent hand washing can lead to a zood and skin decay — a disease known as extremity or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health workers.
Too often, hand washing can also be considered a symptom of obsessive and compulsive disorder (RBM).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day that washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of facal-oral transmission of the disease: after bleaching (carboning, defecation), after pruning the baby's birch (smelling), before feeding the child, before eating, and before/after cooking, or processing cheese meat, fish or bird.
Some other cases where hands should be washed in order to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of cuts or wounds, after chewing, coughing or shrinking, after the waste of animal origin or of animals, after the garbage has been touched.
In many countries, the washing of hands with soap is quite limited.
A study of hand washing conducted in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of the families with soap was a common practice; the 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the middle, 77 per cent; the lowest was recorded in China, 23 per cent; there were several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.
The Emergency Health Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of a wide range of activities to improve child health and education.
This national programme is based on dehelmintization, which is conducted twice a year, as well as on daily washing of hands with soap and daily cleaning of fluorescent teeth.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from every cover is more effective if soap or washing is added in the process.
The main operation of soap and cleaning tools is to remove barriers to solventity and improve its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of purifying the skin, since fats and proteins, which are organic contamination components, are poorly dissolved in the water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
Solid soap can also contain bacteria that can be hit by its previous use because of its reusable use.
A small number of studies on abnormal bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap show a small probability of such falling, as bacteria are washed off the foam.
CCW still claims that “a liquid soap with a hand dosage is the preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care for their health.
To date, there is no evidence of the fact that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfecting tools has an electoral impact on organisms that are resilient to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains prevalent antibacterial agents, such as triklosane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be advertising.
In addition to the surface-active substance and means of protecting the skin, complex compounds may contain acids (axusal, assorbinal, dairy) as a regulator of the RN, as well as antimicrobial active benzoid acid and other contaminants (loyal faith, vitamins, methols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the Oregon Public Health School of the University of Oregon showed that the prevention and removal of bacteria from the skin of the hands, the simple varieties of soap are as effective as the usual anti-bacterial soap containing triclose.
Hot water is still not hot enough for the human skin to kill bacteria.
The bacteria are multiplied much faster at 37 °C.
However, warm soap water is more effective to remove natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria than cold.
Contrary to the popular view, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
Hand - hygiene hygiene for hands (sanitaiser) or hand septics is a hygienic tool that does not contain water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene (also known as hand-disinfectives, anti-septics for hand-disinfections or sunits) became popular.
Most of these means are made on the basis of isopropyl or ethanol, which adds nutrients such as carbonmer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of helm, or wetlands such as liquid or song glycerin, which provide convenience for the use of these tools and reduce the effects of alcohol drying.
The addition of a diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the anti-microbial activity, and dezinating substances containing a minimum of 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Bacteria, including multiple medicinal resistance bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and mushrooms, are killed by desynic drugs.
The disinfecting funds containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a reduction logarithm of 3.5 equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) on hand 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (a 4-5 reduction logarithm) in hands, one minute after the use. Hand dezynic means are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most frequent cause of the communicable gastroenterite. A sufficient number of antiseptics or alcohol-containing equipment must be used to scrutinize and soak the skin on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both hands, as well as the space between fingers throughout the length, shall grow for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are fully absorbed.
The ends of the fingers on both hands should also be carefully washed, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that the hand washing rather than the use of disinfectives, especially if the hands were severely contaminated.
The growing popularity of such disinfecting means is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap were available.
Often the use of hand-and-potential dysynthesis can cause dryness of the skin if its composition does not contain aggravating means and (or) leather wetlanders.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other mitigating substances to the instrument.
During clinical tests, hand-disinfecting devices containing softening components caused much less irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact leakage syndrome or hypervisability to alcohol or supplements present in disinfecting equipment are virtually unrealized.
The lower likelihood of an irritating contact deprivation has become a factor in the choice of disinfecting funds compared to soap and water.
Despite their efficiency, water-free means do not purge the hands of organic substances but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand-disinfecting tools are not so effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as usual soap and water, since pathogenic microorganisms are still on hand in such means.
The effectiveness of the disinfecting instrument for the hands that do not contain alcohol depends largely on the components and composition, and has historically been much lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing funds.
Most recently it was proven that the drugs used by the benzalconia chloride are persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be losing efficiency after multiple use, probably due to progressive side-to-one reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if the clay or the clay is contaminated by microorganisms, it can increase the spread of the disease.
As well as soap, the ceiling is a disinfecting tool, as in contact with the water, there is a clear solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of cereal or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing techniques that include the following stages:
Put your hands in warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that the waters be water flowing because the waters standing can be contaminated and that the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wear your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, as well as areas between your fingers and your fingers.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows that with soap (and not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Three hands for at least 20 seconds.
Tracing helps remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you треin your hands, the more microbes are removed.
Carefully bleach your hands under protein water.
Hand overlapping in standing water can cause reinfecting.
Hold your hands with a clean towel or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more easily contaminated, and most people are neglected by areas such as thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and fingers.
The artificial nails and the glazing nouvelles can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a welding lotion to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands, which can cause damage to the skin and increase the risk of infection.
If wet and wet are not available, there are many inexpensive ways to wash hands: pouring water out of a whirlwind or a bottleneck with the openings and (or) using the ceiling if necessary, such as in developing countries; there are water-saving solutions in limited water (e.g., schools or rural areas in developing countries), such as knife pedal and other low-cost options.
A krane with a foot pedal is a simple design consisting of a receptacle hanged on the rope and a knife lever that should be pressed so that the water can be poured into its hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand pitch is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are being held about the most effective form of drying in public toilet.
Increasing research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hands dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Salfets and Flots, which was the subject of a comparison of the hygienicity of paper-fellows, the drying of hands with warm air and the more modern stream-driven hands dryers.
It was found that, after washing and drying hands in warm air, the total number of bacteria on fingers' pillows increased by an average of 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the hands.
It has also been found that the total number of bacteria on fingers' pillows increases by 42% after washing and drying hands in a dryer with airflow.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on fingers' pillows decreases on average to 76 per cent, while in the hands, to 77 per cent.
The air dryer, which releases air with declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 miles/h), is able to drain microorganisms from the hands and from its own block and potentially contaminate other users of the toilet room and sangulla in the radius to 2 metres.
The use of dried hands with warm air extends microorganisms in the radius to 0.25 metres from drying.
In 2005, Tüv Produkt und Umwelt carried out a study on the assessment of different methods of the drying of hands.
The following changes in the number of bacteria depending on the hand drying method are observed:
There are many different hand dryer producers, and hand dryers are compared to the drying of paper canvas.
Hand-cleaning with disinfecting salfets can be an alternative solution during travels in the absence of soap and water.
The hand-drinking hand-drinking tool shall contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of hand was mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Zemmelways found it highly effective (in 1846) in the prevention of stationary diseases.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of these devices really helps to reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of the hands lasts at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of soap, water, or helmet used for washing and stripping each part of the hands.
Hands should be carefully teared against each other by folding their fingers.
If there's mud under the fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with a clean towel.
The paper towel should be used after the drying of the hands, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This prevents repolluctation of hands from these surfaces.
The goal of washing hands in health facilities is to remove pathogens (Microb) and prevent their spread.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
According to one study, the correct washing of hands and other basic procedures could reduce the level of catheter-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a leaflet with a standard procedure for washing and handling of hands to be applied in the health sector.
The draft manual of WHO on hand health is also available on its website and open for public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in a co-authority.
If validation of the normative requirements is required, commercial devices can be used to measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization denotes “five points” when the hands are needed:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
before the use of anti-Septic as well as
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing (Medicine or antimicrobial soap) helps destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary before performing surgical operations or in an environment of high organisms that are resistant to antibiotics. The “cleaning” of the hands before the surgery requires a crane that can be switched on and off without its hands; a little chlorogexidine or iodine water should also be used to heal hands, sterile towels for the drying of the hands after washing, sterile tube for friction and other sterile cleaning tool.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of hands and elbows normally within 2 to 6 minutes.
You don't have to wipe your hands too long, like 10 minutes.
During the strip, the water from the forearm should not go back to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with sterile tissues and wearing surgical salt.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash hands or use antiseptic for the hands before and after care.
In the hospitals, the first 20 per cent of washing was found to be the most advantage of washing hands, and very few additional advantages were gained when the frequency of hand was increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with the washing of anti-bacterial soap, the usual washing of hands leads to more than threefold increases in the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food, compared with the anti-bacterial soap anti-bacterial soap anti-bacterial washing in the hands, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that the processing of the hands of the spirating solution reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared with the antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for hands, to reduce the number of flu virus in the hands of A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficile dispute, which may include training of staff in hand washing, increasing accessibility of alcohol-containing solutions, and written and oral reminders to the staff on the need to wash hands.
Additional studies are needed on the most effective measures in various health facilities.
In developing countries, washing of hands with soap has been recognized as an economically effective and important tool for improving health and even digesting.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand washing at home, at schools and in the workplace makes it difficult to learn to wash hands regularly.
For example, in most rural Africa, there are far from every private toilet or public toilet, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene may also be caused by rooted habits rather than by lack of soap or water.
Promoting and stimulating hand washing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in population behaviour.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results must be carried out.
The systemic analysis of 70 studies found that, in order to improve the hygiene situation of hands in income-generating countries below the average level, hygienic and epidemic surveillance at the community level was less effective, while public marketing campaigns were less effective; one example of the promotion of hand washing in schools was the approach of the United Nations Children ' s Fund, Three Star Approach, which promoted the implementation in schools of simple economic measures that encouraged students to wash their hands with soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
Installation of hand-wholemen is one of the possible measures being taken in hand-health campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The World Washing Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (secured years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitation measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health, especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the area of hand health: Ignaz Simmelweis, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse, and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten odors called myasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of health-related diseases and health-related infections, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have become more proactive in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of the pig influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters were scattered in public toilet and in office buildings and airports with “managed hand washing techniques. ”
The phrase “muffle hands” means the reluctance to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; then this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play, Lady McBet begins to wash her hands in an attempt to clear the imaginary spot of unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed herself and encouraged her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed an unethical act tended to wash their hands more frequently than others, and their hands were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions the washing of hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning: the symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual of many religions, including Baha, Hinduism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam, and religions also prescribe hygienic washing of their hands, especially after certain actions.
Induism, Judaism and Islam require mandatory washing of hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors related to COVID-19
Control of production factors related to COVID-19 implies the application of labour safety and health techniques to control risk and combat the 2019 coronarius (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control depends on the place and work task, based on risk assessment, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office of Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues and, in such cases, basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encourage workers to stay at home in signs of disease, respect for respiratory ethics, and conduct daily cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID19 but are likely to be infected as a result of the current spread of disease in society or during international visits.
This may include workers who contact the public, such as schools, high-density work environments and some large retail shops.
Risk controls for such a group, in addition to basic preventive measures, include high-efficiency air filters, protective screens and affordable personal protection in case of contact with a person infected by COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and morgue personnel who have been contacted with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 are at high risk; the risk increases to very high in the aerosol procedures of such staff, or the collection/processing of human samples with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk controls suitable for such staff include the use of security engineering equipment, such as negative ventilation rooms and personal protection tools suitable for the task.
The COVID-19 flash may have different effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be available in the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may vary in terms of both the types of goods for which there is demand and how to acquire such goods (e.g. purchases in non-management periods with delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there may be a disruption to the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The Plan for the Preparedness and Responses can be used in the organization of protection.
Plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, risk factors arising from houses and communities, as well as the risks of individual workers, such as age or chronic illness.
Plans also provide controls necessary to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparedness for the epidemic and responses may be subject to recommendations at the national or state level.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Responding to the degree of seriousness of diseases in the business community.
Risk control hierarchy is a structure that is widely used in labour safety and hygiene to group such funds depending on efficiency.
In the event that the risk of COVID-19 is not addressed, the most efficient safety and engineering equipment, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Engineering and safety equipment implies the exclusion of staff from jobs at risk and does not rely on the behaviour of the employee, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures include changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from the employee or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some risks.
All types of personal protection shall be selected according to the threat to the employee, fit in size (e.g. respirators), used continuously and properly, regularly checked, properly maintained and replaced as required, and correctly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and thorough washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory ethics, including shutting off their mouth with coughing and shaking, providing salphettes and containers for garbage, willingness to work away or change, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and daily cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially contaminated persons is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for the Control and Prevention of Disease (CDC) recommend that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain at home until the heat ends, the absence of an increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of gyroposing drugs or other medications that address symptoms, and that police officers be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member and to ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, high-risk posts require frequent and close contacts at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who do not have confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in connection with the spread of disease in society in the business territory or the recent visits of such a person to the COVID-19 location.
These categories include workers who have contact with the public, such as schools, a high population density working environment and some major retail shops, engineering and safety equipment for such groups and groups with higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, installation of physical barriers, such as transparent plastic protective screens, and mounting of non-critical client services without exit. Administrative measures for such groups and groups of higher risk include recommendations to patients to stay at home, replacement of personal meetings on virtual communications, setting of replacement schedules, stopping non-critical visits to the proliferation of COVID-19 or to develop communication plans in emergency situations, including a forum for responding to disturbing workers, providing relevant training for workers on risk factors of COVID-19 and measures of protection, training workers who need to use protective clothing and equipment, providing resources and working environments, including the provision of safety equipment, safety equipment, equipment and safety equipment.
In rare cases, respirators may be required for employees of this group of risks.
If a person is ill in a plane, appropriate safety for employees and other passengers is required such measures as isolation of a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, designation of a crew member to care for a sick person, provision of a sick mask or requesting a person to cover the nose and mouth of a salphet at coughing or shaking.
Secondary members of the crew shall carry one-time medical gloves when approaching a patient traveller, or when dealing with physiological liquids or potentially contaminated surfaces and perhaps additional personal protection if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves used and other one-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In commercial shipping cases, including cruise lines and other passenger vessels, the safety measures include the delay of travel in the event of sickness, self-inclusion and the immediate information of a medical centre on the ship, if any has heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, medical examinations should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare institutions, CDC recommends that short-term closure be conducted for cleaning or disinfecting if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
Where there is a minimum or medium rate of infection in the community, social distance strategies can be introduced, such as the cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical or choiring, cafeteria meals, increased distance between parties, the management of arrival and care time, the limitation of non-existent visits, the use of a separate location of health care facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
At a significant rate of dissemination in the local community, apart from social distance strategies, measures for long-term non-school activity may be considered; for law enforcement officials performing daily responsibilities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officials obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of infection of COVID19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions that are required by ambulance facilitators, including the use of appropriate personal protection tools.
When closely contacted during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their formable belts and embezzlement before reuse by domestic cleaning aerosols or by anti-trafficking, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and to dispose of used personal protection equipment, as well as to use and wash clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include health care, support, laboratories and medical transport staff contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19 infections.
They have a very high risk of infection in their aerosol procedures, or in the collection/ processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol include sensing, coughing, bronchoscopic procedures, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling by invasive methods.
Morgan workers with high risk include those handling people with confirmed disease or suspicion of infection of COVID19 at the time of their death; if such personnel carry out autopsy, they are placed in a very high-risk category. Additional security equipment for such groups include the use of isolated rooms for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID19, including in the conduct of aerosol education procedures.
In some health and morgue institutions, the use of a special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Tests should be followed by the precautionary measures for biological safety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be distributed to the diverse waiting zones, depending on the suspicion of contamination of COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection tools, OSHA recommends that respirators be used for workers working at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of infection by SARS-CV-2, as well as for those conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In the United States, the NIOSH respirators approved for a person with a N95 filter or a higher grade must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection programme that sets out the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort to the staff member. WHO does not recommend special treatment, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological liquids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the point of patient reception.
Individuals collecting samples from respiratory paths from COVID-19 or transceivers without aerosol procedures, WHO recommends wearing surgical masks, shields or protective screens for the person, snail and gloves.
In procedures accompanied by aerosol, the respirator N95 or FFP2 should be used instead of the surgical mask.
Given the inadequacy of individual protection tools worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such protection be minimized through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, access to patients infected by COVID19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only the means of personal protection required for a specific task, the continued use of the same respirator, without taking off, with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection and the recommendation not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparations for the future
DATE/REM OF AMENDMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DEVELOPMENTS: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interrelationships of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have not had precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen the communal and caring relationship between all our colleagues, as reflected in the electronic correspondence, calls and chats, a remarkable proof of the fact that, fortunately, we have been working with amazing people.
I'm very grateful and proud to talk about you as a colleague.
Last week, I was told that we appreciated our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
It is possible to do so through your work, whether to make websites work, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of communities.
The world needs the information provided in Wikipedia, and it's even more important today than ever before.
At a time to achieve meaningful results for peace, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together from the coming week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and schedules
As earlier said by Robin, the c-team team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During our communication, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to relieve our tensions and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let it happen.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff staff:
On our expectations, we will have to work around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the receipt of the orders.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purpose of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, whether you care for your family, acquire food, or go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority number one.
We're not watching your working time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
That is understandable and unquestionably, but we mention it.
There is no need for a hospital sheet or a time off: just inform your manager and help the team review the calendar and timetable to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID19 diagnosis, please report to Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The full payment of the hourly rates will be made.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to respect our contractors and staff with an hourly rate of payment.
Each person will be paid under normal hourly rates in normal circumstances.
This includes periods of sickness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in such times.
Again, it's self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we know what to expect, and we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
SPRE, HR Ops, TrustSafety and Fundraising (also) are performing critical work, for which additional support may be required.
We are initiating the process for all units to assess current objectives and focus on support, which is essential for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Deceleration today does not mean the negative consequences in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to get lost” after the pandemic ends.
You will not have to work overtime to meet unreal time frames for the current period.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and time frames, if possible.
What's going on with APP (annual plans)?
To adjust to the new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose extending the deadline for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for loved ones, while all who need or want to work will be given a reduced timetable for the next few weeks.
This extension of time limits significantly reduces the current workload of planning and tension throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the following steps immediately after receiving the relevant confirmation.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with COVID-19.
But in addition to a lot of precautionary measures, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus solutions at the medical level to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator lounges through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules requiring caution using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the district of Colombia (DC) is on the Web Company WeWork, which shared with us and all DC personnel its rules relating to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the Colombian district moved completely to remote work according to instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York are aware, we also discussed the lease of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues, who work away, know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one to two hours.
If there is a need for longer sessions, consider breaking them into a course of several days.
Identify the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and the information available in advance.
By default, use video links to facilitate communication and communication, and use tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
To be convenient, designate a focal point, a person who will monitor the entry of questions in the Chat and monitor the list of speakers as well as the one responsible for holding notes (or joint observation).
If necessary, please contact the E-mail Technical Support Service.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program for the purchase of lunches.
Connect to the #remots channel at Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring the ergonomics manuals available in web-based format to facilitate the efficiency of the distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community to cancel the massive activities financed by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such abolition and other restrictions may impede the inability of concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes in such objectives.
We will follow up on the week ahead with further guidance on Wikimania, as well as on other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
General sentiments in the global community are not only a disappointment in the interruption of work, but also a sense of reliance on understanding and the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to prospects, the CRT works on the Meta-Wiki page, which provides space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in contact with COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar to a special staff meeting to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time, we will take the opportunity to share further relevant information, to answer your questions, and to spend time together with each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help all that we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such electronic correspondence and other important information on COVID-19 from the Office of Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all the information will be collected in one location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
Where travel issues, events, key working flows, illumination problems or other assistance are available, contact the CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and liaison as necessary.
If confidentiality problems arise, please contact Brian Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations, by e-mail.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to provide the opportunity to continue to work, in order to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary services.
Our planned work will wait until the relevant time.
It is now time to support each other and to create a space for important work to come in future weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families and to work with the maximum of your contribution as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the remaining members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the relevant angiotensin-reflecting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it promising to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the point of entering cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a cinking metalferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-end peptide domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a single-propelled membrane protein type I, and its fermentative domain falls on the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The intercellular domain ACE2 is pumped off by another enzyme known as a masterpiece, and the solved protein is released into the bleeding and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the alveolar cells of type II lungs, the enterocytes of thin intestines, arterial and venosive endothelial cells and cells of the smooth muscles of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 is also detected in the brain cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE contrast.
ACE splits angiotensin I hormone into receptacular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, opens and hydrolyzes the carboximate end of amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) into a vasodilateral angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also break a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - Bradicin, appellate, neurotensin, dinormine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of neutral SLC6A19 amino acids and is present in Hartnup disease.
As a transmemembered protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus constituting COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, linking S1 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to an ACE2 enzyme on the surface of the cells leads to endocytosis and transfusions of both the virus and the enzyme in the cells.
The entry process also requires a S serin protasis protesa of TMPRSS2, which is currently being examined as a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to the idea that a reduction in ACE2 levels in cells can help to combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that inhibitors of APF and BRA continue the standard therapy.
According to the systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was due to a significant 34 per cent reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “Pneumonia has also been reduced by patients who have received APF inhibitors who are at higher risk, who have pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of deaths from pneumonia, although the results were less robust than those with a general pneumonia risk.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be new in therapy for acute pneumonic damage and is likely to improve the pulmonary hymdynamics and oxygen saturation of y powdered with acute respiratory deficiency syndrome caused by lypopolasarides.
The rhACE2 semi-emission period is about 10 hours, and the start is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some data show that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with classic inhibitors of renin angiotensing system (RAS) or in diseases in which a circular angiotensin II has been increased. The RhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical tests for acute respiratory distributor syndrome.
Annexes COVID-19 are mobile phone applications designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons (contacts) that could contact the infected person.
In some regions, many of the annexes formally supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options have been developed to monitor contacts.
This led to a discussion on issues of confidentiality, particularly with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of applications users.
More soft in this respect options include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate the support of such applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has launched an annex that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities and is used in Singapore by a TraceTogether annex.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be controlled by the Government. North Macedonia launched the StopKorona! Annex, which works on Bluetooth to help monitor contacts with potentially infected persons and to ensure rapid communication with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the annex was expected to register at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, and similar annexes are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering using applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether annex and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozone function to ensure that patients with COVID19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise from applications, including false responses and potential inefficiencies if the application is used only by a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the dissemination of misleading or harmful “coron-viruse” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could offer their crown-virus annexes to App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through the coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure established to combat the crownavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations have declared eight conditions for their public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the dissemination of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of aggravation of discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to deal with the problem of permanent observation, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it disappears.
In some countries, a web tracking of locations is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to load the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to reference data on the location also have major potential problems of confidentiality.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use the annexes as a basis was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including tracking data for mobile and card transactions, and then combined them to provide notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to prevent citizens from contacting the infected, but has also made the location available to the public, owing to significant changes in the law on protection of information that has been made since the MERS outbreak in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, consider using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As of 6 April 2020, details were not yet made public.
The tracking of contacts with confidentiality is a solid concept, with a significant amount of research literature dated at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups worked on decisions that ensure confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized crossings with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identification of the personal data never leaves the device and that all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that maintains confidentiality in collecting and using location data or crossing paths to track COVID-19 distribution.
The work of the platform is based on studies in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” document, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing technology for confidentiality, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies to enable users to share confidential data on locations and health with other users and officials without jeopardizing the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the teams sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were founded by a global TCN coalition aimed at reducing the fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of applications for tracing and warning, which is a key factor in their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the work of mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced an initiative to track contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of the technology of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography that allows for confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the work of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system has to be deployed in three stages:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of citizens infected by the crown-virus, but with confidentiality of data
Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple are planning to solve the problems of continuous surveillance, first putting the system into operation by renewing the operating system and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappeared.
Responding the drug (also known as reprofiling, redirecting, changing tasks or therapeutic transfer of drugs) is a reprofiling of the approved medicine for the treatment of a disease or medical condition other than that originally prescribed in the development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used for the development of safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other studies include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconnaissance plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are exposed to medication, each of which has several ligand linking sites.
The analysis of these linking sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protaza, RNA-dependent RNA-polimeraza, helicas, S proteins and ADF-ribosphataza.
Hussein AA and coauthors, in their Doclinic study, examined several of the candidate compounds that were then optimized and analysed their similarity to the most approved drugs in order to expedite the development of a high-efficiency drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorohin is an anti-malarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some automy-immune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychlorochine would be among the four medications examined under the “Solidarity” clinical test.
Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine tests would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA permitted the use of hydroxychlorochine sulphate and chlorochine phosphate in accordance with an emergency permit for use (EUA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical test process and is permitted in accordance with EUA only as a pilot treatment for patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment on clinical test schemes.
CDC stated that “the procedure for the use, dosage or duration of the use of hydroxychlorochine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use a drug when there's no way out.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorochine in conjunction with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are conducted at the University of Duke and Oxford.
The New York University Medical School in Langon examines the safety and effectiveness of the preventive use of hydroxychlorochine.
China's clinical tests in Huhan and Shenchhen have shown that the favipiriver is “simplely effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenchen, who received the drug, received a negative result in an average of four days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug were 11 days old.
A study was carried out in Huhan, where 240 pneumonia patients were monitored, one half of whom received a favir and the other half was a Umiphenovier.
The Italian pharmaceutical authorities reminded the public that the results of the drug ' s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that a drug would be purchased in Japan to replenish its stocks and that it would be delivered to university hospitals, where a drug would be used to treat patients from COVID-19, would be used by military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post, Cinzo Abe reported to the Trump Administration that the purchase of a drug could be less effective in cases of illness.
It may be unsafe for pregnant patients or for patients trying to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-virus drugs “Lopinvier” and “Ritovire” (Caletra) concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been identified”.
Preparates have been developed to inhibit HIV-reflecting by linking to protazz.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado seeks to modify medicines to find a connection that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protracted. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of medicines that have been specifically designed for therapy of HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included a combination of lazyvira and ritonevira in the international solidarity test.
The Remdesivir was established and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections, followed by the discovery by Gilead Sciences that the remdesiver has anti-virusive activity in the vitro with regard to many philo-, pneumos, paramixo and coronaviruses.
One of the problems related to anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies show that the remdesivir can have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinics are currently being tested, including two Cleveland university clinics; one is carried out on moderate patients and the other on patients with a more severe form.
Three clinical tests are currently under way for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, antibiotomicine testing began in New York State.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to undertake a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclesonide) Tejin, an inhalation corticosteroid for asthma treatment, to be used in the treatment of pre-simptom patients infected by the new crownerus.
Phase II, form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, has been tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria who are hospitalized with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Heart Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with weakly expressed symptoms of COVID19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had diagnosed COVID19 with light symptoms that did not require hospitalization were invited.
Pregnant breastfeeding and not using effective contraceptive means, women cannot participate in the study.
In Italy, several coagulants are under test.
Low-sized heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicine Authority to publish recommendations for the use of the drug.
On 14 April, Italy announced a multi-central study involving 300 patients to study the use of sodium enossaparine in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and Western Neil virus.
Ribbyrin: Fisheries were recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umiphenovanizer: Recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics, which have been considered potentially suitable for COVID19 treatment:
Tocilysumab (Anti-L-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID19.
The COVID-19 Vaccination is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that a vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus would be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates undertook phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the major outbreak of the disease spread throughout the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and research in its connection.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, productive capacity, extensive deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technology platforms for establishing an effective vaccine against COVID19.
Some of the main objectives of the platforms included in Phase I security studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRNC-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are at an early stage of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); further 37 vaccines were reported, but few available (probably planned or developed).
Phase I-II provides preliminary security and immunogenic testing, typically randomized, placebo controlled and in several sites with a simultaneous definition of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III of the test usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, drugs are tested to prevent disease and side effects are monitored in optimal dosage.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested for the person (there are still a pre-clinical research stage).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular pressure vaccine that genetically modified virus proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the commencement of work on its own vaccine in order to start testing in people in 2021.

Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate that could be protested in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Medical Research and Material Command, Fort Detrick, and the Army Research Institute of Walter Reid, Sylver Spring, located in the western state of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccines.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had become a partnership with Novax Inc.
To develop and produce a vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for stage I and clinical testing by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even accelerating vaccine development would take at least one and a half years.
On 12 March 2020, the Medicago, the biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Studies, they had created a particle similar to that of the crownavirus.
The potential vaccine is carried out in laboratory studies and people are being tested for July or August 2020.
Previously this week The Guardian reported that the U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “great amounts” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the Government of Germany protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American Pfizer pharmaceutical company announced a partnership with the German BioNTech company to develop a joint IRNC-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNC-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing doclinary tests and the clinical tests will commence in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it would receive the results of the doclinic tests in April 2020, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing on people in autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Preparedness (CEPI), France, announced that $4.9 million had been invested in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium with the Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inova, Novax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-implified RNA-Vaccin from COVID-19.
A vaccine prepaid was developed within 14 days of the receipt of a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID19, including the development of numerous vaccine pills in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian Government has announced the allocation of $192 million specifically to develop a COVID19 vaccine, as well as plans for the establishment of a national “bank of vaccines”, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the crownero.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at Pittsburgh University Medical School reported a PittCoVac test, a possible vaccine against COVID19 on mice, stating that “MNA had introduced sub-divided SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigenic special antibodies [in mice] that were manifested two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Farmacectic School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine that might be produced in the form of a nasal spray.
The DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless virus particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM supercomputers, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computations.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-special effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to those of disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
vaccines may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on vaccine efficiency assessment using animal models, for which COVID-19 is characterized, such as ACE2 transgender mouses, other laboratory animals and low primates, indicate the need for measures to control the infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized security procedures.
Vaccinations against SARS and MERS were tested at animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or protective vaccines to treat SARS that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat a typical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS began to be distributed, it was believed that the SARS study, which was conducted at that time, could be a standard for vaccines and therapeutics development against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which was phase I of clinical testing, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus vector-based vaccines and were in development, two of them adenoviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one to MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of conspiracy was distributed in social networks, stating that the COVID19 virus was not new and that it already exists.
Publications in social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents for genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS coronarius, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) that is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing difficulties.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscular pain, diarrhea, throat pain, humidity, and abdominal pain.
The period from the first symptoms to the peak is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are related to light symptoms, but in some cases the disease is spreading into viral pneumonia and polyorganal inadequacy.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 people died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have been relieved, and the virus is mostly spread by close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops released in the air when coughing, chewing, or talking.
Although these droplets are formed at the outflow, they are usually threatened by falling on the ground or on the surface but are not transmitted through the air at large distances.
People are also infected with the contaminated surface and then with their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can live 72 hours on the surface.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after the symptoms, although it can be spread both before the symptoms and at later stages.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspicion of disease and to caregivers.
The recommendations on the use of medical masks differ: some agencies recommend no use, some recommend use and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
The local spread of the disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may have no symptoms or symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing.
Extreme symptoms include constrained breathing, constant pain or a feeling of quelling in the chest, confusion of consciousness, procrastination difficulties, faculty or lips; if the symptoms mentioned above are present, immediate medical assistance should be sought.
Symptoms of high - breathing diseases, such as chewing, pumping, or pain in the throat, can be less common.
Also, different percentage ratios of venom and nutrient symptoms, such as boiling, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been observed.
Some of the diseases registered in China have initially been shown only by a sense of quelling in the chest and heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress through pneumonia, polyorganic inadequacy, and ultimately death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually between five and six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of people, symptoms start to occur within 11.5 days of infection, and the symptoms are reportedly not for all infected persons.
The role of such non-symptom carriers in the transmission of the disease is still unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with unsimplemented infections is currently unknown and is only studied; Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the disease have been unsimplemal.
China ' s National Health Commission has begun to include unsimplemented cases in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78 per cent) have refused unsimplemented at the time of testing.
Both wetness and slut can have a greater concentration of the virus.
There are more droplets in the air when loud speech is spoken than normal volume.
A study in Singapore revealed that droplets could be extended to a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) in open cough.
The virus is typically not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences suggested that the transmission of particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and the testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the rooms showed the existence of a virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resilience (ASD), can lead to the dispersal of extraction products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can be spread through facalia, but the risk is considered low; the virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is usually infected by two to three others; the virus is able to survive from hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could live for one day on the card surface, on the plastic surface (polypropiled) and on the stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on 99 per cent of the copper surfaces up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and cleaning tools, with the right use, have a relatively useful effect on the control of contamination: soap destroys the fat-protective layer of the virus by deactivated it and is able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as bensalconium chloride and chloroxydine gluconat (chirurgent disinfectant) are less effective against the virus.
Five out of six patients had the first test showing the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient had the highest blood content detected on the second day of the test.
The heavy acute respiratory coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe coronavirus respiratory syndrome, first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in coronavirus kinship.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that opens it to a protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most susceptible organ of COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cell through angiotensin-extra-energy enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and penetrates into the brain cell by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein, a pinch.
12 per cent of people infected with the Hospital in Huhan have diagnosed severe injuries to the Miocardium, which are more common in severe forms of disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic combustion responses and immune disorders occurring during the progress of the disease, but acute damage to the myocardium can also be due to the presence of receptors ACE2 in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are present in large amounts in the heart as they are involved in the work of the body.
The high frequency of trombosis (31 per cent) and venosis trumpboembologies (25 per cent) was observed by patients in the ITU from COVID19 and could indicate unfavourable predictions.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism in ACE2-Expressive Respiratory Cells, there are symptoms of systemic hyper-spiriture for patients with a heavy COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that the pathogenic TCSF T cells correlate with inflammatory IL-6 monocytes and heavy lung pathology for patients from COVID-19.
Limmphociary infiltractions were also detected at the opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols on this disease.
Real-time chain reaction (RT-CPD) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhino-wheeling, but the nose or wet masculine model may also be used.
The results are usually ready for a period of between hours and two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at a interval of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic consistency so that scientists around the world can develop the tests by means of a polymerial chain reaction (PTC) to identify the existence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies that could detect infection at the present time, as well as potential infections in the past, were under development but were not yet widely disseminated.
China ' s experience with research on the results of these tests has shown that they are only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Medicine Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first local diagnosis test, authorizing its application at the end of this month.
Bilateral multi-dependent sub-pleural focuses of mat-glazing with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposteriore distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-pleural dominance, the symptom of a boulder bridge (tree dumping of a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic damages and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological research carried out in the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleuvrit, pericardite, damping and lungs
There are four types of gravity of the virus pneumonia:
light pneumonia: pneumonia, hyperpalasis of pneumonia, large pneumonia pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphociary infiltraction and multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with a defuse alveolar escort.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distributor syndrome (SDS) and heavy hypoxemia.
Resident pneumonia: organization of exsurates in alveolar fields and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffosene inward bleaching (DVC syndrome); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of contamination include staying at home, avoiding people's places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with the rules of breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with indifferent hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose of the salphette be covered with coughing or chewing, or, in the absence of a salfette, the mouth and nose be covered by the inner side of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or chewing, it is recommended that a quality hygienic procedure be conducted for the hands.
The Centre for the Control and Prevention of Illness (CDC) recommends the use in public places of fossil masks, inter alia, to limit the transmission of infections to persons with unsymptomal transmission; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and enterprises have been closed, limited to the movement of citizens and large public activities.
The distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
No medication with validated effectiveness against COVID-19 is available, since the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the main part of the COVID-19 measures is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “pace-to-do”.
CDC also recommends more often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or heavy hand contamination, and before eating and after cutting, cough or chewing.
CDC also recommends the use of a disinfecting alcohol-containing (average 60 per cent alcohol) hand-processing tool, but only when soap and water are not available. WHO provides two receptors for local production to regions where such disinfecting products are not sold.
These compositions use ethanol or ispropanol with antimicrobial activity.
The hydrogen transfusion is used to eliminate bacterial disputes in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for the antiseptic processing of hands.
Glycerol is added as wetland.
Patients are shown a supportive therapy that may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support to other vitally affected bodies.
CDC recommends that those suspected of infected with the virus wear a common medical mask.
Extra-correct membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address breathing deficiency, but its benefits are still being explored.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet be respected.
Supportive therapy techniques can be shown to patients with light symptoms at early stages of disease. WHO and China ' s National Health Commission issued recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive therapists and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific COVID-19 treatment.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some medical professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acsetaminophen) in comparison with ibprofen.
In the course of procedures in which air-cape emissions, such as intubation or hand-shot, are likely to occur, precautionary measures should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
The CDC recommends that medical caregivers from COVID-19 be placed in an air-capital centre (AIIR) as an additional measure in addition to standard precautionary measures in relation to contacts and air. CDC published recommendations on the use of individual defences (SIS) during the pandemic.
Recommendations for individual protection: protective hat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and gloves.
Respirators N95 have been approved for use in industrial conditions, but FDA has permitted the use of these respirators in accordance with an emergency application permit (EUA).
They are designed to protect themselves from particles in the air, such as dust, but when using a directive, the protection of a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective displays or, in the extreme case, the preparation of masks in the home.
In most cases the form of COVID-19 is not sufficiently heavy to require an artificial ventilation of the lung or its alternative, but there is also a percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a nose of oxygen canal with intensive air flow or a two-level positive breathing pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical condition are as effective as IWL.
Some doctors choose invasive lung mechanical ventilation, if available, as this method substantially limits the spread of particles in the air compared with the intensity of airlines, the risk of serious illness for older persons (over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital hotels per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in COVID-19 in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
According to one study in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy offices, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent had died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID19 are eventually in intensive care.
The artificial ventilation of lungs is compounded, as acute respiratory distrix syndrome (ARDS) developed at COVID-19 and oxygenation has become increasingly problematic.
The IDP, with support from the breath pressure and ADCs, is required to deliver the maximum quantity of oxygen in the lungs and to ensure the minimum damage to the ventilation that can result in the pneumotorax.
In early ventilators, high ACVs may not be available.
Research on potential treatments commenced in January 2020 and several anti-virus drugs are currently under clinical test.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
The development of new medications may last until 2021, but some of the tested drugs have already been approved for other purposes or are at the latest stages of the test.
Anti-virusive drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in the testing of the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. FDA provided temporary permission to use reconnaissance plasma as a pilot treatment where human life is at risk of serious or immediate risks.
It was not subject to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number for login.
The annex may detect “absorption” through observation data and thus determine the potential risk of contamination.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the annex not only recommends self-inclusion but also sends a notification to local health authorities; an analysis of the large data collected from mobile phones, the detection technology, the tracking of mobile phones and artificial intellectuals is used to track infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor data from mobile phones of people who were allegedly infected by the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure the penetration and protection of persons who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, for the purpose of research and prevention of the spread of the Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Government institutions of Germany and Robert Koha Institute provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, a person recognition technology was introduced to identify carantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Julio Galler, said that the cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of the people still travel through the territory”.
The Government of Germany held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with over 42,000 participants.
President Kerstie Kalulaid of Estonia also called for creative solutions against the spread of the crownvirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Aggravated social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being”.
The disease may flow lightly with minor or missing symptoms that resemble other prevalent upheaval diseases, such as normal cold.
Patients with a light form of disease tend to be cured for two weeks, whereas patients with severe or critical forms may need three to six weeks in order to treat patients.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of receiving a heavy COVID-19 form on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data for COVID-19, some people may be affected by light COVID-19 and cause pneumonia as complications.
Those with the most severe leakage of COVID19 may rapidly progress into a sharp respiratory distributor syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory deficiency, septic shock or polyorganization.
Complications COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalal trumping, and heart problems, kidneys and liver.
Trombonization anomaly, especially an increase in pro-femiliar time, was described by 6 per cent of the patients who were hospitalized from COVID-19 while the kidney function was broken by 4 per cent of the group.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients from COVID-19 have increased their liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive therapy office was seven days.
Research in early cases showed that the average time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range of between 6 and 41 days.
According to a study carried out by China ' s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Hystopatological studies on the death of lung samples show a defuse alveolar damage to cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Virus cytopatic changes were observed in pneumonia.
The appearance of light respirator respirator was resembled by the sharp respiratory syndrome (BRDS).
In the 11.8 per cent of the deaths registered by China ' s National Health Commission, the problems with the heart were to increase the troponein or to stop the heart.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to health and socio-economic resources in the region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates varied depending on the condition because of these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective calculation of light-form cases could lead to an overstatement of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers have developed severe symptoms of COVID-19 as a whole 1.4 times as often as they are, and these patients are about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die in comparison with non-smokers, and concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of one Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had reduced the volume of lungs by 20 to 30 per cent and had detected damage.
After healing, it can also lead to the syndrome “after intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovered from the virus had a persistent immunity against them.
This is considered likely by other crown-viruses, but also reported cases where the crown-virus tests were still positive after healing from COVID-19.
In these cases, it is believed that the prolonged prevalence of the disease was protracted rather than reinfected.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to its transmission from human beings.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures varied depending on the region and the time of the disease, also affected the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes, the time from the outbreak of the disease and the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO awarded emergency-assistance codes for ICRC-10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The ratio of deaths and contaminations is the number of deaths committed to diagnosed cases within a given period of time.
According to the University of Jones Hopkins statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and contamination cases is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240,191).
This figure varies from region to region, and some other methods include the definition of the mortality rate of the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the mortality rate resulting from the transmission of the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosed as well as non-diagnostic cases) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect a certain segment of the population from the time the disease is contaminated to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all patients who have endured infections, these antibodies are available to understand how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castillon d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to the donor blood rate.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates differs from men to women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The largest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise causes of this discrepancy are unknown but may be genetic and behavioural.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertonia in men younger than in women) can lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to be infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, explains: “CO” means “coron”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” is “disease” and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid a reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is called the heavy coronavirus respirator syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In WHO public communications, the term “virus COVID-19” and “virus responsible for COVID-19” are further used.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly called the Crown Virus.
During the initial outbreak in Ouhan, China, virus and disease were commonly referred to as “Kronavirus” and “Hungarian crownvirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical locations in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended that the term " acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov" and "2019-nCV" be used as temporary names of virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, official titles were published, “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2”.
Owing to the limitations on standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as tampon tubons to take masts from their nose as well as the details of IWL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frames, while one of the local productions was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves in the night.
Since the first time COVID-19, various conspiracy, disinformation and freak information on the origin of the virus, its size, prevention, treatment and other aspects have become available on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect the virus of other animals.
Research has not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine against virus or medicine for treatment.
Various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID-19 are being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims at assessing the treatment effect of four existing compounds considered most effective to date.
There is no vaccine ready yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidates for the vaccine.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells through the ACE2 receptor, so research results from previous SARS-CoV studies are used.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to establish a whole-virian vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at causing a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunit vaccine, aims at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies are aimed at the destruction of S-shipositive Protein, which helps the virus enter the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA Vaccine, a new vaccine method).
Experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be checked for safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from a disease-generating virus, which has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests have been conducted.
The preparates approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were hydroxychlorochine or chlorochine.
The reprofiling of anti-virus drugs is a large part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of Remdecision phase III were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for treatment of COVID19 was carried out, and for the same purpose, several other existing anti-virus drugs for treatment of COVID19, including remdesivir, chlorochine and hydroxychlorochin, latinavir / ritonevire, as well as lopinavir / ritonvire, combined with beta interferone.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of the remdesvier.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III of the clinical tests is already taking place in the United States, China and Italy, and the use of chloroquine used previously for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
Nevertheless, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Uhani Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose in one gram, but notes that the dose doubled is very dangerous and can lead to a lethal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued a permit for the extreme use of hydroxychlorochine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients from COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses are needed for SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxandid was recommended for a detailed study in vivo by showing that SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited in low concentrations, and studies showed that in order to penetrate SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor, it was necessary to reconcile the squirrel of trans-emembraced proteas sulphur 2 (TMPRSS2).
Research on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychlorochine with or without azitromicine has severe limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.
A hypercytokinymia may arise as a complication at later stages of the heavy form COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can be a hypercytokienic characteristic of hypercytokienia, as a result of a small study by China ' s National Health Commission, the recommendation for the treatment of the crownuvirus was included in the Tocilysumub.
This drug has been carried out at 2 stages of a non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with a severe form of disease.
In combination with a blood serum analysis on perritis to detect cytokin storms, it is intended to counter factors that are believed to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved antagonist of the receptor of interleikin-6 on the basis of retrospective case studies to treat the release of steroid refraction syndrome from another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
To date, there are no randomized and controlled evidence that tocismuab is an effective means of treating the cytokini release syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune patients recovered from COVID19 to those who need them is now considered a non-vaccinary method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS patients, but its results have not been convincing.
The nitralization of the virus is an expected effect that passive antibody therapy can protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-telo-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be used.
Other forms of passive therapy by antibodies, such as monochlonal antibodies, are at the stage of development.
The use of reconnaissance serum can be increased, consisting of a liquid part of the blood of the recovered patients and containing antibodies against the virus.
Crown-virus disease, high-speed syndrome
Le Wennian, a doctor at the Uhani central clinic, who later became infected and died of COVID19 after the spread of the virus was reported.
