The social map of the inhabitants of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Changes provide for the maintenance of travel concessions in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the provision of concessional travel for citizens has changed with the use of a social map of the resident of the Ivanov region.
According to the press service of the Russian Government for the Ivanova region, the changes provide for the maintenance of travel benefits in public passenger transport and bring the social map together with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 on the National Pay System.
At the same time, the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivanov region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
Thus, the replenishment limit is now not set for travel, as previously, but for money, with winter and summer periods not exceeding 400 roubles, and during the summer period not more than 800 roubles for the current month.
Societal receipts will now need to be monitored, not by the number of remaining trips, but by the balance of funds.
The cost of concessional travel for citizens would be 1/2 of the tariff operating in the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel reimburses the regional budget.
The timetable for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from 24 counts of the previous month to 23 times the current month.
The new order of the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep the spending of money in a detailed manner on the social map accurately up to the copies.
In addition, there is a possibility of returning outstanding but unutilized funds.
Add also that the cost of the cost of travel is now half of the cost of travel paid by a citizen, and the same amount compensates the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged when making a cash map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, the Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of Ivanov, reported that more than 33 million social-purpose visits were made in 2014, and nearly 25 million visits were made in the region in 2015.
The provincial budget for concessional travel provided for more than 470 million roubles for citizens using a social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement for this purpose amounted to over 312 million roubles.
On the call of 911, a teacher is admitted to murdering a friend
During the 911-wing call, the teacher of the waist Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that they needed officers to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there's a "pesic" in the house that's alive, but is probably upset, and said that contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentis' body and a note written negligently on a white leaf of lined paper: "I wish I could all return, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says a note, according to the representatives of the bodies signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to the university campaign, where the police believed he had shot all the distinguished professor of Ethan Schmidt's history at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police of the University of Delta Linn Baford reported that the university had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb had made that true call 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will face one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting at the school led the students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities still tried to put the motivation that Lamba built into one picture.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff members who knew him, helped to compile a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students told me that they looked forward to his studies.
The police in Gothyah, where Prentis died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book in which he expressed appreciation for the "pretty people" with whom he crossed in his teaching life.
Both of them taught 17 teachers at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, and many students attended lectures.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lambe, Brandon Bivers, reported that he was also worried and nervous, "as if he was not okay."
Another student, Michael Saix, reported that Lamb, at the end of the school year 2014-15, told him how he was coping with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the University of Delta to give him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the doctor ' s degree in which Lamb worked so hard would not guarantee him automatic appointment as a teacher.
William Laforge, president of the University, reported that he knew nothing about the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but "it's obvious that Mr. Lamb had something in mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lamb after he escaped from the campaign when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, the Lamb shot 38 calibres at the back of the house, one mile south of the house of her parents in Greenville, Mississippi, reported to the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His engine was still standing on the driveway.
It was incomprehensible why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those lands.
Lamb began to work at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and teaching.
He was given a degree of pedagogical doctor in the spring of that year.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and fun person.
Carl Hairston told me that she was 15 and Lambu was 20 when they met with common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a great old man who's been trying to teach her to play the guitar for a few years.
In those years, he had been successful with women.
All the girls were hiding when he was there," says Hairston, who's now 40 and who lives in Jackson, the Brendon suburbs.
Lamb and Prentis have probably met for a while by the moment.
During the 911 Lamb call, he said, "I killed my wife," but there was no record of their marriage.
A couple had a dog named Lytning who lived with them in Gothya in a brick house, whose back side goes to a channel.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Prentis' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's completely depressed," told O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't dating Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing bluz.
Lamb met Printis when he and Abigail both were on one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman, and co-member, the facilitator of the entertainment programs in the lighted bar The Julep Room in the front of Gothia, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentis in the evening of 5 September, when the Lamb finished playing the guitar and the lip pharmacy for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and chirping on each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a teacher who died, conducted seminars for first-trainers and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, explained to Don Allan Mitchell, English teacher in the same educational institution.
He was married and he had three young children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporiya and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the Delta University in Cleveland, on Tuesday night, some 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial incitement ceremony of candles.
The wife of Schmidta Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The sessions will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to return our students," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report assisted the authors of the Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santan in New Orleans.
The material was edited as a result of the police statement that Lamb’s call was 911 after Shmidt was killed, and that, although Lamb spoke of his wife as his wife when he called at 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not hire the same employees for the holiday season as last year, with the child toy and goods marketer assured that it would provide staff and temporary staff with more hours of work.
The company reports that it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and on whole country bases, which is less than 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with the claimants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although some months before holidays, the buying season is getting closer, and companies are preparing for the hiring of temporary staff to have enough state in the shops and for the sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding Princess Diana about a date.
The premiere of the "Rear to the Future" film was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater and waiting for the royal family to come, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was embarrassed, and I would be sitting next to Princess Diana," he told the trailer about the documentary "Narward in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at the length of my hand and in one false ring from a date with Princess Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary film on Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Lia Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Sparberg.
The premiere of the "Rear to the Future" film took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, it's undoubtedly the greatest movie about travel in time that has ever been filmed."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and some movie theaters in October.
The Head of the United Nations states that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that, for almost five years of conflict, “the military solution does not exist” and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called upon all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated to the press conference on Wednesday that he planned a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council, the United States, Russia, China, the Great Britain and France, during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, had “delivered the situation”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity as they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme for Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 results of the survey that show that Donald Trump is not kidding
Some tried to label him as a provocator.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some demand a scandal.
But as some republicans try to break down the high position of Donald Trump in the results of the surveys, they have failed (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed the advantage of Donald Trump in dual numbers, and some began to seriously ask what it meant for real estate magnet in terms of chances of nomination.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to be named by the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Ricka Perry had given up his prominence to Herman Kane, none of whom had won the same state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Political Action Surgeon and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognize the unrestrained force of the Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to overthrow it.
These are some of the figures of the surveys that show that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
A sympathetic rating for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Directly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans favoured this real estate magnet.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
This was 52 per cent in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude toward Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week revealed that 60 per cent of the Republicans there favourably refer to the Trump.
Two thirds of GOP voters would have put Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either "thankful" or "satisfaction" if the Temp had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be upset if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates an approximate level of enthusiasm, such as Trump (43% say they would be “thankful ” to 40% of those who say the same about Tempa).
Next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be “unsatisfied” or “disturbed” if Jeb Bush is favored as a candidate.
Most Republicans do not view the Temperature as a problem.
While Trumpa is severely criticized for his boasting and insulting, 52 per cent of those inclined to republican voters throughout the country think that the magnat has a suitable temperature to be President, as the ABC News/Washington post survey showed on Monday.
The same figure is shown in the first closed congregation in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans think he's the same person who may be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective in posting, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to that idea.
When they wear their wagons hats, the Republican voters think that Temp is serious.
On the question of who was the most likely winner of GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that the Temp was a favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's no longer true when four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had no right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the potential candidate Mitta Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Tramp campaign to be persuasive.
Even if the Republicans were to join around another candidate, the Temple was still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such dispersion is likely to be the advantage of the Trump, and at the same time, the unsupporting Tempas are equally distributed among supporters of more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical “one” competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Temp almost always receives support from the majority.
He's outsourcing Carlis Fiorin at 13 points, Marko Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Bush at 19 points, and finally Rend Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He's got nothing with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who cares for him?
Ben Carson has driven a businessman to 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one for one."
Less than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the voters who support the Tempa say they are certain of their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that it will never change.
46 per cent said that they left the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition of Trump at the moment, with a colleague-autsayder, is Ben Carson, but the voters who say that they have reconsidered would likely choose the Tempa.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with the Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago identified immigrants from Mexico as “violent” in his campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that the Trimpa conspiracy would turn the key voters of Latin American origin away from the Republican party and would hinder the rebanding.
But according to an ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say that they agree with the Tempas on immigration.
Thus, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The Government's disappointment is taking new turns.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now counting on support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as autsayders.
Seven out of 10 Republicans on Monday, a new ABC/Post survey stated that they wanted a political autsayder rather than a person with a government experience.
And they're also offended in Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Republicans in Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfactory” and 21 per cent “in anger”.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indexes in October.
The Vice-Primeur R.F. Olga Holocaustz stated that the Government was looking for options for implementing the pension indexation law in 2016 to a real level of inflation, transmitting the WG.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, the cabmin discusses the prolongation of the decision to freeze the accumulated Russian pension.
The hungerer noted that the pension accumulation amounted to 350 billion roubles.
Approximately the same cost is full pension indexing for next year.
According to the Vice-President, there is no final decision on who to pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Famine believes that if a person does not work on his or her own initiative and does not apply to socially disadvantaged categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for him.
Previously, the media reported that the cabmina was considering two options for the State budget balance.
Why are ages often irritated and redened?
An offtalmologist responds to Tatian Levosov:
Our ages are the widths that protect the eye apple from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting a regular era, we often contribute to the development of a blépharite.
Logout simple:
Don't keep your eyes dirty with your hands, and wear with you a special wet salphette for the ages.
No less than 1-2 times a day purify the edge of the ages of the accumulated in them in the day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures shall be complemented by warm compressions with the meat-vehicles (shalpheas, romachines) that fuel the dense secret of salt irons and then by the massage of the edges of the age to be carried out by the circular movements of the fingers;
Don't use alcoholic means when cheating on the makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to the deepening of the secret of salt glands.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclei have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yonben nuclear complex, works “to full power”.
This was reported on the country ' s Central Telegraph Agency website.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat of the United States” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “as by quantity as well as by quality”.
The latest nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans to resume the full functioning of the reactor have since not been reported.
Pyongyang claims he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK also repeatedly tested medium- and small-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zyrinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian hymn.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Girinovsky believes that a reference to a fraternal union should be removed from the national hymn.
He said that during the meeting of the Lord's House, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and killers!
"Very long hymn, the longest in the world, not even the athletes,," said Girinovski.
The deputy believes that all four persons should be removed, containing this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zyrinovsky stated that the current hymn needs to be changed to "God, King Save", and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Asaad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
President Bashar Asad of Syria called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Asaad is sure that Europe must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East if it wants to deal with the problem of refugees.
The question is, not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If the Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on this problem.
"This is the question of refugees," he said in an RT interview.
We must continue the dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible as long as people die while bloodshed continues and people feel safe.
“In this way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot realize anything until we win terrorism in Syria,” Asaad stressed.
Recall that some 500,000 migrants, including Syria, have arrived in the European Union during the year.
The European Commission stated that the current migration crisis in the world has been the largest since the Second World War.
Thousands of militants of extremist “Islamic State” may be included among the arrival migrants in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
German residents set up a holiday for refugees.
In the past month, Germany has become a leader in hosting refugees, although it has recently strengthened border controls to contain their influx.
The authorities have estimated that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call significant numbers.
More than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country since the beginning of September.
Jenny Hill, BB, correspondent, visited Darmstadt, whose residents have a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin is debuting to the Prime Minister ' s session
Following the election of Mr. Korbin, his debut at the session of the Prime Minister is expected with great interest
The new leader of the Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will shortly speak to the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of the six issues on the afternoon; he will likely follow the press and members of Parliament from the Leiborist Party closely.
He called for a “littleer theater and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that some meetings could be missed by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Korbin as leader; it will take place after he has been appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual convention of the Tred Junion on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader of the lieborists to stand silent during the execution of the national hymn in service on Tuesday, and during the 75th anniversary of Bitwa for Britain, criticized a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several best-practicing articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a public hymn attracted attention
The Spokesman, Mr. Corbin, stated that he “was in a respectful silence” and recognized the “Geroism of the Royal Air Forces in Bitwa for Britain”.
However, a member of the shadow cabinet, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, informed Newsnight to BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the Leibers to sing the national hymn “independently” of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to play a team of Mr. Korbin, reflecting differences in economic, defence and international policies, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brent said that political differences would also be “scraped by a stack” in the Leiborist party after Mr. Corbin was appointed to serve in the European Union and limiting compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin said at the conference of the Tred Junion, that the Leiborist Party had amended the idea of limitations as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow Minister of Labour and Pensions, stated that the party had “full clarity” because it had been in opposition only to government plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Leibers, with whom David Cameron will meet at the Cuerie Box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the lieborist, who promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “entered collective resources” in order to get the ideas of Mr. Chamberon's issues and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
Aidington Nort, a member of Parliament, stated that the Prime Minister ' s questions were undue confrontation and that he would refrain from the witty responses and exchanges of collisions, instead of promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems faced by young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economy in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was not present, for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also explained the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor when possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Communities to John Berkow to discuss the matter.
As leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to abandon the political style of the "yarmar Balagana", which was often associated with the Prime Minister ' s procedure, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s issues have become a key indicator of the leadership ' s views, their ability to govern the House of Communities and their reputation among other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.

Growth of sterling as British wages increase
A surplus pound versus wage growth in Britain, with the FTSE 100 index raised by the proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, wages in Britain, less bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate has proved to be the highest since 2009 and has been seen as a shift to an earlier time of projections on possible growth of caterings.
Pound sterling grew by more than 1% in relation to the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro, or €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index has grown to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller shares were elevated by 20 per cent as a result of the proposal for a purchase from a competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite the two largest beer companies in the world, gathering brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares grew by 0.9% in the background of encouraging news from the competing group of Lux Richemont producers.
Richemont's recent sales data exceeded all the expectations and showed that the sales in China -- on the key market for Burberry -- began to grow again.
Glencore had increased by 5 per cent after the mining giant had announced that it had been able to obtain $2.5 billion by putting shares in the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi stocks of the Mondi paper and packaging group were leaders of the fall in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to “sale”.
JD Sports increased after the sports-producing company reported an increase of 83 per cent in pre-tax profits for six months to £46.6 million.
The Chief of JD Sports says that higher wages can hinder expansion.
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Caugull says that the increase in the minimum wage for British workers means “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will cost more than an increase in labour costs, he says.
Expenses could have an impact on plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The optical food provider, on the bottom initiative, launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA Rieters in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming influence of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two whole warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and Western Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food providers and promote brand IGA through marketing in leading media and social networks and in events like Adelaide Show.
The campaign is joined by IGA Ryglers and suppliers, such as the Simmo's ice cream producer from Dansboro, who offers degostation in IGA stores, and the owners of stores selling permanent clients tickets to the South Australian football League match.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day that this optimal food provider, alcoholic beverages and business products will hold its annual investor strategy day.
There is much to be done, since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA brand shops account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show more cost-effectiveness than Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as traditional routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA Rieters than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in UA and 24 per cent in WA compared to approximately 14 per cent in eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will consume 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first stores, taking the marketing volume from all players present, but mainly from independent Richlers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA Rhealers can lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The projection is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, reaching $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at a high level of constant costs of Metcash could cost the company about 13 million incomes before interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat believed.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the market in eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and knomers, and this is the fact that a recent study of Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is believed that the sales of Metcash food will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the share of the company in the market from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the lead Fiscal Manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed the business lunch in Melbourne, that Metcash “can disappear for a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But a member of the Metcash Board of Directors is expected to contact Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has declined from 18 per cent to 14 per cent from 2010, and the Metcash income from the food business, which the company has provided to approximately 1,200 IGA Residents, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012 as a result of the operational delegation and because of the pressure on sales and profitability rates.
Nevertheless, the company does not surrender, spending over $150 million annually to align retail prices with horsemen and Woolworths at thousands of positions weekly and assisting IGA Rieters to re-engineer trade sites, as well as offering a rapid expansion of fresh products and wider selection of firm foodstuffs.
Director-General Metcash Ian Morris said that price equations and trade areas were being converted and hoped that the company would gain an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hill
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis suffered indirectly in a recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more respect than critics, says President Tennis Australia Steve Hill.
Kokkinakis, a younger in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was immediately at the centre of attention due to the shameful intercourse of Kiryos with Stan Vavrinka on the tournament of Montreal Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualification match at the Cincinnatti, a judge had to double distinguish Kokkinakis and his adversary Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Vaurienka had to lay on the shovels of Kiryos, and I have to lay the shovels on this guy."
Since Kokkinakis's last sight of a missile raiding after a shipwreck in his leg saved Richard Gaske from the possible defeat on the US Open, Hili loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgo, competing with Sam Groth for the second post-Bernard Tomić in the semi-final of the Davis Cube against Britain.
"I'm very worried about one thing, that's what Tanasi's got into the conflict," said Hili.
He really broke a rocket when he was pulling his foot on US Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the missile when hopes broke out, and I know Tanasi enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he owned himself very well in pretty provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been treated a little dishonestly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's a lot of work, he's a great team, he's never had problems with other players, he's respected outside the cortex, he's intensively trained, he's in great shape, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he's worthy of it.
Hili also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match beginning on Friday, relying on the “conciliation” to be the right way for all, but expecting a guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"Often of all we want the team to focus fully on the match, not on the disputes around [Kirosa]," said Hili.
And I think Nick gained strength very quickly, which proves that Federer and Marrey are growing in front of the public, he has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think that he needs to be taken out of the center for a while so that he can think about them, and that's best for the team and the best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares an emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
In announcement of a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on Tuesday at the southern border and delayed those who attempted to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants.
There were riots on the border, hundreds of migrants accumulating in the border area, and the Serbian authorities reacted severely.
Stalled indefinitely in the road crossing between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing from armed violence in their homeland broke tents and settled in the area.
However, there was growing dissatisfaction.
When a police helicopter rang over them, migrants shouted "Cover the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian police of a special appointment.
Some protested against food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared “unpleasant” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they were increasingly arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of a solution, not a related damage.
Negotiations should be held with Brussels and other countries in the near future”, stated in Prague, Ivica Dachich.
The waves at the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after a cluster of 28 countries had been unable to formulate a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to have a common responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that, in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year), there would be an agreement that the States members of the European Union would receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angel Mercel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded that the European Summit be convened next week to discuss the immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect an early action on the part of Brussels or neighbours.
The emergency announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to cross roads and expedite asylum cases.
In the meantime, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country was also planning to raise a barbed wire at a border with Romania to close the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had finished the fence at the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners had been connected to urgent work to complete a barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “little place” and the crossing point of the Euro-Count for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees who are victims of wars in Syria and in the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people who have arrived in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugees who are victims of the war that are entitled to protection, and that view is very different from that of other EU countries, as in Germany.
The new laws that entered into force in Hungary at midnight are now regarded as a crime of crossing or damage to a 4-metre (13-foot) fence from a barbed wire built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for the accused of trafficking.
“On account of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency”, said to journalists the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovać in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
The formal Parliament must still authorize the deployment of military forces expected next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press, who are at the border, have observed the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for several days.
Dr. Bakondi, National Security Advisor, reported a survey by authorized authorities of 45 persons trying to cross the border at the border and another 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, being detained by the police and being accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities quickly recover the fence.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning by harnessing one of the passages of the railway car with a barbed wire.
The riots broke out on the main passage across the border of the city of Ryoske (Hungary) because the Vengra placed a service room to pass people inside the metal container, and crowds pushed each other to break in.
Approximately 20 people were caught inside, and thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main road leading from Serbia to Hungary and declared no food and water until they were released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillari Clinton over Bernard Sanders declined twice in the national survey
The former Secretary of State of Hillari Clinton continues to hold a double advantage in the Democrats ' race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent among primary democrat voters (from 58 per cent below), while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives support from 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the beginning of rivalry in the primary elections, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have been identified with the candidate to whom they will support.
Clinton's supporters are more confident of their choice than those of other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and the moderate, but this has decreased.
Her support for men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind it.
The premise given by Clinton by democratic voters for up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overcame Sanders for a two-digit number among Liberians, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary democrat voters throughout the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she had become a candidate for the party.
Four would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not have supported it.
It may not be surprising that the current supporters of Clinton will likely show more enthusiasm in her account.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, the views are more controversial -- only about a quarter of its enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democrat voters say that they would be enthusiastically supportive of Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Klinton's supporters ask an open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular response is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a Presidency (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also refer to the association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It's also called the agreement on issues and the chances of election.
As the Vice-President considers potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third believes that he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among party candidates, the primary democrat voters in most cases called Baiden.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half they would have chosen Baiden the second, it's more than Sanders.
If Baiden decides not to stand out from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton ' s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without it.
Fifty-five per cent of democratic voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, that figure has declined from 78 per cent in the past month.
According to this figure, Baiden, with a large backlog in the second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate, has increased.
However, responding to the question that is most important to the candidate, the Democratic voters choose other options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, in the past month, no candidate for democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominant for these primary voters.
Democrat candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and credible people with good leadership qualities.
Baiden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who speak the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain view of it.
Primary democratic voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baiden as similar.
On all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While the question of the personal mail and server of Hillari Clinton continues to be asked by the Secretary-General, the majority of the primary democratic voters are satisfied with its explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general view of it.
But this is a very different story in the American public as a whole.
Half the Americans are today unsatisfactory in their explanation, and only about one third are satisfied.
The views of the public on this matter were shared in March shortly after the story was known.
Most Americans say that the debate on e-mail has not affected their general view of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinions on it have deteriorated.
Mostly, they are Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinions about Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered to be honest and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 per cent regard it as honest and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Tramp to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump both, however, receive good leadership marks.
Of the six protested candidates, Baiden, Carson and Bush show the best outcome on honesty.
Most see a fairer person in Sanders rather than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The limit for the sample of 351 primary democrat voters is 6 percentage points.
Based on a national survey, Ben Carson was close to Donald Tramp.
Ben Carson came close to Donald Tramp in the last CBS/New York Times survey.
Two candidates obtained half of the voters in the new poll, leaving all others in search of support under the legs
The Republican voters throughout the country continue to support the Tempa, whose support increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson enjoys support in all demographic groups, as the Tempa embarked on a group of top-education voters.
The remaining candidates, except Carlis Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Casic, retreated with Governor Visconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and senator of Florida Marco Rubio, took a third of 6 per cent together.
The limit for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6 per cent, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in surveys, showing support for 19 per cent among Republicans, with 32 per cent of support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that the Temple was significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's support increased last week, Trump made several critical attacks against the former neurosurgus, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," said Trump last Saturday at the close of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of the Baruch College high school
About two years after the death of a college student during the fraternity ritual in Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was filed against five persons.
"The Pi Delta Psy Brotherhood of the New York College Baruch was brutally attacked by Denga Chan Maikla during the commemoration in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," reported to the police.
Officials say that the student with his eyes tied and a 30-pound backpack with sand was pushed several times while he was trying to reach the goal by walking across the slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psy brothers did not call at 911 when Deng lost his consciousness and waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, and they were told to the police.
They, however, found time to change Denga's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Menga, national president of the brotherhood, to ask the council, as Chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"The fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Denga," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to save, and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng has received several blunt head injuries, torso and thighs.
“Often families have suffered as a result of fraternity ceremonial rituals, as at least one student dies every year, starting in 1970,” said Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step by the authorities.
Monroe jury counties tended to be accused of killing the third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against newcomers and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this formally or informally, then also,” Wagner stated at the press conference on Tuesday.
College Baruch banned the fraternity, and the nationwide brotherhood expelled the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will collapse, bond returns will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to go before it's coming, and how long it's going to last.
Economic history has little to say about time.
The recession entered only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for 86 months.
The harshness of the Federal Reserve in lifting rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The U.S. Central Bank administration therefore stresses so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise rates, but on how much adaptation will take.
Actually, there's a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that the whole fusion around higher rates is overstated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve with the coming global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the era of cheap money,” said Julian Jesop, the chief specialist in the international economy in capital economics, in his commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates to a more normal rate in the United States, but still low levels will be a seismic momentum, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Consider how some areas of the economy could react, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or around, waiting for increases of rates may lead to volatility for a while.
However, when the rate increases, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
“It is not like the revenue from shares to be halted by 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects the delay in coinary policy”, said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the increase in rates by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years is more likely to change dramatically, about 14 per cent towards rising rates, and remains fairly equal within 250 days thereafter (average growth of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal rate with an average income of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dol, the main trading specialist in Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more express at a rate increase immediately, and the revenue from shares begin to decline.
Recessions are the fact of economic life, but increases in rates often contribute to them.
In the present case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and could expedite the recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at its lowest point during the lifetime of an elevated rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, the increase in rates since 1950 was only twice the nominal annual GDP below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is long, while in the third quarter it is only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates on such a fragile economic background could be risky and posed a “whether this would be different” question, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing for an increase in the rates of the Federal Reserve System all year, with their view being drawn to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy and economists believe that FOMC could approve increases in the rates at the meeting, fucher trade only suggests a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study, since 1950, all the rate increase cycles to this day have been in the supercyclical of the increasing financial leverage at GDP, which overlaps the pics pre-evaluating the recession very quickly after the start of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest one that the Federal Reserve system has waited since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, which lasts 74 months and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one being implemented for shares.
The difference in principle is that bonds will have more effect than shares when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income appears to change the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the bond escalation cycle, Deutsche reports:
The Charles Schwab strategy specialists believe that increases in rates will lead to a closer increase in long-term and short-term bond income levels, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds are often better off in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says the study of Cathi Jones, a fixed income analysis in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System's policy.
“In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall of inflationary expectations, there are signs that the market has evolved into a more stringent coin policy,” she wrote.
The short-term interest rates have risen, the revenue curve is more flat, the credit span has widened, the volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market, while the federal system ' s policies are tightening.
Generally speaking, major business companies in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International debt companies will find themselves in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their production more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"Story shows that "quality" shares show efficiency above the market within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the customer report.
The firms with a stable financial condition were the companies with unstable status resulting from each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income capital companies as well as low-volatile shares have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
The debt will become a big question.
High-percent debt companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
Contributors could also see profits because of higher returns, although experts differ in how fast this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 - copy Classic FM” - approves a member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham criticized the station for “Decrease of Standards”
It proves that it is becoming less different from a commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just sodren with Brits.
Damien Collins, Parliamentary Collins, attacked the Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is transformed into Classic FM," said the parliamentary leader, inviting the TV to prove that she's doing anything that business companies do not do.
A member of Parliament from the conservatives, Andrew Bingham also stated to BBC leadership that it seems that the public radio station is silly and is becoming less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to be -- I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards award launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that you're the first to come to my mind in which you're actually just copying what you're already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial rival when it concerned living music and the education of the audience.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anywhere else.
And his loyalty to live speeches and the creation of music will not really be compared to anyone else.
"So really important, I think, is the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and advancing new works," he said.
Previously this year, Radio BBC manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past because British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC, who was attacked by commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of the Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice -- a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
You see why this programme is often discussed because of the lack of originality and characteristics?
Lord Hall argues that BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Fait and Boy George participate as judges, was done in the “typical BBC style”.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to have that "hat found in her own home studio" next time she starts a fun project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new seasons of the Voice in the future or to use the money of those who pay the licence fees to other entertainment formats.
The growth of the Internet sales has slowed as fast as possible in August, and it may be Black Friday.
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7 per cent increase in online sales
The past month has seen the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales were intensified three years ago by the use of mobile hepping devices
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could help to deter costs
For about ten years, a virtual shopping has been experiencing a boom, transforming many central streets into urban ghosts in Britain.
However, experts say that there are now signs of equivalence in online sales, after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase during the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online chopping in August showed a minimum increase since they began to be recorded in 2000, only by 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of equivalence in online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that the online sales had been intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were given the opportunity to buy online, and they could do so under any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it comes to the plato, and you can see the declining (growth).
The Black Pentecost phenomena, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing down of sales.
Experts believe that buyers were able to refrain from buying on the eve of the event that took place in the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers five times the average rushed to computers to make good use of the offers, thereby destroying a number of sellers ' websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers enter the present battle for profitable purchases, could cause people to refrain from spining
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pounds of sterlings out of every 5 are spent online.
With regard to goods such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online are more willing to buy than in fashion shops in central streets.
Musulmanes guard the deaths of the crane in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family have been sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Binladin Group partly blamed Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also traumatized after the crane was damaged
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world leaped on the streets to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the tap attack on the main mosque of Mecca.
Those dressed mainly in white, the burial enclosed a carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the al-Moaisem cemetery.
The grim procession passed by a sacred place, where, in just a few days earlier, the building crane struck the mosque ceilings and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for funeral, and at the same time the King of Saudis fined a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
Bodies 29 perished when the tap in the main mosque was collapsed
Among the deaths were the father of Casim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage tour when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the main mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group was not supposed to leave a tap shot lifted with a non-working tap.
The Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency states that Binladin Group is partially guilty of the insult.
The English news agency edition did not describe this detail but reported that company leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane at the chief mosque's yard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims leaped to go to hajj this month.
The Binladin Group did not make any statements about the tap damage, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inappropriate harmonization with the Meteorological Service.
Tens of crowns surrounded the Mecca Mosque, as part of the extensive construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been among the closest Saudi ruled family for decades and has run the largest construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al-Qaida Usama bin Laden was a change-born son whose family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident took place during the strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in the life of every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rial (about £174,000) to the relatives of the dead and the same amount to be irreversible.
The survivors will receive half that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money.
According to Veronica Laurie, British are increasingly hiring repair professionals
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - Opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q compartments stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief U.S. correspondent Daily Mail
It is said that the British lay hammers and paint brushes and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do house work
If you're able to treat a hammer or paint a wall, it seems that you're in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner of BQ, British are all more likely to hire master professionals to do easy homework.
Veronique Laurie, the new Kingfisher General Director, who owns a house service network, reported that this trend is followed by a significant influx of skilled masters from Eastern Europe offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master's goods and at the same time close 60 B&Q compartments stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shop staff, since eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by representatives of the weak sex.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends that were characterized by the growing number of single-women households that were more engaged in housing than in the past were not noticeable.
Ms. Laurie said, "Our shops still work predominantly by men.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the products obtained are taken by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women in the leadership of leading British companies whose shares are recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by reaching the equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director General and the Financial Director.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a deliberate decision, diversification was an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women for the board of directors.
After the group took the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, owned by Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision at the rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world observes a meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discusses the most important decision for two days - to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade.
A survey of 80 economists conducted by Reuters revealed that a little over half of those who thought last week that the Federal Reserve would do so now believe that it would still delay and maintain the rate at the current range of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve downstairs to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching that the principal bank can move from zero to start the normalization of interest rates”, said Angel Ubide, leader of the Institute of International Economics of Peterson.
The US economy works effectively, the economic recovery adds trillion dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that we should prepare for changes, but everyone said they were confident that all the chances were against that step.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
New Balkan route: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!", hundreds of refugees are scanned at the Horgosh checkpoint at the Serbian-Hungarian border.
From Tuesday Budapest closed the border for displaced persons.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to search for other versions of the European Union routes.
One of them, along the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shidu on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior of Neboshe Stepanović assures that his country is doing everything depending on it to help refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's already a pan-European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, no country in Europe alone can do so, and especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is steadfast:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he must complete the documents required for that purpose.
And if he doesn't, he'll never be let go to our country because he's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already raised a 175-tilinerometer fence at the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he plans to bring the same barrier to the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
"Europe wants to help us."
The evangelist Meimarakis has for several years been part of law-enforcement governments, which left the country to face a financial crisis.
Now he, as the temporary leader of the New Democracy party, is challenged by Cypras.
A few days before the elections, he met a journalist, Euronoyus.
Mr. Meyarakis, welcome to Euronoyus!
Thank you for your invitation.
EURONUZ: Nine months ago your party suffered a crushing defeat by retreating the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to surveys, New Democracy was comparable to that of popularity.
What has changed during that time?
We've changed Greece, and we too.
Mr. Cipris lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had proficiency in the budget and prospects for economic growth.
The country now has again a fiscal deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors have gone because Mr. Cipras has driven them away.
Over the past nine months, Greeks have had an opportunity to assess the situation in January and the false promises of Mr. Cipris.
And now they can easily compare what they have promised to what actually happened.
The daily life has become worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with most Greek citizens.
Euronius: But you say that in the event of election victory, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
The point is, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, the political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme on which they agreed without refusing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I strongly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronous: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr. Cipris and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new premiere on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least partly?
We actually voted for Greece's movement on the European road, because we're well represented by the devastating consequences of the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Europe now helps us by subsidizing our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Yunker package and banking assistance.
All of this would have been lost if there were no European contract.
But the current measures of rigid savings have been the result of Mr. Cypras conducting negotiations.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to be ordered, operates rationally, and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of bringing the recession back to the negotiations, but only after a certain period of time.
It would be incorrect to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to benefit from the benefits of EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Cypras did not provide any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have clarified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farm income.
We explained to our European partners that it was not a fixed monthly income, and he could not be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Cypras had never talked about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and not well informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you'll be at a table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Mrs. Mercel, and other European leaders.
Will you be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Evangelist Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014 we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by circulating its sharp corners.
We have made progress in reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that the Greek government had set up.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations outside.
And we have been able to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process were not interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronous: In the last weeks, there has been a massive flow of refugees in Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and the reactions of the European countries to which these people are seeking?
The crisis with the refugees is a bomb of slow action that we have to deal with after we have won the elections.
The reason is that the SYRIZ Government has not acted in this situation as it should have been.
Such matters should be kept ahead, for if the problem exists, emergency measures remain.
And we are in that situation now.
Even the interim government that changed SIRIZ has done more in just seven days than Mr. Cipris did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions by the interim Government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will be able to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that took place with them.
This issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will adhere to the position that European policies should adopt in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU Summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU to address this pressing problem.
Mr. Meyarakis, thank you for the interviews.
Thank you.
In the peace town of Dracovka Donetska, for a day, criminal investigation officers of the General Police Department, together with military counter-treaters, established and detained a suspect who had been 34-year-old Ukrainian military personnel from the city of Crevy Rog (Dnepropetrov), who had been shot out of the gun in his opponents on the night before.
A report of the wounding of a 22-year-old boy came from a hospital where he was hospitalized with cross-cutting firing wounds of his legs.

A man who opened a shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology
Following the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning -- and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day -- Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was “regretting” on the first murder and would like to “return everything back” on Tuesday.
The police in Gothya, Mississippi, reported that the professor of geography and social science at the University of Delta, called on the service of 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the manager that the police needed to send people to his home.
He said, "Yesterday night I killed my wife," and he also mentioned that there's a "stroke" in the house that's "no one touched," but probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
The Lamb did not explain why he opened the shooting.
When the police arrived at the crime scene, they found Amy Prentiss' body, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I wish I could bring it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and on Monday night, when he was surrounded by the police, killed himself.
Rector of the University, William Laforge, reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something in mind."
Despite the information on Monday that Lamb envisaged the novel between Prentis and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
Printis was referred to as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported that he was married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prentis had a daughter, 19, and she was "uncomfortable."
He added that Prentis and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Noulz, who the San Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentis, the last one worked from home on the Internet.
Noulz told me that Prentis had a hunting dog called Laitning, and she met Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, "She's always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the relatives on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same night the police found him on a "1" highway near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a PhD in the University of Delta.
Stars Lost Their Happiness
The acter (to the left) and his son Redmond (on the right) have survived several difficult years.
In 2001 he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his life companion, Farr Foset, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reportedly suffering from drug addiction and was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
This has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United for a few months because of a double break.
Luke Shaw broke his right foot in two places during the Champion League match where Manchester United lost PSV in Einkhoven.
While the defender is concerned about this subject, because of which he will not be able to go out in the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
A trauma occurred during the unreasonable subcategory of Hector Moron for the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw entered the PSV fine.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before taking to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or afternoon later and then operated.
It's awful -- a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overtaken a lot of difficulties and started playing fantasticly, and here it happened.
There was a oxygen mask on it.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
Morono's lucky he didn't get a red card and no toolbars were assigned.
Arbitr Nicolas Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
So judge yourself when I say it's a toolbar and a red card.
It was a very bad cushion from two legs.
In his Twitter, Shaw writes, "Thanks all for your messages, don't say how I'm devastated, my way to recovery starts, I'll come back stronger than I was."
On the other hand: Manchester United is in trouble with Luke Shaw when the PSV game is hit
The British defender will have an additional incentive to adjust to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, PSV coach, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any player gets out of that kind of trauma, everybody's really upset about it.
It was never our players' intention to traumatize an enemy.
Morono carried a breakthrough when playing for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gal at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's very hard now because he didn't intend to hurt an enemy, and when you hear it's a very heavy trauma, you feel bad," said Koku.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he touched him, but I didn't see a crack under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Morono, he said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure it.
I'm very hard, and I'm sorry.
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about "Loraks"?
Every parent is very quick to learn one thing: If your child likes a book, it's gonna take a little while before you know it almost naively.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to the question of the representative of a child resting company in the holidays of his beloved child book, the Prime Minister chose “Lorax”, a ecological story written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, and Cameron wrote in a comment on the SuperCamps website, and he continues, "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message, I love to read to my children because it always reveals any image or message that we miss."
And it's good, except the last paragraph where Cameron is supposed to reproduce the content of the book, but actually tells the story of a single-named film taken in 2012, with new characters and details added to make a rather brief original narrative.
"In the high walls of the city of All-Numberville, where there was no green and even air was sold for money, the boy, Ted, hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of their dream, by fulfilling her desire to see the present tree," we read in the text a description of the love story, the unknown Dr. Suzé (the real name of Theodore Suzel), who died in 1991.
If this is not very suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the "Lorax film" on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high walls of the city of All-Numberville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of their dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, as a generally recognized active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which the unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by the greedy cutter of trees and the perpetrator of the "communication" Nakins, despite the protests of Loracs (whose name is called the book), is a funny creature with a mouth who speaks "on the name of the trees."
Likely, such a simple PR challenge was entrusted to the author who never read a book about Loracs 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from the Cameron office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from the headquarters of Cameron, but no further comments had been received.
For Adam Lita there was obviously a risk of not getting into the assembly of England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenging task, but if you look at the collection that England has selected for this tour, the repetition of the 3-0 test series, which has occurred last time, does not seem likely to me.
I would not have ruled out the victory in my field either.
Alister Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players, virulently taking twisted balls, and collective thinking very much; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only young people's position.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bulwark that gives a twisted ball, and Adil Rashid, even if it's an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Still on the subject: Adam Lit left England's collection cricket and replaced by Alex Hayles.
The deletion of Adam Lite to me, his main coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyse.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality that the cries were evaluated by the judges.
There was no question about John Ruth, for example, what led to this announcement, because (and I said this earlier) players are best chosen themselves.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there'll be another opportunity.
The master coach in England, Trevor Baylis, spoke well about his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that's not surprising to me; he's first of all a commander and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take, before the betsman of the test cricket leaves the impression, a complicated question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play his or her field.
The only thing you could say is that England chose Jonathan Trottt for the Caribbean Prize League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
It's Alex Hayles, and he's a betsman, who I'm highly esteemed.
He's an unpredictable cricketist, that we saw at the Yorkshire Club early in this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge Square, which was something already.
It must be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
The thought of putting Moena next to Cook as an opening betsman, which would allow for an additional backer, keeping four fast-speed bulers, to be thought about, and I'm not opposed to it at all.
I don't see the reasons why the beating player can't beat the ball there, and the left-hand man has already shown him to be a damn good cricketist.
Mons may not be exactly what is needed for his County Woostershire, but he became their third number, and there's no difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches "Three Bethsman" before he came out as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes in as a reservoir, and in my brief association with him, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- on average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball -- and think that it's a risk rate, but among spinners voting for a little, and selecting youth.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
In addition to the prefabricated, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coach.
The appointment of Mahela Jayaouordin, Sri Lankan Bethsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a workshop.
He's one of the best guys for the game that will bring about the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games in which the white ball is used and will provide both energy and merciless pace.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether game or coach work, and like Mahela, he has much intelligence.
At times, new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has been said before, can add new force to the team.
The Colly College of Darem Ben Stowx is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, do not have any problems about it.
Although not all will agree, coaches and players do not determine the schedule.
And you should remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to take.
The British Entrance Camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
The unthinkable policy of David Cameron to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking at the selection of genius Jeremy-"It is yes or not?" - Corbin's leader of the Laborists or TUC abhorrence over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on days that, in the situation in which the EU is now facing a variety of crises - not all of them of their own manufacture - some of the countries that are participant in the wing of the British egocentric agenda of sowing concessions and subversive arrangements of changes that they do not mostly want.
When TUC was meeting at Brighton for an annual meeting, he decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the Dave and George selphi program."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are катаing themselves on summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves in the background of a known local monument, in or without local celebrity, then coming home and saying that they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to maintain external contact with Britain under the tent of the European Union, "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, suggests that the embarrassed ministers and officials in some capitals should reach an understanding when they are going to be, stay or leave.
Angel Mercel, a very cautious Chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before the situation for her deteriorates, as it has deteriorated for those in Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cola (16).
François Ollland, head of France, stands before overelection or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland can soon obtain a nationalistic right-wing government, Spain left-hand government.
It is hard to see them out of the skin to help the Self-Britas whose energy could be spent to prevent Scotland from leaving the British -- which they also do not want, because most of them have similar separatist trends.
So some such ministers may even plan to produce deliberately useless SNP-style receptacles during the British referendum campaign in 2017, in order to move the British out of the EU, my friend implies.
“The review was an idea-fix” and “Britia received nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations”.
Europeans are aware of the predator of the Flit Street, and as skeptical to the EU, the media magnates are set up, unlike the Tony Benn's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by the ratio 2:1.
They may frankly remember Boris Johnson, a rooted Euro-opportunist who was known by his “direct bananas of the EU” by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a hot company from frightening joggers, telephone hackers and non-resident pseudo-non-residents who own most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he was aware that when you're in a bumpy gorilla cell, you have to give her the bananas to take her away and not let her eat you lunch and tea again.
Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in opposition to the idea of a referendum by Cameron, since Blar had taken the lead in favour of the revocation of the EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But the lovely Jeremy Corbin, who had bent me on my back in Westminster on Monday, I told him he had no more time to spend it on me, looks like he's at risk of repeating the Nile Kinnok strategy "Bycott Murdoku" of the '80s" is a mistake and then, and now.
It might take a while, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for interaction with the press -- not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the BBC he was sitting on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend, Ukip, and the wider range of the small England sides among the Tori may say yes.
It's the same thing as Hilari-"Benn, but not bannit"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his inner boy scout refused to admit that Corbin was a bad idea as John McDonnel's "thene" as the Minister of Finance.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his old father was fighting hard on TV for being unfaithful to Liborian colleagues without going too far or losing his office in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any circumstance” -- Benna's phrase -- is not what McDonnel said, and not what J. K. spoke to the parms and members of Parliament at the private meeting on Monday night, in general opinion.
In order to tell the Democrat and his boyfriend Corbin -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the century of 24-hour television seven days a week, especially in the waters of social networks, paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron separate himself from Europe, allowing him to accept as a proper support for leiborists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main misleading of McDonnel and Corbin on EU membership - within the Benni economy of deposition - is no longer the issue of esotheric debate among left dissidents, for which narcissism, born of minor differences, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his errors over Nato - Tom Watson, it is unwavering that J.K. will not be agitated for his exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British concessions when it can be meaningless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government has been cutting costs, which I was reminded of on Monday during the lunch at a British Influence Security forum.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from public health in England
Statements by the Government-funded agency that electronic cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were made at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom are related to tobacco, according to researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report last month, called it "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the validity of the data and indicated the link between some experts and tobacco industry.
The drafting article in Lancet Medical Journal last month criticized the “extraordinarily grim argument” on the basis of which PHE constructed its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers wondered whether these statements had “solid or fumble grounds”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Caipwell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The Fundamental Principles of Health - Rules must be based on evidence of efficiency”.
According to them, the public expects PHE statements that “the best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoke” were based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this emerges from the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criterial decision-making model to summarize their views on the harm caused by the various nicotino-positive products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McKi and Capwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwis Health, whose Director-General reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the electronic cigarette producer, without mentioning the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There were no reasonable explanations for the election of board members, but some of them included some well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also stated the financing of the industry in publications.
We do not know whether other participants have the experience of tobacco management.
The PHE tobacco leader also visited the meeting.
The scientific article published by the group “extremely agrees” that there is a lack of “real evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria” by McKi and Caipwell.
However, none of these links and limitations have been affected in the PHE report.
McKy and Caipwell reported that PHE statements that “there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smoking” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of PHE health and well-being, said that the BMJ statements had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died all his life because of their addiction.
All evidence implies that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and what does not prove these evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative risk of tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die of smoking-related diseases, while smoking costs $2 billion a year.
Clearly denoting that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the damage caused by smoking, we are carrying out our tasks to the nation.
The former chapter of Channel 4 believes BBC should end the EastEnders series.
The former chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have given a lot for such successful show as the soap opera of Albert's "Porace."
Johnson noted that licence fees should be used only to create programmes that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are likely only a small part of the audience, at a peak ether time when competitors have high rating shows, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he, in his time for six years, failed to cooperate with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
"I can't separate myself from the thought that BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting transfers that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords as part of the further study of BBC's fate.
If you keep a licence charge that I don't think is a good decision in the medium and long term, companies should leave the air only those programs that are not released and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice shows up in the air, because the creators want as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one shows him again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be financed by gears that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels would certainly have been much for her.
I don't understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would humiliate BBC.
The Serial Entrepreneur Johnson, headed by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of ratings because of staff ambitions and their belief that it is the best way to obtain long-term support.
His comments on the most popular BBC show are summed up with comments by the executive director Sky Tony Bol, who, in his 2003 lecture of McTaggart's memory in Edinburgh, offered BBC to sell an EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that the more niggardial BBC transfers of a public character are "to continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but then the company's function has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Jange sermons justifying the proceeds of licensing charges of 4 billion pounds: "but, of course, we are doing all these imprecise transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
With regard to Johnson's licence collection, he said to the committee: “I call on you to find a more regressive system for who would receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people with 150 pounds of money, I wonder, because they don't really look and listen to BBC.
The former Sky and Channel Executive Director 5 David Elstine, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of “inform, educate and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small portion of BBC material is now formally classified as educational -- he said that it was 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent on radio -- and that the company should support the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto “inform, educate and entertainment”.
On the issue of partnership, Elstane noted that BBC should make more efforts in areas such as “Standard Concerts” (only part of them appears on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how intacts change the direction when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nerve system that can be manipulated through sound waves.
Low intodes change the direction of movement at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses are influenced by activated neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
On the other hand: Researchers manage brain activities by light
Scientists said that worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called sonogenetics, which is the use of ultrasound to initiate certain brains, hearts and muscles, and the source of ultrasound is out of the body.
Szrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could once replace deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent into the brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Nobody's worms usually don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to react when they were placed in liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles increase ultrasound waves that then penetrate worms.
Intensified ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4's "ion channels", found in membranes of some worm cells.
The ultrasound waves make these ion channels open and incited cells that are connected to them, reports the Nature Communications report.
To create a nematod that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so their engine neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, the sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and entered into worms by activated modified engine neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in "optogenetic" - a new direction that enables scientists to include and switch neurons by light pulses.
Chalasani argues that there may be some advantages in relation to this method of homogeneticism.
Unlike the light, which reaches the right section of the brain, low - frequency ultrasound waves pass unhinderedly through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to go inside the skull.
“We believe that the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will enable human neurons to be sensitive to ultrasound signals for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical conditions,” said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin producer cells.

Advertising attacks on the British arms trade
See the role of Amnesty International in protesting the exhibition of armaments.
Awesome killer drones!
Destroying naked iron candals!
Cassette bombs!
Electrical light tumors causing pain, but not leaving traces!
The sound voice and painted animation leave no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international weapon exhibition is an elusive parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to push out weapons to reprisal regimes, using the ExCeL centre in Doklands of defence technology and security systems.
On the other hand: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes travel to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden arrival of a number of posters on bus stops and on trains of the subway that require a re-examination of them.
"The important DLR announcement from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of these in the London subway with a DLR line converting into a tank valuation.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on line DLR. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who put their jobs in the "Music of Savage Design" in the Banky Park of Dismaland.
A group called “Specific Patrol” has helped to distribute them to London, using the “defendant of advertising sites”, a 6-pound set of hot keys, which is said to “have access to about a third of the advertising space at the bus stations of the planet.”
London transporters were fainted with such “wandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the “Special Patrol” Unit.
According to Gavin Greendon, Cruel Designs and a teacher at the University of Essex, artists become more demanding and seek to bring political art to the audience outside the galleys.
Many artists start working with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for their arts if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of arms welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the VCCP pro bono agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and an artist of sound, also working free of charge.
The Creative Director of VCCP Matt Lever was amazed at the advertising silence around the exhibition of arms - with an exCel calendar - and thought, "Let's get them into a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and crafty corporate advertising, but "to fill her home with bright colors and animations was more exciting."
"They helped us incredibly to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and to ensure that these drinking equipment will not be illegally sold right at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art of arms exhibition comes from the ExCeL, where participants trade fantasticly euthemetic products.
The Saab press release revealed the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shots" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “no equivalent of a cumulative warhead that produces an unprecedented blast inward.”
Whatever he does, it won't be nice.
Eight golden rules of residence in student dolls
It's been 11 years since I moved to a schoolmate as a normal 19-year-old person who still believes in taking and moral relativism, but just now I remember the strained smiles of those I've been irritating -- and many long, complaints against others.
Basically, what I learned is eight simple rules.
Moves to the liver may vary from slightly operating on the nerve to completely frightening.
He's trying to talk to people from where you took a academic leave and where you spent it, whether you're supporting Corbin and why you're "fairly, I don't like or hate Marmaith," because, seriously, it's just the trembling trait of HAHAHA, I'll be with myself."
You need to get some rest.
And help others break up, too, ask questions and show interest.
It keeps your conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those you don't even talk to, even if you'd have a whisker, and they'd give you fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often transformed into food institutions, monthly cinemas and common rooms, but they are also the place where people dress and refurbish the underwear.
On the other hand: Don't even think about starting a university in a relationship
Introverts in universities are unjust.
Your room has to be a haven, but many dormants form a culture of tenancy from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and long-standing friendships.
It could be hell for someone who tries to rebuild power.
There's nothing in culture that lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to rebuild the energy that I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when the coach is tired by communication, and not knocking on it, but sending the SMS.
By the way, about the knocking: do it.
One guy in my domicile followed this principle: If the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with a baking.
Since you start a university life at the peak of the popularity of Bake-Off show, you start knocking on the door to present and present a dish of chocolate cookies, not that strange action, no longer the 1950s, "Welcome, We're Neighbors, I've got something to say to you, and now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions."
It's a good way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and eventually your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you're a baker.
Bloody meds, sugar, and fat will make people look sleeping when you knock on them.
The thievery of food is a typical crime in student dolls.
Of course, kidnapping someone's chicken is a thief, but is it a thief to take a little milk for tea?
Get out of the milk owner.
He's probably going to invite you not to be shy, even if the inside boils out of rage.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and I'm sorry to you, but try to treat it more than my neighbor who poured in her milk liquid to wash the dishes to vengeance those who took it without demand.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noises that prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people about glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbor to remove the sound of drums and bas guitars, because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an examination this morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she mercifully allowed him to sleep for two hours and then cut her music and locked the door behind her by going to three hours' exam.
Would it not be romantic if your future mate had settled in the same company as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, before you bite the elbows, uncomfortable if you were to take a neighbor for your future spouse, take care of him, break his relationship, and see him every day, and maybe see how he's stretching all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell the heart, but if the hot neighbor is not exactly your future spouse, try to cool your own dust a little.
At the fascinating moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between the playground and the grass is thiner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite in seconds.
Prepare a valuable and interesting lesson on safety, hiding something, but never pack someone's toothpaste room and champagne.
In front of a strange door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll then put in a ice cream -- but don't stick other things with a Blu-Tack clue to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after an update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings application, select General and then by Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error report appears saying to them that “the application has failed to update”.
To avoid this, users are encouraged either to wait until the recovery is halted or to try to update through iTunes.
Telephone tips will allow you to go through the process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the space - but Apple minimized the probability of this operation by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the implementation by a special tool which proposes to remove the annexes and reinstall them after the process has been completed.
It is important to make sure that when you update your phone is loaded or is next to the charge device to prevent the battery from unloading.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because the phone's cut-off in the process can lead to a failure to update.
Read further: iOS 9 comes out of the plan, despite the delay of the WatchOS Review of IOS 9: the least impressive and better update of iOS 9: how to prepare for the new operating system for iPhone
You need to make sure that you have seen our checklist of actions that need to be done before downloading to try and make something stop wrong, and to protect yourself from this, if that's not the case. IOS 9 now includes new functions, including improved personal assistant, and innovations that increase the productivity of iPad, as well as adjustments that increase speed and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support Moscow has provided to President Asaad only leads to an aggravation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House isn't going to talk to a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported in PJ Media.
“The secretary of Carrie made it clear that the further support of President Asad from Russia poses the risk of aggravating and extending the conflict, and also has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on the search for solutions to the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power,” said the U.S. Head of State.
They also noted that Kerry had once again stressed the United States commitment to combating the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Asaad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in trying to resist the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, the representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian troops were doing in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
Joss Ernest, Spokesman for the White House, noted that the time for telephone conversation between President Barak Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, had not yet come: “When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the tube and try to make the call.”
Barak Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for Asad's regime as a “gambling rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that further support for Asaad would only worsen the situation.
“But he did not listen to my warnings — and as a result, the situation deteriorated,” said the U.S. President.
The imported yachts will free the payment of customs duties.
Minor economic development intends to temporarily free the imported yachts and other floating funds for recreation and sports from payment of customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the FM.
Elena Laskin, Assistant Minister for Economic Development, reported on this.
In June 2015, Prime Minister F. Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Krym, commissioned a number of departments - Mineconomy, Mintrans RF, Minculture, MID, MSC, FSB, FTC, Rostourism - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for yachting in the country's coastal zones.
In turn, experts point out that the complete lack of the yacht storage, maintenance and maintenance infrastructure is a major problem.
The owners prefer to keep their ships abroad - some 200 million € per year go to European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of the yacht.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision by the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission for Europe on the modification of the list of goods temporarily imported with full exemption from customs duties, taxes, providing for full conditional exemptions from customs duties, taxes for imported boats and other floating recreation and sports.
In the view of the Ministry, this would undoubtedly contribute to creating an enabling environment for the development of Yachting in the country's coastal zones, noted Laschina.
This issue was presented to the Subcommission on Customs, Non-tariff Management, Protection in Foreign Trade of the Government's Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and was also endorsed by the departments as a result of the discussion.
As the representative of Min Economy noted, the proposed measure for full conditional release on importation is essentially a concession.
Therefore, after the adoption of the protocol, the subcommission ' s meeting in the Government of the Russian Federation will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for Discussion with the EEA member States, explained to Laskin.
The list of importable goods that are totally exempted from payment of customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc.: service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), test equipment, drilling equipment, stage suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, music instruments and objects for religious rituals.
In the Mintrans R.F.Evvetiam press service, it was reported that mandatory regulations had been prepared for seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodocia and Euratoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the process of setting and exit of small, sporting sailing and walking vessels to the seaport.
The Mintrans are entrusted to the captains of the Krym seaports to ensure that small, sports sailing and abnormal ships are simplified in the seaport and that the vessels listed from the seaport are shipped.
Mintrans also prepared draft government orders to approve the borders of the Krima seaports.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the process of harmonization, noted in the press service of the department.
In the opinion of Mintrans, the State Inspector, Classification and Inspection, the Republic of Krym and Sevastopol should exercise the registration of small vessels used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is in Russia is that it's because of poorly developed infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, it is a continuously developing industry that involves a large number of people.
In Russia, however, everything is on the ground.
Our coast is small, the only piece where the yachts can be exploited round-the-clock is the Black Sea in the Sochi, Helenjik, Novosiski, Anapa.
But the greatest challenge is that in this area, the strict rules of the border service are strict: to get out on the boat, the mass of permits needs to be issued.
Besides, in Russia there's nowhere to get rid of the yacht.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then she has a problem where to get it, says the Nordmarine Denis Novikov sales director.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special yacht hangars in Moscow and St. Petersburg up to 30 metres. Yachts are also deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yacht fell.
The World Bank has provided Ukrainian loans of $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project of $500 million for Ukraine for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of an international organization.
“New funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the report states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help reintroduce credits in a real economy and would stimulate recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank had witnessed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of Fan's problems, the Government of Ukraine is calling for an acceleration of reforms.
Previously, the Polish Government approved the loan in Ukrainian €100 million, transmitting the RIA Newsty.
In prisons, they are asked to establish separate units for transgender.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Prison Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of establishing separate blocs for transgenders and transvestites in colonies.
The Vladislav Grib, a member of the Council, told about this.
In his view, depending on the total number of non-sex prisoners in Russia, it was possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many) for transgenders to a special colony.
However, Vladislav Grib stresses that it is possible to determine whether citizens will be sentenced to such isolated places only after the convicted persons have taken appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the remaining sentences.
He said that the practice offered was successful abroad: SIDS (where the accused were pending a court decision) provided separate cells for transgender and special units in correctional facilities.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
Unequivocally, they must be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in conventional cells is dangerous to them, which is the suffering of their families and the sea of problems for FSIN staff.
Commercial humiliations are guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of a large city, the number of offenders with an uncertain gender must be calculated and the location to be distributed.
SIZOs don't exactly need separate -- just cells, prison blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgenders.
According to the Grib, 50 or 100 persons may be in the block, and if a specialized body is established in Russia alone, transgender prisoners will be able to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held in SIZO at the scene of the crime, so transvestites or transgenders from other actors are unrealistic in the course of the investigation and trial, and the introduction of such practices for already convicted persons in a separate colony, yes, is considered Gribe.
Recall that the law enforcement officials had not previously been able to decide which male or female masculine detention facility to identify a drug-sustained 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kowov (known as Alin Davis), which did not result in the arrest of a man with a girl's appearance.
He was released home under a subscription on non-departure.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, since there is no mechanism for transgender in SISO and in Russia's colonies.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT activist (LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nicolas Alexeyev supported the idea of setting special places to serve sentences by transgenders, noting that there is also possible definition of men or women in colonies, depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as is the security issue for homosexuals, says Alexeyev.
Prisons must be safe, so individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially as they are more in prison than transgender.
However, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to betray themselves for transcexuals in order to get to a different location from the usual colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be instituted before putting people in a transgender colony, but not always unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning’s prisoners looked like a man, and he said in prison that he wanted to change the sex, said Alexeiev.
A person may feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve penalties for transgenders, I doubt that prison officers will think seriously about the safety of such people and be aware of the indulgence of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the RF, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender persons in the colony could severely delay the commencement of sentences by convicted persons.
A commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, and it is not one test based on a high-quality conclusion.
Today's potential for psychiatry allows this to happen.
So before the change of sex, the potential patients are always doing this -- they're clearly showing whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system is being implemented in relation to convicted persons, for the average of the period is the month.
The doctor, although generally supported the idea of separate transgender blocks, also doubts that in the current economic environment it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical assessments, transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to count, no official statistics, but if you consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5 per cent, you can say that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have this rejection and yet commit crimes are a very small number, said Lord Kipanidze.
At the request of the administration of the colony, homosexuals and transgenders are now able to obtain certain conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipole won the Youth Championship of the World on Chess.
The chess chess championship ended in Hanta Manciusk until 20 years of age.
The end was more than an intriguing one.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became Russian Mikhail Antipole, who was able to mount the Jan-Kshistof Douda Polish, who was kind of confidently going to the title.
A Ukrainian chessman named Natala Bux was a winner.
The world chess chess champion, which had been held since early September in Hanta Mansiski, had seemed to have lost almost all of the intrigue at the middle of the tournament distance, since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kshistof Doud, who had a series of four wins (the Swiss system is held in 13 tours), had confidently captured leadership.
Given the fact that Douda was an rating characteristic of primaryity, yes, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chessists, the likelihood that he would miss the extracted gap was very small.
And even when Douda lost his turns and allowed the Russians, Michael Antypov, to reduce his backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the struggle for titles.
In fact, Antypo had to win the 13th tour to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win the Doud's party.
Plus this commitment of victory, of course, could have had an impact on the Russian chess game and led to necessitative mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipoch was able to avoid them.
He was confident of Francesco Rambaldi, and he was forced to wait for his party to finish the Doud meeting Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipov, the Polish chessist erected a nick against Dutch.
Thus, Antipole and Douda obtained an equal number of points, 10 out of 13 possible, but Antypov had better additional indicators.
It was therefore his leadership of the Hanta Mansia Autonomous District, whose Governor Natalia Komarov has traditionally paid great attention to the development of the chess in the region, and has given him a major prize.
There's no intriguing ending in the girls' competition.
The leader of the tournament, Natale Buxé (Ukraine), was not able to lose the title in the last tour that she had succeeded.
So the Russian victory of Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second with a championship of 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The company is united by the Vilgal and Ural regions in one of the large Walesco-Ural regions, Siberia and the Far East, to the East region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As Mikhail Slobdone, the Manufacturer Michail Slobdone noted, changes are being undertaken to “stand a strong player in the market”, to develop a company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In an interview with the “Russia 24”, Mr. Slobdone clarified that they intended to reduce the “ten percent” of the staff in Russia.
Speaking supervisor inspected 78 Moscow Burger Kings and issued 367 orders.
As a result, a restaurant in the Volocolama highway was fined by 50,000 roubles, and the Big Toule Street was closed 90 days, but resumed work after all violations were eliminated.
The 43 dining rooms violated the requirements of the premises.
Among other violations, the unsatisfactory sanitary and hygiene content of the premises, non-compliance with the ventilation requirements, and bacteria of the bacteria of the bowl group have been detected in some institutions.
Franchise on Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus, the owner of Alexander Kolobov's network, and 293 bitches work in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, FAS leader, stated that the department against indexing was 10 per cent of freight tariffs and the provision of hospitals, as requested by OAO.
First they wanted 17% of the index, now they want 10%, and they want multi-million-year budget subsidies, he says --
We're saying that it's wrong, it's too much, it's cut your costs, you're learning to save, you're not giving up expensive specialists, soccer teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its “more stricter” proposals, which were being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V., instead of performing a total $300 million post for shares, the gold extraction company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the Sumeru share price and market catalogues), which can be extracted from free cash flows.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement the option or to require extra payments.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations do not reveal.
The option was established as part of a Polymetal project called Kyzil in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing a sanction of the developers.

Guardin Kane's movie craftsmen will be put on the bidding.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History reported on plans to present black versions of the "Gardin Kane" film on trade, which is considered to be one of the best works of the director, scripter and actor Orson Wells.
The auction will begin in the town of Kalabas on 29 September, with three black versions of the script, each of which is estimated at $20-30,000, and AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevice, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second drafter is a more complete version of the script, and the third is the final plan of the film.
Mineral: targeted food aid will not be the same as cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Victor Eutugov, reported that the food aid programme would not be the same as the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the food card.
It would be particularly important to note that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the backlog of the total deficit, the distribution card system where the quantity of the products received was normal.
In the meantime, we have proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the law”, quoting Mr. Eutuchov's words by the TASS.
Previously, the U.S. reported that the programme for the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced to the Government.
For more information on the Minprobor initiative, see “Igor Schelav assigned to prepare food cards.”

President of the R.D. Alexander Bobresov withdrew from his post.
The Vice-President of OAO "Russian Railways" (RWD) for Corporate Security, Alexander Bobres leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-Primeer of Russia, chairman of the Board of Directors of the R.D.A.A.D. Parcković, stated that the issue of leaving the R.D. Alexander Bobresov had initiated a new head of Oleg Beloser.
According to the vice-premier, the relocation of staff in management of RJD is not related to the change of head of the company.
Previously, the U.S.A. reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin OAO, the first transport paternity minister was headed by Oleg Beloser, who smoked the financial bloc.
For the first time, the new head of the company announced reforms in a monopoly: a new freight tariff system would be established in one and a half years.
For more details on the transformation of the company, see the U.S.P.P.
This year, a study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top-1000 Russian Managers" was released in the 16th.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian officials for a year by identifying leaders in the industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the ranking laureates last year.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for this year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the original list offers up to 10 new managers from other companies who would be useful to add candidates to the general pool.
The following functional directors of the company may be made available: financial director, business director, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Government, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert offers an invitation to the manager to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to present his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nominations of industry-based candidates are based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forest-processing industry, machinery, mediobis, metallurgy, multidisciplinary Holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and consumer goods production, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant shall be provided with log and password for login at www.top1000.amr.ru, where they will see information on the remaining participants and may submit their assessments to the criteria proposed for each functional orientation.
The rating methodology is based on the principle “Better choose the best”: top managers evaluate top managers, and functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle provides the maximum authenticity of the professional reputation of colleagues.
Final results of the rating are approved at expert commissions meetings.
Eyewitness meetings of expert commissions are invited to all eligible candidates for this year ' s rating and to many candidates for the rating of past years.
The Commissions shall be organized on a functional basis: a list of senior managers and eight functional guidance boards.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (locally maintained and closed until the rating is published) or to make the updates to the annexed list of standby candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the rules of the United Nations.
At the time of the publication, the status of managers and companies may be changed.
The investment rate is 10 to 13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the market for small and medium-sized business loans in January and April of this year has reached 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Since the panic of the end of 2014 to the beginning of 2015, IAS lending has declined considerably.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
25 to 30 per cent of the annual credit was not profitable to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to place all its potential problems in the future, from delays to non-refoulements, it was now impossible to do so: rates and so-called veils.
For business, the current level of IAS credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of payability.
The rate rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How do you estimate that entrepreneurs' demand for credit is met?
The situation has improved slightly after the CB's downsizing rate.
Loan resources have become more accessible.
However, our observations show that customers have become less credit-relevant.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future incomes.
Today, business has one solution: it is necessary to learn how to work to address the economic situation of the country and the region today.
The current results need to be monitored more closely, and the cash flows should be monitored.
However, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, ultimately, enables companies to make products more competitive and to preserve business even in a fragile economic situation.
What major trends in the IAS lending market will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The projection for lowering the average rate will depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the controller is now showing consistency in the issue of the downsizing of the key rate.
However, the radical fall in the price of the IUF is not worth waiting.
In the current situation, inflation is first of all a problem that makes the necessary interest rate for real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
In terms of procrastination, traditionally small- and medium-sized business companies, which are limited to both cash replenishment and economic behaviour options, will undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time difficult for those who have used to cyrillic or Latin.
And the new CX-5, like, and any other model of the stamp: without fancy attracted outside, technically perfected inside.
Japan's just because of its "Japonism" is able to lead the country of the rising sun to a state of complete enthusiasm.
You can argue as many times as you like in favour of cars from other countries, and even a person will agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will be dissolved from the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people may have to love not only technology but also everything else in Japan.
To quote Bassa from the turn of the way, to fix your food, to collect catans, and to dress your girlfriend -- no, not in kimono, of course, but in Japanese street fashion canons: solace, creatively and very unexpectedly.
Perhaps Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensible and tight.
And the girl's older, the skirt is shorter.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the grid of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But the new picture of the headlamps and the rear lamps, where the automobile is instantly detected in the stream of cars, is much more dramatic than the car’s face.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The force is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the outward appearance has a rigorous flow of rigidity.
We don't have to call the police.
With the CX-5 drive, one of the world's safest, only a stoic Japanese calm can be tested.
The diesel engine of 2.2 litres provides a high torque in the wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 litres is only 5.9 litres. A force aggregate is installed with exclusively automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
In order to add a little black humor to this image, you can select legends with a Not Cross police band.
In fact, Mazda made the best effort to keep you from being on the CX-5 track.
In order to improve the comfort, while maintaining good management, the tableers restructured the design of front and rear depreciators and optimized the form of the front lower levers.
The full transmission system is adapted under Russian conditions.
High speed noise levels are reduced by 13 per cent.
The bather's in flowers or stripes is as boring as the budget cedan.
It's different if a girl jams in a bathroom with an original figure.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space and for broad shoulders and for long legs who owns what.
The long - leged ones are likely to appreciate that the legs in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and not hit by ankles in the expressions.
The widest set of active security systems of Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to detect a potential threat.
There's adaptive lighting here, warning of strip descendants, monitoring of dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
The soft-minimum performance shall contain a load of 561 litres. The rear seats shall be in proportion to 4:2:4 - each section shall be fitted with a separate lever - and shall increase the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
Japan's cartoon hero's suit is called cigurums.
Particularly ashamed to look like pijama cigrums.
Everybody in it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it's also about entertaining young children.
Or just walking around like that street beast...
Because it's so great when you have the opportunity to choose -- fun dress, behavior, or car.
Thank you for helping prepare the Kawaicat store.
Kiev ripped the atomic nucleus.
Kyiv has formally formalized Ukraine ' s refusal to cooperate with Russia in the development of Hmelnicka AEC.
The Supreme Council voted on Wednesday, following the second attempt, for the dissolution of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the construction of the third and fourth clusters were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start the project.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law distributing the 2010-2012 agreement with the FM on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Hmelnice of the ECO.
The draft law introduced by the Government was possible only from the second ballot, the first time it was supported by 210 members, with a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament, in the process of re-election.
The Hmelnik ESA for the original project was to have four HBV energy blocks with WWR reactors but only two have been constructed.
Negotiations with Moscow had led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010, and in 2011-2012, the Council had enacted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that building blocks would have to be credited to the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup d ' état in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of the two Kyiv countries, relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry began to be reversed, pronouncing the refusal to cooperate with the Hmelnicka of the ESA and the construction project of the nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where the relationship has been maintained was the purchase of fuel in the RF for existing Ukrainian ES (provided about half of the generation of electricity in the country), since the Ukrainian NAEC “Energoat” was to replace Russian supplies with nothing in the meantime.
Hmelnicka ES with another contractor in Ukraine had not yet been relinquished until 2014, in Kiev, had announced negotiations with Czech Skoda JS.
UNHSG against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, during the press conference, said that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“No military solution”, AP gives his answer to the question of military support for Syria by Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the permanent members of the UNSR later this month.
"The meeting will be for Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Henstaba of the Armed Forces of Russia, Nikolai Bogdanovski reported that Henschab did not preclude the establishment of a future military base in Syria.
There's no such plans yet.
"But whatever may be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, the U.S. reported that the United States did not trust President Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to the official Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist grouping of the Islamic State.
For more information on the US doubts regarding Syria’s Russian aid, see “The Russian military presence in Syria is worrisome by Washington.”
OSCE reports on a possible meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) OSCE Arthur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
“What I know is that a meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, quotes Mr. Herasimov's words to the TASS.
He also called for the implementation of the mines agreements and “return to the normal lives of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the Normandian format or in the form of a contact group at the OSCE PA site, Mr. Gerasimov, noted that the dialogue was a mine agreement.
At the same time, policy has said that Kyiv supports any kind of dialogue.
Previously, the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Republics of Donetca and Lugan had not changed their positions in triangular negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given their mandates.
Yesterday, the Lower Novgorod Electoral Commission took stock of the elections in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputies on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral irregularities were voiced by CRCF representatives who had been accused of the election of “the oppression of falsifications”.
The opposition ' s observations have not been adopted.
At the same time, the Russian Communists refused the party to organize a referendum on the lifting of the multi-family back-up fees.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections in the proud Lower Novgorod in the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the lists of voters in Lower Novgorod, 746.7000 ballots were issued to the stationary commissions and 268,000 voters voted.
More than 11,7000 ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on their votes.
On the lists of the “Edie Russia”, six deputies in the hordes rely on Dmitry Sutkovsky, Dmitria Red, Vasili Schupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryev and Igor of Nagornom.
The only mandate of the LDDP was the leader of the party, Vladimir Zirinovski.
The two mandates of CRC are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and the Secretary-General of the Lord Alexander Tarnev.
The three mandates of the Justice Russia are available to Alexander Musumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shaluguin.
For five days now, these candidates must determine whether they will work as deputies in the city mind: if they renounce the mandate, they will move to the next party candidate.
The Chairman of the Horizborcom, Alexander Macayev, informed the members of the Commission that he had issued a statement on “referrals of television programmes to Girinovski and others” in order to waive mandates.
In adopting the electoral report, representatives of CRCR reported multiple violations.
A member of the Hybrid voter from CPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that the entry into the administration of the Sormov district had been closed under the order of the Head of Administration, where there were four district commissions.
Inwards, neither the Lord ' s deputies nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers, nor the resonance scandal with the raid of the door of the raid was displayed on the television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberate vote had the opportunity to attend.
They had ceased access only when the ballot had ended and the stationary commissions had not yet arrived to issue their ballots.
This has been done to prevent various provocations.
“The chapter was corrected and interested persons could be present at all meetings”, a member of the mountains was coupled with Natal Andruchin.
Communists objected that in the blocked administrative building over four hours, a deputy of the Zack of the Ludmil Aristitu District Assembly had been unlawfully held, for which a statement was made to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also dismayed that, in a number of URIs on the electoral day, they began to seal urines at 6 to 7 a.m. in advance ballots.
At the same time, no members of the commissions with the right of deliberate vote and observers have not been notified, so they have come to the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists are confident that the ballots could be thrown uncontrolled in the morning before the opening of the polling stations.
However, in a selection of more than 124 complaints on various grounds, Alexander Maceiev said that no violations had been found with the drop of the unaccounted ballots.
The members of the Commission and the proposal by their colleague from Maria Popova, through the scrutiny of the amendments to the regional legislation, to establish clearly the time for opening the envelopes with the ballots of the pre-term vote, which would then be in the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, turn to the CIC," advised Mrs. Pope Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of CRC, Sergei Samohin, who shouted that he ignored dozens of complaints and covered the falsifications in the elections, was attacked by the President.
"You're not here at the meeting, be careful!" -- the chairman was offended by the voter.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
Until 27 September, the election is to approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Lower Novgorod Urban Duma of the sixth meeting will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the Urban Electoral Commission denied the political party to the Communists of Russia to register the proactive group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were about to put two questions to the bottom of the towns: whether they agreed that the prizes for the ceremonies of multi-family houses should be “should be cancelled” and the tariffs for housing and communal services “for freeze until 2020”.
However, the lawyer of Irin Maslov explained that the application of the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx is mixed, reduction of projections by 2016.
FedEx reported on the unsatisfactory results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the annual income projection due to the fall in demand for goods and increased costs in its Ground Transport Unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire some 55,000 seasonal employees for holidays.
The same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were raised by about 2.5 per cent in pre-trade in 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he was planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year ending in the next May, which was 20 cents less than the previous projection.
The analysts were $10.84 under the FactSet review.
The projection is reduced despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in ground fees for heavy or sized heavy goods, which begins in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase profits compared to the past year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and the CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “had worked steadily in the light of the weakest, compared to the projection, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The employment plans for the holidays were announced the following day after a competitor ' s statement, the UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 staff, approximately as much as they had been employed last year.
FedEx earned 692 million dollars over the quarter ending August 31, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income was 2.42 dollars, close to an average of $2.44 per share by a 12 analyst survey of Zacks Investment Research.
The income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks analysts were $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by the downturn in the urgent international transport sector, which has resulted in a lack of gross income in its express transport unit.
But the online shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, land-based revenues increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income remained largely unchangeable due to increased costs of large departures and self-insurance.
The espress transport unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector income fell due to higher wage costs.
In the preliminary bids, about an hour before the FedEx stock exchange was opened, FedEx fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most anticipated meeting over a few years, the leaders of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding whether it is time for the first time to raise the key interest rate in almost ten years.
On one end, a well-decorated meeting room of two floors will hang a wall painting of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double commission from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and retain stable prices.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have recognized that there is a third unencumbered assignment: financial stability.
This third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision that will be announced on Thursday as to whether the United States economy is ready to escape the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a confident growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world's financial markets can also deter the precautionary leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raising the base rate for federal funds — even a quarter of a percentage point.
“Evidently the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"Only I think that if they were looking for reason not to raise the rates, the increased uncertainty around the world market was enough to give them an excuse to wait on," she remarked.
There is no consensus as to what will be done in the Federal Reserve System, which in itself causes fluctuations in the financial market.
Approximately half of the economists recently surveyed in Bloomberg projected an increase in interest rate this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the chances of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the impact by the promise that the next increase will not be expeditious.
On Tuesday, the Doo-Jones index rose to 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The raid was triggered by the expectations that the federal system's policymakers would leave the rate this week, said John Lonski, the chief economist of the Moody's capital Markets Research team.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System increases the rates at this time," he noticed.
If the leadership of the Federal Reserve System does so, “they will have to go far into adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic.”
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal system seemed to be inclined to raise the rate of 0.25% this month, making the first little cap in a slow financial tightening, which could confirm the strength of the United States reconstruction.
Hellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite the Liberian complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs has slowed down in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest in over seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considers full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to be below the annual rate set by the central bank of 2 per cent, the Federal System management stated that the temporary impact of the fall in oil prices was key.
The economy “can also meet higher rates and need them, taking into account the reduction of the labour market”, observed Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were shattered at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Doo-Jones share index for industrial companies fell by 16 per cent of the record high in May because investors feared that the deceleration of the Chinese economy could hinder world growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow-Jones index is now about 10 per cent lower than the Mayan index.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, retaliation to the market is further compounded by difficult calculations of the rate increase.
“In the absence of information on what had happened in the financial markets and on the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have been twisting the guilds at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former member of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, he predicted that they would wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty about how the American economy can be affected, and they have almost no reliable data after recent developments in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal system, and it should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But, in fact, the Federal Reserve System became the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Only a hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could “abuse” its monetary expanse has caused market shocks around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve System would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “better art than science”, noted Zakari Karabell, the leader of the Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “the history of the Federal Reserve System has been overreacting to financial market movements that seem not to be economical.”
Laker, a member of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, who insisted on an increase in the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, “notwithstanding the limited and identified impacts on growth in the United States”, said Laker.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal System abolished these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should take priority on stability only in times of major crises, such as market collapse in 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last panic and not close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't, of course, want to be in a situation where you're frightened by the growth of the rates because the markets are in shock," said Pozen, President of the Institute for the World Economy of Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should go ahead.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/stage is open in 1997 and belongs to LAX-C Inc.

There are shop trolleys and forklifts in the broad passage.
Discovery: The fresh fool of Montong is near the exit.
Where it is: Magazine is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, located at the edge of the Chinese block and the business center of the city, in several quarters from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site that he shares with other stores and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speaker of the Gosduma, Sergei Narichkin, admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees will sway Europe.
The Interfax conveyed that view to journalists in Ulanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiral theories, but the question is questioned: is Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?"
"Surely, someone presumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and devastated people who are being saved from death, would go to the well-being countries of the EU," he added.
Narichkin asked, "Did many European political leaders express themselves frankly about the causes of the crisis, the wave of refugees, which is now literally engulfing their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exception, prefers to be silent," he said.
NATO is of the view that NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.

The United States supports insurgents against Asaad and the IG.
Official Damascus regards such rebels as terrorists.
The President of Syria referred to the cause of the West's resentment to Russia.
The West claims for countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are indeed sovereign States.
This was the opinion expressed by Syrian President Bashar Asad in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTW, Russia Today, TASS, Interfax and Russian newspaper.
According to Asada, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and place another in his place, who would act in the interest of Western countries rather than in the interest of his family.
Asaad drew attention to the sharp breakthrough of western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, President Vladimir Putin of Russia “revolved from a friend of the West into an enemy, king, dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition that has come to power in a non-democratic way, even though he has been elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Asaad in the fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the Western Permanent Statements that Asaad himself should leave, he noted that the President would come to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he departed on the demand of the people, not on the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the President remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Asaad referred to Russia and Iran as friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was taking place with them.
Syria also fights against terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
With regard to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that that country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He challenged the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran gives us military equipment.
“Now there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been done,” he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We can't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-higuel coalition, known by the United States," said Asad.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: Peace: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary John Kerry spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
Reuters, with reference to the representative of the State Department, John Kirby, reports this.
It is noted that the subject of the discussion was a conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide any additional details.
He stated, however, that the United States had tools for the “extreme isolation of Russia”, if it supported the President of Syria, Bashar Asad, transmits the RIA News.
As reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lavrov, in a conversation with Kerri, reiterated the need to establish a single front against terrorist groups operating on the territory of the country.
There were also discussions on ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Previously, American officials stated that Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about the strengthening of Moscow ' s support for Asaad.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper slander on Stralkov.
Alexander Borodai, former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed People ' s Republic of Donetsk, refuted the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview to Lenta.ru correspondent.
Washington Post's note is beautiful because it's totally overwhelmed.
The former DNR Minister of Defense, Igor Stralkova, of course, has not been bound by anyone, and has “drawn out” from the territory of the Republics of Donbas in a very subtle mood, without ropes, without three quarts of money, which are attributed to him by different characters,” he said.
According to Borodai, it was really about Strelkov in a conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Stralkova was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetska People's Republic," said the former head of the DNR Government.
Borodai stressed that he was unaware of why the reporter of the U.S. publication decided to write that Stralkov had been taken to Russia as a “connected”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's incredibly misunderstood words, because I stressed that Stralkov was leaving alone," said Borodai.
"It's slanderous both for me and for Stralkova," he concluded.
Previously, the Washington Post published an article in which Borodai said that he had taken Stralkova to Russia on an enforceable basis.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had been forced to contact his partner.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
The Polish forests have begun to cut trees above the ground tunnel, where, according to some data, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work started on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is essential to verify the reliability of the rumors on the railway composition with treasures.
Arms and valuable minerals may be located inside the trains.
On 31 August, the Governor of Tomasz Smolarz, the Polish Nijessevilese Warrior, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of a gold train was not more convincing than the previous.
However, the authorities had decided to overtake the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Peter Jukhovski, stated that the local cemeteries with “99 per cent probability” found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich as described in legends.
Juhavsky noted that if the assumptions were to be confirmed and the jewelry were to be found, they would be the property of the State treasury, and the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal clients contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Walbjah, saying that they found a train in a scraped tunnel at 70 metres.
The main druglog of RF has proposed banning tobacco sales to persons up to 21 years.
Russia’s main druglog proposed banning tobacco sales until the age of 21.
Eugenius Brunn noted that before that age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful."
So he said in a direct radio broadcast of Moscow, commenting on the information that Speaker Saufeda Valentine Mattvienko supported the idea of prohibiting the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
The man's getting uneven.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you're physically ready for it.
Psychically he's ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, only lasts by the age of 21," noted Brun.
Previously, the member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project “Treasy Russia” Sultan Hamzaev reported to “Isvests” that Mattvienko supported the initiative to raise the age price in the sale of alcohol and “cooperated with the Public Chamber to raise the matter again on the site of the upper House of Parliament”.
According to the activist, the Federation Council will soon establish a working group to draft a bill under the leadership of Matthewnko.
The Bible Asked to Verify the Compatibility of the Children’s Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to verify the Bible ' s compliance with the Federal Law on Protection of Children against Information That Harms Their Health and Development, which correspondent Sib.fm was informed on 16 September.
The author stated that on 26 August 2015 he had acquired a Bible at the Chitai City store in the Red Prospect, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ's "Protecting Children From Information That Harms Their Health and Development".
The statement was adopted on 16 September by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office in Novosibirsk City.
The return of the resident of Novosibirsk will take place within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
More interesting to show the absurdness of the law itself, the complainant commented to correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that will invad society.
It will, however, begin to reread the Bible, which it had never done before.
Brazilian Pediatrics Union Rio Grandi promotes healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization of SPRS has developed a scandal that will convince women of the need for full food during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of babies carrying breasts written by images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbons, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Owing to the high energy needs of pregnant and fertile women, it is recommended that the daily standard of calories be increased by about 500 calories per day.
A recent study, however, shows that one increase in calorie is not the only change in diet that mothers must make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of Beylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the exposure of genes to children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the adverse effects of unhealthy nutrition on the child's immune system have been identified.
Under Hamburg, a school bus was punched by the train.
The train hit the school bus near Hamburg, which was stuck on the railroad.

The accident was estimated at Euro300,000.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of the local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of trauma received in a dial with Philippine Carlo Magali.
The fighting for one of the regional titles of the International Beaver Federation (IBF) versions in weight to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, culminated in the winning of the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a skull trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the lifesaving apparatus.
At the professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in nothing.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second case of fatalities among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old Bradon Smith died of ring injuries.
AIA now recommends that it be better to ban this sport from its point of view.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,' said Stephen Pernis, Vice President of the organization.
But in the form in which boxes now exist, there will always be situations where an athlete gets bleeding or brain trauma, which either causes death or severe injury.
For that reason, AMI believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narichkin called upon the OSCE OSCE to lift sanctions against the parliamentarians of the RF.
The Speaker of the Home of the R.F. Sergei Narichkin described the impossibility of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said that, speaking at the OSCE OSCE session in Ulanbaatar.
We regard this as unacceptable action as an offensive to the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because this manifestation of political disgustingness and ignorance of the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narichkin encouraged OSCE OSCE participants to rebuild Russia and EU partnerships.
Let's bring morality back to politics.
Let us revert to the dialogue and right of international communication.
Let's return the humanistic ideals to a democratic world order.
"Two never ended good," he said.
Speaker from the Parliamentary Assembly called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I invite members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific tasks in the area of security.
“The first is to resolve the Ukrainian crisis by negotiation and the immediate convening of our inter-Parliamentary group,” said Narichkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"It's almost the only common site where we're still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," emphasized the policy.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will continue until 18 September.
I've been winning for a couple or three days.
The world champion on the light athletics, Sergei Schubenkov.
This season can be described as a triumphal 24-year-old light athlete from Barnaul Sergei Schubenkova.
He succeeded at his 110-metre coronary race with barriers to the command of Europe, to set up a few recordes and, above all, to become the champion of the world, the first in the history of a domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final phase of the Brilliant League, taking a third place in the general score.
The New Evidence asked Schubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergei, is the season not yet over for you?
Yes, I'm going to play World War Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I'm going to think about recreation.
True, I'm going to be at home now, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different state.
It's easier than every week to scratch around the world.
You once said that autumn is the favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, early September, is a great time.
After the main start of the season, the load of liability is no longer overdue.
You can be consorted with pleasure at a relaxed one.
Plus, you know, the vacation is very soon...
Is there any fatigue?
Still, the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
The fatigue is always accumulating by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what he did more, he won or lost.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, movements, all of this doesn't go intricately for the body.
Stand up physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, at the upstairs.
I'm just happy.
By the time you're finished at the Beijing World Championship, you come back often?
There are times.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But at all, I think that the bad athlete who lives with old winners spills his successful runs over and over again.
I've won a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
The preparations for this wonderful season were very different from the usual season?
I can't say there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter contest season.
Trained first in Barnaul's house, then at the gatherings, then back home.
It's as usual.
But with the coach, the challenge was to try to get to a new level that I haven't been on yet.
Almost all winter time was spent to lay the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, took exercises in general physical training, which included both the pull and the seat, and the back we rolled.
Then they took up barrier training, and there were many techniques.
Have you been watching the rivals?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with the Internet.
I saw the winter championship of Europe, and the French took all the pededestal in the barrier.
Thinking about something to do, dividing this company.
With every start this season, you added and added to the results.
Did that make you sure?
I have all the last seasons on roughly the same pattern.
There's no one I'm running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I'm always turning my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was escape from 13 seconds.
All the work was primarily directed to that outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel ready for a contest, and you don't always get ready for it.
How was it, for example, in the Olympics in London?
I, honestly, the semi-final run (Shubenkov couldn't get to the final. - "N") tried to forget immediately.
Ready was very good, realistically able to escape from 13 seconds.
Yes, even if you had repeated your best outcome at that time, you'd have become a bronze ghost of Games.
But it's not lucky.
Remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to get in the finals, was such a maximum program.
And he flew right off the morning, in the pre-trial runs.
And then I realized that breaking and breaking my head meant nowhere to escape.
Two years later, the peace championship in Moscow had already reached the final with the best time.
Well, I remember my feelings before a decisive strike: I really wanted to win the gold at that time!
How do you manage to keep your head and keep moving?
And that's the hardest thing to do.
We need to be very careful, focusing on technology, so that we don't wreck the barriers.
I noticed that it's much easier when you're adjusting the process, not the result.
And it's as good as you feel you're running and you're doing it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes, after the first major success, are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever thought that way?
It's still better at home.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I'm trying to be pleased with what I have.
You've been together a long time?
From the age of 12, since I got into a light athletics.
In fact, first I was trained by his wife, who worked with the children, and then she already handed me over.
I started with a spring, then I jumped to a length, triple.
The child's bunny was -- it was when the ball was melted, they jumped long from the place...
At 14, I tried to run barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run, the second adult level has been met.
That's how I stayed.
Has there never been any fear of barriers?
I got to make a deal with them right away.
But there's always a lot to work on.
There's just one scourge!
But there's nowhere to go from this routine.
The technology needs to be pulled away all the time -- so I can wake up at night, I'm going to get up and run through barriers.
Anyone who's seen your run in Beijing claim that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I didn't revise my runs, and I couldn't hold back.
But efficiency needs to be worked on -- no limit to perfection.
Don't you be afraid now that the winning a year before the Olympic Games is going to be a heavy load on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to justify my expectations.
If you picked this road, you should go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no extra cargo should feel.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm amazed at the reaction to the interviews that happened in Ukraine.
People are pissed off, I understand, their bread is not feeding -- give them, get rid of the enemy.
And although I didn't screw up with the flag, and the same thing, exactly the same, was talking here a million times, and the bastard didn't directly call anyone, I was a different deal.
All my pseudo friends were able to do it in a second.
The presing I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, who has seen kinds of fellas, think people are white.
It's like walking, walking, and you've been attacked by a crowd, and you've had a mutusion.
But I need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a gauby, old man, I'm afraid.
Another thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing I ever had was self-sufficiency, so you'll have a bite.
And passports to such bastards as Fred Derst or Monson can only be bastards.
I'd rather be, the best journalist, a shameless job.
A week ago, at Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the criminal events:
What has been done to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the survivor of Khrushev tried to sign something, never to fit into the general picture of human life.
It's how to come to the neighbor and take his place...
The Kremlin war's gone, and it's all over there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like the summer of 2008, she started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin Castle.
I have the assumptions who this could be...
Copsone hasn't lived so much.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin' hands.
Is he going to lose the apartment?
Well, you brought him a monument.
Surely, people remember him as an offenseer of their little homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirvic.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the rating despite attempts by Ninth to highlight the failure of leaders in Today's Show
Carl Stéphanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's release of the leader's seat was unable to raise the rating tonight.
The Ninth morning show was broadcast from the capital of the State after Malcolm Turnbulle Tony Abbot.
The Competent Sunrise, with David Koh and Samanta Armitad, stuck in London in a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture did not seem to have a significant impact on Australian televisioners, with Sunrise audiences with 397,000 audiences in the five largest cities compared with today's 339,000 audiences.
Today, there was a slight increase compared with its rating on Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the Sunrise gap has been reduced in recent months.
In August today there were 318,000, compared with 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 audiences, compared to 314,000 in Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the clarification!
Published TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The important news for Seven was the amazing debut of 800 Words with the ex-star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recent widowed father of the family, who decides to move to New Zealand to the coast with her two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics reasoned whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone without a star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday night is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with 1.136 million audiences, easily rounded by The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh, the luck and failure of Chase Australia was mixed.
The first half an hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television guided by Andrew O'Kife has gathered 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the number jumped to 623,000 spectators, enough to win the Hot Seat Eddie McGuyer (613,000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half hour was 720,000.
Hot Seat has gathered 620,000.
Chase Australia's falling ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a replacement of the Million Dollar Minute, which couldn't play McGuyre's show.

Three finalists are unanimous in the fact that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Will the secret be opened?
Lana Jewon-Felloz, Sarah McKay and Snowan Marcoskey may have been given the chance to figure out who would win in the Halloween.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in the Holostake is surrounded by a secret veil.
And the three girls who reached the end of the day, of course, keep quiet about who they were the last of them.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marcosca and Lana Jewons-Felloz the day before the three girls left, they might have given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet until the final to be held on Thursday
All three women come into a lyrical mood, describing why Wood is the ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, determination, family values, radicality as a reason for each of them to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who shall have the last rose of Wood?"
Jewons Fellows and Marcoskey have no doubt called McKay the perfect pair for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have had a good relationship since the first day.
"From the moment I entered into the group, I felt the energy (Sara) and Sam's energy, and I realized that they were very close to each other, and throughout the entire show I didn't doubt about it," said Jewons-Fellos.
"Sara's a very open person, easy and fun with her," added Marcoskey.
I saw them together, and there's really a burden between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will get a great couple.
McKay herself said that because of her home visits last week, she realized that Wood might have been the same person.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it wasn't just a game -- I believed him with my whole heart," she says.
To whom Vodu should be selected, if she did not, she replied mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve to do it equally.
Shaw The Bachelor comes out on Wednesdays at 19.30 on Channel Ten.

Jarrid Haine had a few options for starting a career at NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were keenly interested in them after he moved to the United States, as well as in many other clubs that sent queries after an impressive open day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Thomsul and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on a bench of spares for losing a ball that the former regby league player had allowed at the first return of the pant to the winning game with the Minnesso at 20-3.
But Thomsul believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return his pant, and he used it to play after Reggie Bush was injured.
Thomsula showed himself well and after the game, in the robbery.
Instead of building newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne's press conference after the match.
Special reporter 49ers Kam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from Thomas McGoy, coordinator of special teams, who encouraged him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost a ball at the re-entry of the Miss Wykings team during the first quarter.
At the beginning of this debut in NHL Hayne and its numerous Australian worshipers were clearly unexpected.
It was seen how Hayne was fighting when he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told the leader of Hamish and Andy at Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a more bad start for the NFL career.
"That happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his failure to a debut in the Origin series of games in 2007, when a ball throw in his locked zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
Eventually, this experience has proved to be very useful for a 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and put a picture in Instagram.
Elton John and President of Russia Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of gays.
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of use of weapons at the Siberian Airport.
The challenge to President Vladimir Putin was opened, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his Oil Company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were suppressed.
Migrants were confronted with the police at the border of Hungary.
Refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which had grown into clashes with law enforcement personnel.
As a result, Hungarian police used watermets and tear gas, transmitting Reuters.
Migrants cast police stones and attempt to remove a fence at the border.
Support was directed to the clash site, and the police were responding to the aggressive acts of migrants and their attempts to break the border.
According to Agnes France-Presse, refugees were able to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The country authorities allowed migrants to arrive in the Croatian territory and to ensure that they were transported to a needy country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the Army in the protection of State borders, the criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the accelerated procedure for handling asylum requests.
The Hungarian Court had already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serb border, which would be deported and could not return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider, as soon as possible, the transfer to the Hungarian Armed Forces of border protection functions.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a barbed wire of 175 kilometres on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russians confessed to the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
According to Reuters, a Russian cyberattack accused of the largest in the history of the United States, Vladimir Drinkmann confessed to theft of more than 160 million credit cards numbers.
During the trial at the Federal Court of New Jersey Drinkmann, he confessed to conspiracy with a view to obtaining unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, a Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian nationals and a Ukrainian national accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
Aggregate damage to the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Such respondents as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drynkmann faces 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a $1 million fine.
The court will take into account the recognition of a Russian person and may reduce the sentence when the sentence is handed down.
Drynkmann's verdict will be issued on 15 January.
Vladimir Drynkmann was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilanac, was detained.
The last one of his guilt is denied in the crimes he has committed.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, with the support of Russia, of the Bashar Asad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary John Kerry, warned that the support of Russian President Bashar Asad of Bashar to the Syrians exacerbated the conflict in the country.
“The secretary of Carrie made it clear that Russia's support for President Asad risked exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal to combat extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition from the power”, says a communication published on the U.S. State Department.
Kerry reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to combat the grouping of the Islamic State (whose activity is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Asaad will never be a reliable member of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the Syrian conflict could only be resolved by a political transition from Asad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the Asad regime.
On the eve of the White House Spokesman, Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation, unless he ceases to support Asada.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to accede to the international coalition that conducts an anti-terrorist operation against the “Islamic State”.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
To that end, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and had helped Syrians to learn technology to use it against the Islamists.
Four died when the police fired rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four persons, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the proposed new Constitution, as the official stated on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday, in Rupandea district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the District Police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas, then fired in the air before rubber bullets were fired.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets, which are known to be killed, but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
This clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where Madezi states that the new provinces under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among the citizens of the Taru population who wanted to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, starting with 10
On August, when the four main political parties signed a country-separation agreement in the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Saianc plans to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Saiansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s, as a centre of the chemical industry, with an advanced infrastructure requiring systemic support.
A year ago, Saiansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borowski.
On the outcome of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he told the Correspondent of the Area.
Oleg Valerjević, why did you start working as a mayor?
I first learned the results of financial and management audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
A audit of municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps was the reduction of the documentation to five days.
Earlier papers were available for months.
Income and cost optimization activities have been developed.
Last November, a visiting meeting of the Government was held in Xayanska, which addressed the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project-based documentation (ERP) for a single facility in the city.
Without that, Saiansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of SDD on the roads, the kindergarten, the northern sewage convoy and the water.
Road operations are now in place at two locations.
How is the decree of the President of the RF on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 children were born in Xayanska.
This positive demographic has not been observed in the city for the past 27 years.
So the issue of seating in kindergarten is one of the most relevant.
Since 1 September, the children ' s child ' s refurbishment was closed at 320 locations.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
Last year, a child’s garden No. 23 was opened and 200 children are now visiting.
Refurbishment was made under the conditions of cofinancing from the regional and local budgets, with more than 67 million roubles.
Through the efforts of the administration and assistance of the provincial Government, funds were sought to purchase furniture and equipment, and the National Initiatives programme also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we are planning to eliminate the regularity of children between the ages of one and a half and three.
We don't have three- to seven-year-old turns.
Investors show interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that building in the city must be done primarily by the soijan enterprises, and that is what they need to be employed.
Already in October, a 60-home for orphaned children in Leningradsky is being operated.
With regard to construction, I will add that Saiansk is one of the four towns of Priangaria, which has entered the housing programme of an economic class.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 clusters will begin shortly.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing for those wishing to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square meter, and that value includes the sub-key section.
If we deal with the quantities, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At the same time, the territory was built by a Saian pigcomplex, which was sold for a price in 2004.
We are working with the Procurator's Office to challenge the transaction.
The more land under object is in federal property.
Work is under way with Moscow, the issue of the transfer of 88 ha to regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of a project of 1.5 billion roubles.
With a pig complex, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
A social partnership institution will be developed in Sayanska?
We have some 140 social and economic partnership treaties.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Satisfactory support is provided for enterprises such as East Central LAW, New-Zimin TEC, Sayan broiler, IDF CPC, and the management of these enterprises responds to all treatments.
Directly to the Day of the City of OOO, “Sayan broyler”, a small town was given to the city, East Centr repaired a horse palace where professionals were working with children with an ipatherapy, spending more than 1 million roubles.
The sponsorship has made it possible to benefit the U.S.L.A. area.
The sponsors helped to celebrate the city’s Day with beauty.
As in old good times, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
The story of the city, the book of the Sian poets, was released.
The first and the people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Saiansk have been given to jubilee medals.
Mecenates are also involved in the city charitable fund.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, over 800,000 roubles support talented children to help children in need of expensive treatment to support children from low-income families.
How is the social workforce in Sayansk addressed?
There is a lack of professional doctors and teachers in town.
The provision of housing for professionals is of great importance to address the human resources issue.
During the past year, we had five doctors’ apartments, and four teachers received service housing.
We have a home allocation programme with the opportunity to privatize it five years later.
Plans are to replant the building, which will build eight more pedagogical apartments.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "House for the Russian Family" programme.
In the long run, the construction of a budgeted building.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can deal with the most difficult issues.
It is important from all crises to make the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
Saiansk and our region have a potential.
A social-pence indexing bill has been introduced in Duma, taking into account the increase in prices.
A bill has been introduced to the General Assembly for the indexing of social pensions every year since 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, a deputy from “Russian Justice”, Alexander Lomakin-Rumians, also proposes an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April if the growth rate of a living minimum exceeds the rate of rising prices for goods and services.
Social Pencement is indexed every year from 1 April, taking into account the growth in the living minimum of the retiree in the RF over the past year.
The draft law introduced to the lower chamber provides for the introduction of the social pension index, taking into account the growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation is 1 February and the second is 1 April.
The head of the OSCE OSCE stated that Mogerini was inadmissible to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the European High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini Speaker OSCE, Ilka Canerva, declared that sanctions against the legislators participating in the Assembly were inadmissible.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE OSCE in Ulan Bator Nikolav.
According to TACS, the signatures of the European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were gathered in support of Canerva's position.
"So much support has been formed," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the OSCE head of the OSCE had intended to collect the signatures of deputies, which had indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians could not be imposed.
In particular, Kowalev noted that Canerva had promised to raise the problem to the level of the governing structures of the European Union and to “report the petition”.
NHC reports that 60 per cent of the cyclone south of Green Mouse Islands
The broad front of the low pressure area, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern end of the Greenway Islands, is likely to be 60 per cent of the tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday to the U.S. National Hurricane Centre.
Another clear area of low pressure between the Green Mice Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports the synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a doubling campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced the commencement of the doubling campaign for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations that assisted European refugees fleeing from war- and depleted countries.
Google used a non-character personal approach to announce the collection campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masoud, a member of the Kabul family, when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We got into doubtful trains and buses, famine, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family desperately need assistance.
The donations will be handed over to four non-profit organizations assisting refugees and migrants: “Physicians without borders”, the International Committee of Rescue, the Save the Children Organization and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which caused more than 4 million people to move this year.
Many have also fled from war-affected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Small obesity diabetics can help with obesity surgery
The positive effect of obesity after surgery in people with a slight obesity of 2 type may last at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to say that diabetics with little obesity live longer after obesity surgeons than those who receive non - hyurological treatment.
“The mortality statistics are not immediately shown,” said Dr. Robin Bluxtoun, an obesity surgeon expert, who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Editor Surgery column.
The surgeon of obesity, or barriatrical surgery, uses various methods to reduce the stomach size.
They reduce famine and limit the ability to organize food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved its effectiveness in treating diabetes 2 type, but major studies have been conducted among morbid obesity people with an index of the body mass (MMT) 35 or more.
The weight measure of the IMT is considered normal for 18.5 to 24.9.
The IMT 25 or above indicates that the person is overweight, and people with IMT over 30 are regarded as obesity.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Thai Min-Sheng General Hospital have used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatrial surgery - sewing stomach and glove gasstrectomy, with diabetes 2 type medical treatment for people with little obesity.
The average value of IMT for surgeons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the IMT has approximately 29.
Among the survivors, 36 per cent of the diabetes was fully cured and 28 per cent partially.
For comparison, only 1 per cent of the diabetes received medical treatment and only about 2 per cent partially.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the LPNP cholesterol “were in general better in the surgical group” are said by the authors.
Researchers also monitored levels of hemoglobin A1s in blood, which reflect blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to keep below 7%, writes researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin level A1c decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8 per cent.
But the best glycemic control indicators, reflected by the good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared to the group that had carried the gloomy hastractomy, the sewage group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg) and lowered the IMT (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent), as well as closer to the full diabetes (46.9 per cent to 16.7 per cent).
Although a new study does not demonstrate the benefits of a surgical method for life after five years, there is evidence from a study of surplus surgeons in Sweden that surgical treatment actually leads to an increase in life expectancy, according to the Blextoun College of Medicine at Finix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric interference, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blextoun noted that this encouraged people with IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report here is very important because it states that such surgical intervention is safe in a low-IMT group where there is no higher risk of death or renovation,” she said.
Blextoun added that people and their doctors should start to take seriously the weight as soon as the patient's IMT falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
I think it's very difficult to reverse this as soon as they dig out genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies.
In Mitches, robbers have been removed from the home and 9 million roubles.
In Mitches, the robbers attacked the residents of the mosquito house and stole 9 million roubles and three women's coats.
That's what Interfax informs with a reference to the IMD press service.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered a house on the street of Horn, tied the 20-year-old son of the host home and, threatening with both knife, kidnapped 9 million roubles and three shubbs.
Preliminary data indicate that the damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 roubles, and that a criminal case was initiated under the article “Dissue”.
European fanates are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the world's soccer championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotels have not yet rushed to obtain a permit.
In the view of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the front of the world’s high priesthood, the authorities will have to think about how to resettle all the visitors of the city.
Disbalta interlocutors believe that the rental of rented apartments will increase by 10 to 30 per cent because of the tournament, and after the rental championship they will have to repay.
The world soccer champion has made the authorities pay attention to the situation of Russian hotels.
According to the law specifically written under the primary title, each Pieterburg Hotel must be classified and prove that it is in accordance with the stated number of stars and the level of service.
Now it is clear that not everyone can do this: hotels are so fearful of checking that they often do not even send documents for requests by the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimir, the department has examined 138 hotels and is now planning to bring 34 hotels cases, many of which simply did not respond to the antimonopoly.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by spreading a number of stars in the advertising industry, Vladimirs has noted.
The problem is, now in the account, literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
The rulers suspect that during the soccer championship, the fans will take over all the peterburg hotels.
Today, tourists may count 30,500.
According to Smolno, 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-and-three-star, 550 single-star hotels.
According to the First Vice-Committee for Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified to date - so many audits have been conducted by companies accredited in Petersburg.
It is not clear whether a hotel ordered such a procedure for regional enterprises, Smolny, on an amazing basis.
That is, there may be more classifications, but no one knows.
“The last six months of hotels have not been very trying to undergo classification,” admitted the director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union touristry Ekaterin Shadska.
This is due to the high season, during which the hotels earn most of their money and do not want to do other business.
Another reason is the budgets in which the audit costs have not been budgeted and the hotel may be required, depending on the status of between 30 and 100,000 roubles and more.
But recently, hotel managers were intensified and began applying for classification, assured by Shadska.
Hotels have to be completed until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine but will not yet be entitled to work at the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed fee for the hotel for the time of the tournament will be developed.
The cost formulas will be announced next year.
This is done to prevent the flow of prices by 200 to 300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not allow a double to three times, but hotel needs to be paid.
"I think it'll go up to 50%," explained President of the Russian Hotel Association Hennady Lampchin.
Vadim Vladimir, in turn, is not sure that price fixes correspond to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much it goes into the economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than a stubborn journey," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the Houses have introduced a bill prohibiting hostages in residential homes.
It is very hopeful that this law will not be enacted or dealt with by Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels must be preserved,” Nan Gwachiya believes.
However, she said that the owners of the Minitors should in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the Master approves the bill, some 80 per cent of the hosts will be closed in Petersburg, and at this time there are 1.5,000 numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restorators and Hotels of the North-West Leonid Garbar, there are two- and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are just used by football wards, but there is a crossing towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation where “75,000 spikes sit in the 80-thousands of stadium”.
You can fix it just with the mini-boys.
Their possible ban, the expert believes "idiotism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but the visitors can't do anything."
If the host is used as a hostage, I agree that it's wrong.
But if a hotel to which guests are coming for a short time, why not?
Mini guests are at risk of losing the world championship on football and because of their volatility.
Hundreds of little hotels simply do not have to pass the classification, with it digging for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all the hotels in the city will be ordered.
“The communiqués that may not do so much, so they will refuse less paid orders from the mini-delivery, and will choose the travellers,” noted Hennady Lampchin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the tests that have been conducted are far above the petherburgs.
The reason for the peterburg delay is, inter alia, the permanent shifts in the Government ' s tourist bloc, which does not contribute to harmonized work.
In the view of experts, if the peterburg hotels were not enough, it was likely that it would be necessary to draw attention to the hotels and rest houses.
As an example of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized to the city, that is, the tournament's guests can live in cabins.
In addition, many inmates will be trained to attend vans where they can stay.
"The main thing isn't to set up so many hotels to keep them empty," I'm sure Hennady Lachin.
Fresh housing will also be very popular during football prize.
The city's most likely to have a reservoir of rented apartments.
Ten-30% rental rates will rise.
“Of obviously, the first to go away from the stadium,” noted the Lease of the Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Larisa Bragin.
The lease price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the bedroom areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport breedings on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that Petersburg was always a hospitable city where people are not just telling the road but can also conduct a mini-excursion.
There are complications.
My dad met a family from Murmansk, my father, my mother, and two children in the yard in the 1970s.
They found themselves sleeping nowhere — the hotels were hard at the station to sleep.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," remembered the interviewer.
True, he added that now that kind of thing in the city's people is not left to call home is the consequences and the frightening thing.
But in 2018, after the failure of the Master’s decisions, the errors of the hotels and governments will have to remember the past?
Zyrinov's "sell" in the Amur district.
With admiration, he looked at the Girinovsky clown in the Lord today.
He was doing things like that when our generation was just learning to trade in newspapers, and he's still in beautiful shape.
The theme of the statement, for example, is “the LDDP protest against the Amura elections”.
The protocols are not shaking - for there is nothing; there are no other protocols other than those signed by the votes.
Here he raises the second John Abraham and shouts, "Here is the winner of the elections!"
At the same time, he throws himself on Rodnin and then, after the communion with the presiding officer, removes the faction from the conference room, crying literally, "You are all with the fronts of your guinea and thieves."
The press, of course, emphasizes, not Abraham, but the faction scandal and demars as a result of that scandal and insult.
Really, Wolfović made a beautiful and elegant slipping of the Amur area together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Gyrinovsky in the style of Pounds, not a political party protest against the results of specific elections.
And the faction was formally scandaled, and the elections, if you believe to the party site and Facebook Ivan Abram, are not recognized, but the leader on the subject is obviously tearing off.
Gives the dead in Amura to bury their dead themselves, and he himself evangelizes against the “Led Russia” in general and in no way the right Rodney.
It's an elegant decision not to lose a person, nor to be a real one, not a showy scandal, to go.
Another matter is that Abram himself is now in a strange situation.
In addition to the screams of the boss, he waited for nothing, no protocols on his hands.
It is not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, it is for the narrow circle that it has become a formal occasion to insult the respected champion, and, moreover, the hammes to the ER and the ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main electoral beneficiary, the region number 2 policy and candidate number 1 for the only district one, it can become a couple that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-development for the same ONF and the party leadership of another.
I'm sure he wouldn't have been Girinovsky, and he should have come up and watched him respectfully.
The trump is still growing and growing before him.
The news was that the LDP would return to the hall during the next prisoner.
I mean, the bang fell out of nothing at all.
Only, Abraham's theme was underneath.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, said Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies with the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhist called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama touched on the continuing crisis of refugees in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama sympathy centre in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the current circumstances, the interests of humankind must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although it was admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While Dalai Lama was highly responsive to the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must also think about durable solutions, how to bring real peace and present development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following the terrorist acts of 9/11, stiff United States responses launched a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this has caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have swallowed a hand-defense over the past 4 years
The Toxicological Centres in the United States reported almost 400 per cent increases since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who had swallowed a hand-wife with high alcohol, according to the Georgian Toxicological Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord López, director of the Georgian Toxicological Center, the number of child grips to 12 years of hand disinfecting liquids reported to toxicological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances, and unfortunately some of them are being sent to the ambulance office,” said Lopes CNN.
He explained that some children drink a disinfecting liquid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends or to dispute over social networks.
The videos on Youtube show how adolescents drink dezinating liquid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed the disinfecting liquid with the alcohol-containing fluid for the mouth to obtain a stronger beverage.
Younger children may be attracted by pleasant smells of disinfecting liquid.
"The child doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopes.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting hand liquids) are the ones that are aromatic.
There are disinfecting liquids for hands that smell tubers, grapes, oranges that are very attractive to children.
The hand-disinfecting fluid contains between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Small children, especially a few sprays, can be alcoholic.
"This is a high concentration alcohol," told Fox 4 to Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of the Toxicological Center at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave that whiskey rubber, but people keep these hand-defensive tools in mind, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently swallowed a hand - handed hand with a tuberculosis of about four sprays, was sent to the ambulance office for treatment.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally considered to be alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance office.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate child clinic to keep her from missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, told Ritchi.
"It was very scary," told the CNN Oratory Scott, Naigi's mother.
That could have been deadly for my child.
López recommended that parents and teachers use non-spiritual substances or disinfecting salphets, in addition to removing disinfecting liquids for the hands of children from the zone of reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting liquids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after they swallowed a disinfecting tool containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three Quartet Classroom pupils in northern New York agreed to poison their “opposing” teacher by “proliferation of antibacterial substances in class”, according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy on hand disinfectors, and she banned holding them in her classroom.
The police believe that the unsuccessful plan was "empty conversations" and addresses the subjects of discipline to the school district.
Like the oldest child library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K.
The youngsters who come after the books are trying to feed her with confetti.
For several generations, the library has been in the course of 95 years.
The earliest readers in the twenties of the last century had a loud readership here, had a show on the poems of Mayakovsky, had literary victorins, and had been copied with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted four years, and, as reported in 1939 in the newspaper The Young Stannik, with each day “the friendship between the Hope of Constantine Krupska and the Friends of the Baby Library of Barnaul” grew stronger.
Constantine’s hope even sent a child photograph to some distant Barnaulian friends.
And when the Barnaulers asked whether Nadia Constantine was opposed to the library’s name, she wrote that it was not, no, it was not.
The writings have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and great - grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose abhorrent profile has been decorated by the barrel in the library building.
During the years of restructuring, various people often called, and they wondered, Why is the child library not renamed?
May there be a library of the name of some good child writer, without political colour!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Cool" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby, a track from the yellow brick.
"The magician of the deficient city" is the favorite subject of the artist Oli Moscowka.
She used to be the manager of the legal company, to attend the office at eight, to go to five, and all the other managers were only a love of drawing.
And then I found an announcement on the Internet, "Illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "My mom has cancer."
Olah made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any time, and no miracles would happen if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates child books of writers all over the world, and makes tales herself.
It's traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they live more and more in some virtual space...
But the children who read go to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the Russian planet, the director of the Tatiana Kushvid library.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that a child library is needed, and she'll live, and the kids are coming here!
I think interest in reading is coming back.
In the library's lobby, there's a big exhibition with an updated photo-exposition.
Once on a quarter, new photographs of readers go to the library of the entire family — Mom, Dad, and children.
The library is pleased that the pope’s children have become increasingly involved.
When the child read all Chukovsky at two years of age, he needs more difficult books when he is older.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-old vanderkind from publishing books of category 12+.
To get a book like that, the child has to bring his parents -- they come back, then come back again, and gradually, "The Crupe" becomes a kind of family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of benches and eras, to lead Corolenko in the annex to the journal "Niva", the "Murzilka" shuffle in 1936.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, no work, no school, -- explains Tatiana Kushweed.
We can come to read, play, paint.
We've made a little kid's play zone, the baby just comes to play, and the hand still pulls on the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they are stuck with legs, and they don’t want to leave.
Often moms come with wheelchairs -- and we're happy that they put the library first among all the rest of the place they have to come with the little ones.
Tatiana Kushvid says, "Certain children like we used to like classical child literature:
“Education is developing, and a lot of attention is being paid to the authors who are the intergenerational linkage.”
And if you're talking about little kids, it's important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes tracts for parents, describing what is happening in modern child literature, what books are worth noting, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden to deliver books beyond the reading room to adults.
This magical privilege only has children.
...in the most distant room of the library, there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookstore.
The staples will scratch under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
With your childhood book, you meet like an old comrade: hello, good you and I don't change.
Ellie's still merry walking on the road with a yellow brick, a Tol Reegikov ribbon steals magical matches, and Malchish-Kibalchish didn't say to the cursed military Тайn burgers, he's got a firm word.
Books are like passwords, and you can find out yours anywhere.
There's a vault and real book rareness -- for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of benches with eggs and eras.
Or to take the King's name in the famous annex to the journal "Niva".
Or the Murzilka shovel in 1936.
It's been time that the pages are old, they're colored in tea color.
These publications are no longer available to readers.
It's a slice of our future collection, and I'm all dreaming of getting out for retirement and taking on rare child books.
But the kids aren't going to do that, and the paints in old books aren't very bright, and the subjects... open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the comsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was interesting, says Galina Ilasov's "Russian Planet", who leads the bookstore.
The Murzilka pages are dark from time to time.
Galina Vasilevna's been driving the bookstore all her life.
She knows the color of Buratino's collapsing, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of Gryffindor's cudic championship, in which situations Karlson uses the slumberer for the motor, and whose father, Alisa Selezeneva, works.
The librarian pays little for his work, and all who can live without those books are finding a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convincing: educators, teachers, ministers of the book.
They can also be learned by smiling, which is considered to be a professional characteristic of a child librarian.
If he smiled on your first minute of conversation, it's a professional.
I like child books at all: how a librarian I like to have them to be just and beautifully standing on the shelves, and I also like to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical, tales, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the rods.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or grandchildren...
A rummer: Seltic doesn't have any differences.
Griffiths refuted discussions about differences in Seltic after Deala's confession that Hups is in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scotland Soccer Association claim to Nailson, and Warberton fears the signing of contracts in January that may violate the team ' s unity.
Dons increased the pre-Seltic to five points
Adam Runey's toolbars in the first time gave Aberdina a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodre, which allowed Dons to get back from Seltic to five points.
Griffiths refuted discussions on differences
This led to rumors of differences in the Seltic, which were suppressed by Griffith, claiming that he and his team associates are not suffering from any increased criticism in preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling tension, I think players are looking for him.
Dutch people are bored because Scotch people aren't in the fight for titles - de Bur.
Former Reingers Advocate and former member of the Netherlands assembled by Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football fans had lost interest in Seltic because he did not compete for the title of Reingers.
Where Bur, the Ayaksa representative now said, "In Holland no longer show the most attractive moments of the games "Seltic," and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about Reingers' return.
They're talking about an old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the Star firm games, and not only do people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltic is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
With the defeat of Malmö, and as a result, the exit of the League of Champions was soon followed by 10 Aberdin football players, who now, after five points away, takes up the top line of the table.
However, Dala said, "The village had bad periods and before, and we're going to go back."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it's very sad, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And we, too, but we need to keep going.
And we really really need the support of Seltic because of that players getting much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton awaits January transfers with distrust.
Despite the views that emerged just a couple of weeks ago, implying that he had defined some of the objectives of January transfers, Marc Warberton ' s boss of Reingers was distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford attacker said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players that come in the summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group at this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
Michu, who's interested in Seltic, was talking about the end of his career.
Suonsi Micha, tied to Seltic during a transfer window, implied that he could leave soccer after his contract with the Lebians is completed.
The 29-year-old player had been suffering from ankle problems for two years and had been unable to leave Wales this summer.
"Harts" is going to resist SFA with Nileson's statements.
"Harts" was led with account 2:1, when Patterson was removed and began to play 3:2, but the red card was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card, cancelled in eight months.
Nailson does not refuse his words, saying, "I have not questioned the ethics, I have not commented on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasl.
The stubborn gamer of the Hibernian team received a speech after acknowledging that he sang a song with insulting words about the former gamer "Harts" Rudy Scakela.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh derbi in Tinkasl in March 2014.
"It was a derbi, and it was a commotion," said the attacker, adding, "I can't be sure to say I wasn't going back to Tinkasl if he didn't play for Seltic."
Donnelly: The Tannadys Council is sure of the management of Dandy United.
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dandi United Directors' Board remains confident that the managers' team will change the situation to a better place, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We're going to get the boys out again," said Donnelly.
Macinnes is glad to win with Hamilton.
Derek Makinness admitted that his Aberdin team had had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assys to achieve the seventh consecutive victory in the first instance of the League, which placed them on five points above the Seltic, upstairs tournament table, thanks to Adam Runey's toolbars in the first secret.
McInness said, "There's no team here that wins anything, a cup, or a champion of leagues who didn't win the meetings in this way."
Unemployment among Scotlanders does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it increases
Scotland remained at 164,000 people during the period from May to July, while the total number of non-workers in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was 5.5 per cent higher for the United Kingdom, as indicated by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland dropped by 12,000 in three months, with 2,622,000 working now.
The employment rate for Scotland fell from quarter to 74.0 per cent, above the average figure of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
The Minister for Scotland, David Mandell, commenting on the most recent figures, noted: “The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the Scotland labour market in increasing employment and reducing unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, while I avoid legal interference at a late stage, I will watch the execution of a human being.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit at the death chamber gallery in Oklahoma, when Richard Glossipp is executed with a fatal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As I approached this day, I became afraid.
So why do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who want often more than places, the results of a glotery will decide who will be chosen.
In the Oklahoma, the number of press places has decreased from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'll sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have our own relationship with him after a few months of telephone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk to him.
The prison administration argues that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a note and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me of being impartial in Twitter.
That's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could make it better, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossipp didn't agree with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he said it.
I told him he could cut me out of his witness list at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I've written down.
I'm not going to go here in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossipp is not guilty.
His actions after Barry van Trezee's murder make him guilty of aiding the crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death penalty was not sufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be entirely objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can ask for it.
You'll learn from me what it's like to watch a person who I like dies without need.
The police have persuaded the man to get out of the Canning River
A constable from the town of Canning Weil managed to convince a man to get out of the Canning River and to remain dry.
Pert's resident intended to leave the police, but he couldn't get stuck in the dirty water on the shallow water in a few yards away from a police officer trying "to softly persuade him to get to shore."
The Canning Weil police was summoned on Tuesday for illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them by throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't sail far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Casldine.
The Laklan Perhawitz Constable didn't want to urinate the form, so he used a safer reception, "negotiations with a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Casldane.
That's what Ben Kazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazins drove to the kuvet to avoid meeting the police patrol to test alcohol and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts have been in vain, but it has led the locals to invent a joked "Byatlon Ben Kazins."
Peter Moody's accusing the stewards of trying to spy and threatening to get out of the horse sports.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria of putting a spy into his studio last year and threatened to leave a horse sport immediately.
His target was the stewards and the Racing Victoria Ethics Division, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and the removal of Lady Tatai as a result of the violation of the rules of the use of drugs on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Mudy told Fairfax Media that he was always making every effort in jumping, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Lydary test on the cobalt, which he could not explain.
He's been speaking about suspicion of spying for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I didn't mean to talk about it, and I've endured for a long time, but sometimes you're so out of line that you don't stop," said Mudy.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
Tonight, I'm going home and I'm going to sleep fast.
I want to walk with my head high up and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that's not right, then I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think what to do with my license.
Previously, Mudy sensationally stated during an interview at racing.com that the Ethics Division was trying to spy on his studio.
"Five years ago, Terry Baley, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man I call, if they ask, and offered him a job in my convenience to transmit information about what I was doing in my studio," said Mudy at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is so, they should no doubt be all made statements because they failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondrey, the External Executive Director of RVL, knew about this all the time.
Shouldn't that make me think that it's becoming personal?
Shouldn't RVL be bold and call for responsibility for what's going on in this business, other people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Are I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's the same.
Maybe they should take my license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I got to the point where I don't care, and it's upsetting me.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and will hold them accountable for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach had only increased during a long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari, and the last removal of the horse from the start made him claim that he could “dump his license on the table”.
Mudy, the most well-known by preparing an invincible championship of Black Kaviar, called the requirements for medical treatments on the day of competition “smoothy” after the horse's legs had been compressed from clay, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on leaping.
“I must bear full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly compressed her on her leg.
She could have compressed last night.
She could've got it yesterday as she was.
She was with him the day she ran.
Mudi may be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of medical drugs on the day of competition for compression, for which the stewards have opened the investigation.
It's anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Mudy.
A driver who made a ride and escaped from the Kabram scene was arrested
The police arrested a man who hit a motorcycleist in Cobrama on weekends and escaped from the scene.
Motorcycles were taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after his car hit Murray Valley Haway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help the injured motorcycler.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is envisaged that he will be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcycler, a 40-year-old resident of Kabram, remains stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm trainer, Craig Bellamy, vaporizes the charges of rivals in the use of rigid force receptions
The Melbourne Storm trainer, Craig Bellamy, described the criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as the "innovation of the agenda" on the part of the two favourites of the NRL champion.
The Sydney Rusters trainer, Trent Robinson, stated that the judges allowed the Storm to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of Storm at the final stage of the Sydney qualification game on Friday night.
Brisbine Broncos Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on Storm after his team won the final qualification tournament at Nozern Queensland Kaubois on Saturday, when he called this game "typical" for the regby League and said that two of Quinsland's teams were not "the most successful" in the handheld.
Bellamy defended the intercept of the ball by his team and said they were just focused on the "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident of the criticism of his team by the two leading coaches, since that means that they are concerned about the possible defeat of the St.
"This continues to rise - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about rigid receptions when they played us with 24:2 account," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our protective systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've given special attention to contacts in the intercept of the ball, and it's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's clearly trained a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, and it's been some shock to him.
It's fascinating how it's always shown at this time of the year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea about the impressive football, reminding his teacher that Saint-Jorge-Illawarra Dragonts had won Bennett's championship in 2010, showing a bunch of footballs.
Wayne's talking about fascinating football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," he observed Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George criticized a lot by calling him a boring team, and Wayne said he wasn't cared for.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks as impressive soccer, especially his young semi-defensors at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you've got those players.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play soccer in his style -- not every team has two semi-defensors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunte so they can play that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they're somewhat worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a match with a lot of points than the Broncos and Caubas game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the count? 16-12?
He was 20:18 in our game, there were two more attempts -- and what, is this impressive soccer?
Or is it impressive to take breaks and failures?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means we can meet them there at some point.
Storm's at the end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to host either the Nort Queensland Kaubas or Cronalla Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the pre-final stage at the AAMI Park, the tickets will be sold the next Tuesday morning.
Serb in charge of drug storage is bailed at $200,000
A man who is threatened with life imprisonment for trying to assign 40 kg of cocaine shipped to Queensland was released under a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maximović, 29 years old, was one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police had discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solei yachte from South America, through Vanuatu and in Coomer in August.
All morning, Maximović and his associates were seen at the wharf, and later he met with them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximović is threatened with a lifetime for attempting to seize narcotic drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, attorney Maximovich argues that evidence that the latter attempted to obtain the whole party is missing and that the man could be in the cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flenagan doubted that Maximovich had to be released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He travels often to Serbia," he said before the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and her father, Maximovich, were invited to make a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“The testimony of both shows that the amount of $200,000 is too much of a financial burden for them,” observed Judge Flenagan.
But one measure was not sufficient to guarantee that it would not disappear, but the judge added it.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail provided that he would pass both his Australian and his Serbian passports to the police on a daily basis and observe the curfews from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m..
Fotis Kacicaris: "I'm fighting the assembly of Greece, which has fought until the last seconds."
The chief Greek coach, Fotis Kacicaris, paid due tribute to his team after 1/4 of the date of Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game had made some mistakes.
It was a big game, quotes AFP Kacicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish game.
They tried to work off the defense, but the defense errors determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
"I'll be assigned to Kaun."
Joel Friland, a new JESA, said he didn't believe in an army curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win Euroliga in the next season.
I talked to Dimitris Itudis a few times this summer and, in itself, after I joined the team, quotes "R-Sport" of Freelands.
Yeah, I'll take some time to restructure to the central position, but I've got to play more forwards in the NBA.
Now we're going to have to fight more with the big center rival, but I've been doing this before, so I think, and I'll be able to do it now.
The Armenians won Euroliga for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have traveled six times to the Four Final, but they couldn't show up their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team has got a glimpse.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the frustration of the club and his fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we can do, we have a good chance to win Euroliga, I really think.
I always wanted to win this title, Moscow's already winning the tournament, and I think this year is going to be the year of CSCA.
With regard to the eye, I am not a superstitious person or believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any ritual before playing, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "I'm gonna have a special match with "Roma."
The Chief Barcelona coach, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first tournament of the group tournament of the League of Champions with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his current and former team would be far from ranking.
Remember, Luis Enrique trained wolves in the 2011/12 season, but he failed to show himself on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I went back to Rome a few years later, and I've gained some experience, and I've got the official Web site of the VEFA words of Luis Enrique.
I have solely warm memories with Rome.
It'll be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start at the League of Championships with the victory.
The Augustov meeting on the Cube of Joan Gamper will not affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the "Roma" game she showed in series A v. Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Stander" has various options for attacking."
The Acting Prime League Principal Principal Trador, Vadim Skripchenko, noted the diversity of the attacking rival team.
According to the mentor, "bikes" have several models of the attack in their arsenal.
The meeting will take place on 21 September and begin at 16.30 on Moscow Time.
Let's see how we're playing with "Skripchenko" and we're going to give you an official website of "Urala" words.
We have a week of training ahead of us.
This team has various options for attacking, multidimensional attacks, at the same time, and we're not slow, so I think it's a very interesting game.
On the verge of this game, given that the Chancellor is performing a European League match against the Pretmund Borouss, we'll try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Canyas: "Astan's house can pick the glasses of anyone."
The Astana Defenseer Roher Kanyas, after the first tournament of the group tournament of the League of Champions with the Banfika (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
In the Habek field, astaniens are able to select points from any rival.
Even though the match was hard for us, I can say we played well, and the official Web site of the VEFA news of Kanyas.
"Benfix" is higher than class, but in the home match, I think we can count on taking the glasses away from them.
It's real.
But first, you have to think about Galatasari, and then about Atletico.
In the home matches, we can take the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benites, "I'll do it all the time: Krishtian Ronald is the best in the world."
Rafael Benitez, Chief Coacher of Real, expressed satisfaction at the major victory in the 1st tourist group tournament of the Champion League with Shahrer (4:0).
The specialist gave a tribute to Forward Krishtian Ronaldu, who was the author of three heads.
The match was not easy because the Shachter can own the ball, and it brings the official Web site of the words of Benites.
The rival did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always at risk.
I'm not saying "Real" played perfectly, but we had the bare opportunities.
I'm happy that we didn't miss the balls and we killed four.
Krishtian Roald confirmed his level.
It's the best player in the world, I'll repeat it all the time.
Jordie Alba: "Cristian Ronald cannot be like the Messiah."
The Barcelona Defense, Jordie Alba, believes that no one can compare with his colonel Lionel Messiah.
According to the Spanish, Krishtian Ronald's forward Kreala can't do that either.
The Messiah is five heads above the rest, quotes Le Figaro Albu.
Even Krishtian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniel de Rossi: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a vivid individual.
The Roma De Roma de Ross opponents noted the importance of compactity and insurance in playing with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 on Moscow Time.
Remember, the SE will make its text broadcast.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players, quotes the official Web site of WEFA de Rossi.
It's hard to play with blue grenades because they have not only unique styles but also bright personalities.
To leave them, we're going to have to bury each other throughout the match and insure each other.
The Messiah is almost always successful when it comes to the siege, so we need to keep compact and organized.

The next match is going to take a ride against Slovan.
I hope I'm going to go out in the next start-up match, bringing the R-Sports to Jehova's words.
I'm not an expert on gadgets, I'm the gatekeeper, we don't have any repeats of missing heads, so it's hard to track.
Dinamo plays well, everybody has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather miss more, but the team won.

Lucy Shafarzov is hospitalized with bacterial infection, reports AFP.
To date, the Czech tennisist is at the Brno Clinic.

Stevan Hog used the girl's phone to make paedophiles send photos.
Pedophil used the 11-year-old phone to search for images of violence against children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered on the Internet communication service, where he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone missing, and found it in the hand of Hog sleeping.
She checked him and found shocking pictures, after which she immediately turned her mother to it.
The police arrived and saw five images, followed by research on computers found at the address, and found “relevant” requests for searches using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hog then said to the police that he did it, because it could "take the paedophiles" and then he would "would pretend he was a policeman to scare them."
The Commissioner of the Judicial Execution, Ailed Robertson, informed the Sheriff court in Dandy: “He said that it was an addiction, he had become frightening people.
He admitted that he had made computer requests, but he said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare the paedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation with the unknown person who sent him the images and asked for more photographs.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a head problem when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw the obscene pictures on the phone, and there was an eye rate with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used computer and Placing to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23 years old from Ward Road to Dandi, found himself guilty of the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions of the mortgage on 25 January of this year and not appearing before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Respondent Gregor Sim filed a request not to bring Hogga on the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it can be proved that the crime did not have a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alister Carmaikle postponed the sentence until October, before receiving reports from social services.
Hog was released on bail in this case, but he was detained before hearings in other remaining cases.
It was included in the list of perpetrators of sexual offences before the date of the sentence.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe read the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader of Africa, fell from the stairs leading from the podium this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video with the fall scene spread instantly on social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also embarrassed by statements made by parliamentary oppositioners that they had received anonymous threats warning them against the surgicalization of Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they enlightened the President during his appeal to the nation in Parliament; that was the talk that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
The member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change Innocent Gonesé stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The communication came from a number that was not shown, but it was entitled Death,” he informed journalists at the end of Mugabe's speech.
The members of the Parliament had been warned that the inviolability was ending in the Parliamentary Building, and as soon as they emerged, parliamentary integrity was not in effect.
A member of Parliament stated that the party headed by Morgan Zwangirai was “protected” by the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its programme of restructuring and reduction of service delivery costs.
This same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two registered exchanges by separateing computers and printers from more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job reduction will result in approximately $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, as stated in Hewlett-Packard.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” stated Mag Witman, Chairman and Director General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the portfolio of business directions will be wider and deeper, which will help the company move to a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual benefit of over $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions” to companies, reported in the company's statement.
This is the case with a company formed in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University, Bill Hülett, and Dave Packard, for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called “the place of birth of the Cremni Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world ' s second computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technical companies is the latest development in this sector, based on the belief that the narrow-scape companies work better.
Captain Arsenal, Mikel Arteta, says that his collars should support the injured Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinamo Zagreb.
In a conversation with Wilshire Hunger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that if the restoration of Wilshire was planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to Christmas.
With the most conducive events, Wilshire will miss at least four of the following games in England, and, given the events that occurred, his participation in the European Championship remains under question the next summer.
Most sadly, in this recent problem, Wilshire had confidently completed the previous season with the only ankle trauma and was about to return to a habitual aggressive game during pre-session training.
Hunger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not related to ankles or trauma that he's had before.
These may be related from a medical point of view, but, as Hunger also admitted, there is the risk of additional injuries for any player returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to the report of Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries that had occurred with him during the six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league during the last five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal wider, you can notice that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League Clubs, most of which were lost due to injuries for days.
Hungarian recognizes the likelihood of being stuck in the vicious circle, but in Arsenal, it is believed that improvements in the statistics on injuries will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes, when you're back in the building after the injury, you've been vulnerable for a while -- during that time you need to rebuild your strength and gain a competitive advantage,” said Hunger.
Jack's young enough and he'll be good.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure of it, as well as his career will be the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal is starting a campaign in the League of Champions on Wednesday with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and on the following Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspore and Hunger intends to rotate the composition.
Ector Belierin and Aaron Ramsi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Matié Debushi and Arteta will be in the start-up.
Hunger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Gira in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to the players that need it," said Hunger.
Although Arsenal is unconditional in Group F, the Macymir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most oppressive in Europe.
Dinama has not lost any of the 41 matches since they had the last season as "Unconquerable".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was affected by an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hunger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson learned in the past season when the team was defeated by the Monaco Champion League and remains unlikely to bring the club to the end of the Champion Cup.
"It's an incredible driving," said Hunger.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am a realist for years.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedian show that taught us a lot of men's friendship.
The absence of such stories is being overlooked, especially in view of the desperate need for men for frankness, now more than ever, while the level of suicide among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of the death of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it was three times more frequent with men than with women.
In an effort to address the problem of Kampania v. An accidental life, 2015 was the year of men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
Friendship is at the centre of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression revealed that if a patient has enough friends in a normal mood, the chances of curing are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends doubles the chance of emotional disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it takes her to be.
In an age when communication is managed by social networks, when the style prefers content, the speed of response is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving, and successful, even if there is a real loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely through internal values, our internal aspiration for personal growth and friendship, which has a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as a billionaire recently observed, a video game creator, you're not going to buy more happiness for money.
Friends' dignity is that they're drawing attention to it.
Each character was determined not by his or her work, but rather by a person who showed himself in association with friends.
Jumor Joey and the constant arms of Chandler, the moments of watching soccer on convenient chairs, the rise of Ross on Rachel -- all comes from understanding what men can feel about it, even if they often abstain from a full study of their feelings.
As a Samaritans officer told me, "my role as a listener for people who are depressed and suicidal, emphasizes how even the smallest association of friends can benefit."
Often the men who approach us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old "living with it" teaching is strong, just like the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends are one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer more protracted mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the minor moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a foreign telephone interview helps people in times of desperation, but long-term support comes from a family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central on these weekends, where for the holiday, you've completely reinstated the decorations, why not take your friends to Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see a single person in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Better than ever to guess the benefits that friendship can bring.
Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, on #FriendsFest
De Maria kills her naked, helping the SPG to break the Malmö.
Angel de Maria is equal to Blaise Matudi and Edinson Kavani celebrating slain balls at the Malmö gate.
Angel de Maria, debuting at the Champion League, killed her naked than allowed Malmö to walk around on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kavani did their job when Pari Saint-German started his game in the League of Championes with a very convenient winning 2:0 against Malmö at Park De Prence Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the League of Championes as a SPG player was launched to set the French champions' direction, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Kavani shot his head for the 61st minute.
Along with the Real Madrid and the Do-Net Shachter in Group A, Paris had to take a good start in playing against Sweden's champions because they were targeted not on the qualifications of the plee-off, but on the continuation of a series of successful three seasons, where they reached a quarterthinhal.
They made glasses, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimović to be useless in the attack and later to replace it in the field in the game against a team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or guests at the Champion League, so to win with the number 2:0, deliver problems to the rivals and play a great part in the protection, it's a good start, even if there's still some moments that we're going to need to work out during the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't kill one or two balls more.
Ibrahimović returned after the injury in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her with a number of 2:2 in the Bordo in the First League on the weekend, but he was resigned to the back of D. Maria for four minutes.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the SPG to a new level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United, last month, and he proved why when he ran off Marco Verratti behind the protection of Malmö, and beautifully finished the attack by sending the ball past Yohan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting a light and big victory then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who won the Seltic in the play-off to reach this stage, with nine world-level players at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two protective hemispheres in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nicholas Jurgic's blow, where the ball flew past the long gate of Kevin Trapp at 34 minutes, they attacked a little.
At times, the UFS has led itself to unsuccessful transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimović, who has not been able to perform at least five attempts in the first half, and then failed to process a ball slain by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more skillful in the exact pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimović, which he received, D. Maria sent the ball with a twisted stroke that had passed in the trout of the Mimo Viland for 52 minutes.
The second naked was finally beaten after an hour marking thanks to Kavani, and the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimović set up a ball sent to the center of the field from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the intercept of Viland's ball from a nearby distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before Essejel Lawessi was replaced by the end of the match.
The Malme trainer Ague Hareide later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League was held last December."
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Pari"!
It was a great match with them.

White House confirms the visit of Ci Jingpin to Washington
The White House, on Tuesday, confirmed in an official communication that Head of China Si Jingpin would arrive with an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
This visit, the first visit of Ci Zingpina to Washington, will take place on 25 September and will be a response to the visit of President Barak Obama to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and the first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will also accept Si Jingpina's wife, Pan Liyuan, for the government lunch that day after the two leaders have held bilateral negotiations.

The accident in question occurred on 22 May, about three o'clock in the area of 30 at the Kutuzov Avenue.
The BMW vehicle, driven by Mirsoev, crossed the counter lane and hit a motorcycleist standing on the side.
In 1989, the man died from injuries on the ground.
Friends of the deceased in social networks reported that the BMW driver was driving at a high speed and before the accident left on the counter lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to get out of responsibility, the bikeers arranged a motorway from the Sparrow Mountains to the Moscow HUMWD building on Petrovke, 38.

Over 40 decrees and orders have been signed by Vladimir Yakashev.
Over 40 decrees and orders have been signed by the Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakshev, at the meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Part of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical facilities in municipal education.
In particular, funds are provided for the acquisition of a bus for one of the schools of the Losetaudin district, for the major repair of the district hospital in the Kazan district.
As the accompanying documents indicate, money will be available for the completion of the capital repair of the second floor of the therapeutic office.
The hot and cold water, water, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, building facades will be renovated, firefighting and energy conservation activities will be implemented.
The second Forum of the Russian and Belarus regions will be held in Sochi.
The second Forum of the Russian and Belarus regions will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, in which the Tumen delegation will be chaired by the Governor.
The forthcoming Sochi event and the intermediate outcome of cooperation are described by the honourable Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni Vladimir Schugla, a formal delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the challenges of the so-called forum?
The large Sochi event reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on fruitful cooperation among the regions - important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are scheduled to attend the plenary meeting.
The plenary and sectional meetings will address the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, legal and regulatory policies and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen region will address the forum.
I think that is evidence of the successful, sustained interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
Representatives of key ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will work.
I hope that the Forum will help to enter into new favourable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first similar meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including 19 Russian regions, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minsk Areas has been signed.
The importance of our advances is also indicated by the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumen at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, identifying additional links and organizing new agro-industry investment projects.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with Governor Vladimir Yakshev, Governor of Tumen, referred to the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult circumstances.
The supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of cars for the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Belshin trade house and options for the prevention of loss.
Matters are important, as investment projects should work clearly and profit the region.
The further shipments of OAO “MAZ” passenger cargo equipment were referred to as the development of the OAO service centre “MAZ”, which was established in Tumen on the OAO-TAP base.
The discussion also covered the preparation of the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the year.
Another theme of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation in the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relationships promises to go to a new level.
These were also related to the district centre.
During a meeting with the head of the administration of Tumani, Alexander Moor, we talked about the updating of the Tumen bus park.
Approximately 100 buses are already “drinking on ladans”, so a new shipment of cars from Belarus that will work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tuman elevator plant collaborates with one of the leading elevators of the OAU “Magylylliftmash”, receiving the kitting.
In my view, these activities could be more active given the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
In addition, a meeting was held within the framework of the extended powers of the consul with the Governor of the Kurgan Province, Alexei Cocorin, during which the issue of increased trade and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaurala was discussed.
At the end of September, a meeting with the Omie Governor is scheduled.
The enlarged consular district is composed of five RF entities, but the Tumen is a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a polygon for many promising projects, including the work of an honorary genconsul.
Generally speaking, such meetings are important and good, which enables many problems to be addressed directly and quickly, with their sharpening and mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the hurdle by continuing to work forward.
Matt Damon against focusing attention on the ethnic diversity of people engaged in film production
Matt Damon argued with Effie Brown's producer Efie Brown, claiming that there is no need to take into account ethnicity.
During the Sunday release of the Project Greenlight on HBO channel, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the project scenario.
"People are appropriate when you're making tapes for the movie itself, not for the show," insisted Damon.
Crazy Brown, with no faith in her ears, resentedly shouted "Wow!
In order to discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown joined the producers of Ben Afflek and the brothers of Farelli.
"I would like the participants, no matter who the director, to think about the interpretations of the Harmoni image they are going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute that is beaten by a white pimp.
The film producer Dear White People advocated for Leo Angeles and Christine Brancaccio to be the directors of the film; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "We can eventually get not what we want."
After the discussion was displayed on television, social networks exploded by ungrateful comments to Damon.
The Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "The explanation of the substance of diversity from Matt Damon is the only black man in the room is THAT THAT THlE THAT is hurt."
Tweet's got over 5,000 rhevites and 4,000 sticks.
Damon's expressions appear just when the literal presentation of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by the police in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, calling on legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the color population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of the applicants at the Grammy Awards Ceremony at Albe Year.
"Alboms still matter," he said.
Like books and lives of black people, albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued a formal statement in response to a member of Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbek ' s question as to whether the group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," reported the leaders of the movement.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business, producers and media magnates invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior awards the first champion
A professional scramble and an assistant officer, Izek Kaldierro, became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home the prize of $1 million.
On this sports show, whose 7th season just ended, no participant was able to pass all stages of the hurdle.
At the end of the season, two participants, Caldero and Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task included a 75-foot rope upwards in 30 seconds.
Brytten did his job first and put himself in the right time, becoming the first athlete in the history of American Ninja Warrior, in the exhaustive phase 4, but Kaljero did a task for three seconds faster, making it a winner.
After winning the hard work, Caldero, who was shocked that he won a million dollars, gave an interview "E!News."
"To think about it is incredibly, I've never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year," I commented to Eyzek journalists!
And all of a sudden... I never even imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
The executive producer, Kent Wid, met the Hollywood Reporter journalists to talk about the finale and why Britten, who first passed the road, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
"If the Finishers are more than one player, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Wid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes in life, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about it.
He is happy with what he did.
He got tons of feminine feedback from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff said to me, "if I was supposed to lose someone, I'm glad it's Izek."
And I think that Izek would have felt the same if we had changed our roles.
The "America Ninja Warrior" is coming back with the eighth season, which will start filming in the spring of 2016.
"Detrot Tygers" is quietly surrounded by Minnesot Twins.
MINEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't especially fun for Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, "Tygers" is now the last one in the Central Division of the American League.
Just claiming to be an obstacle, Taigers wins on Tuesday at Minnesot Twins with 5-4 to Targent Field.
Twins missed the chance to reduce the Houston Astros half-play backwards and to take the second place in the Flee-Off, by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroitians, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped off most of the second half of the season.
"All the winners are fun, no matter how they get," said Brad Osmus, manager.
Petecher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made a contribution in support of attacks, resulting in Detroit recruited three points in the first two innings, then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a 6,1/3 inning pitcher and he missed three wounds.
It was only his third qualitative start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers aren't able to throw in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martínez, targeted Tygers, was able to beat three strikes and achieved two wounds - the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three blows since the four strikes in the game against Sittle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked a good bit," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in the (batter's quality), noticeably better in the battle work, and preserved this quality for the game.
Taking three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got his best chance to go back to the game.
Central receiver of Bayron Baxton opened inning with the field on the left line.
Rytfielder Aaron Hicks took the first base, and the second Braceman Brian Dozier got a strike-out from Simon before he took his seat on the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy's gone by Moer, the only player on the way, before the newly appointed reflector Miguel Sano, who hit two-rane "single" on the left of the right-hand Dru Verhagen.
In the early vapour pair, it was not in the autumn and comparing the wound on the second base of Ver Hagen that led the third baseman, Trevor Pluffa, to be beaten in the dable-fly.
It was the 27th time for the lead player to the top league in this season when Pluff hit a ball on a dable-glass.
After Detroit added insured wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI as a “dabble” space between the autfielders against the Tigers Covering Aider Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the provincial player killed Sano after three strikes and received his fifth safe.
Detroit took advantage of a non-practicable Phil Hughes at the beginning of the game.
Tigers made three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved drinker who was on the list of traumatized before the game itself, lacking more than a month in connection with the inflammation of the leaflet.
"Surely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game develops, I feel more comfortable, so I've been able to do some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first better got to the first base, Hughes threw off his second baseman, Ian Kinsler.
Woke, on two utilities of Raitfielder J. D. Martinezu, brought Victor Martinez, who made a synthesis in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series of "0 for 21" with the early men in an effective position.
The player of the third base, Nick Castelianos, followed the single by another wound, but Victor Martinez was beaten in an attempt to get closer to the third base, thus eliminating the threat.
Taigers increased the account in the second inning by receiving a one-auto-dubble from James McCann's Quarter and a two-a-a-witched "single" of the central reflecting Anthony Goose, and it became 3-0.
"It was a powerful whit," said Paul Moletor's manager.
He wasn't especially good, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, whose ankles were thought to be thrown into the unsubstantiated third inning, was then replaced by the provincial Reliver, A. J. Ahter.
Hughes numbered three wounds on six whits and a glass with four rat strikes.
NOTES: Pitcher-Righter Taigers Anibal Sanches has left the players in connection with the breaking of the right shoulder.
He's going to be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who was doing Sanches' operation on his shoulder in 2007.
Sánchez, on the list of traumatized since mid-August, is scheduled to leave the start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the Pitcher-Lesch Daniel Norris will leave the list of trauma victims and go out against Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers at four starts since his acquisition in exchange for the Pitcher-Left David Price on 30 July, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He has not participated in games since 20 August because of the slanting muscle.
The Taigers and Twins will complete a series of three games on the Targent Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) Citder-Rur Erwin Santan will play (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of the complaint of Cadirov, under the book Molba to God, went to the South Sahelian Court.
The City Court of South Sahaline received an original appeal from the representative of President Chechny Ramsan Kadirov on the decision to recognize the “Ecthremist material” of the book “Moleb to God: its significance and place in Islam”, reports Interfax with reference to the chairman of the Hill of Alexander Chuhrai.
The Court is awaiting possible objections to the proceedings.
Chuhrai refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the Home Office of the RF on the need to verify the harbour for possible cooperation with foreign special servants and IGIL.
"Say it yourself to comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the City Prosecutor ' s Office of South Sahaline filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natali Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The Office of the Public Prosecutor of South Sahalinsk received an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the Public Prosecutor considers that they have asked the court to recognize extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not the Ayahs of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the judge has taken the wrong decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the quotations of the Qur'an were called "We worship you, and We pray to You for help," "Do not call upon anyone besides Allah."
Cadirov called the decision-makers on the book "schitans and provocators."
He called on the Deputies of the House to prohibit legally judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the Lord must adopt a law prohibiting judicial action concerning the texts of the Koran and other divine Scriptures,” wrote Cadirov in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Faisbuk staff intend to remove posts and comments that provide a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
The social network will also provide financial support to organizations that gather user complaints of wrongful content.
To combat xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook leadership intends to work with the German Ministry of Justice.
For example, the former head of the Haiko Maas department stated that the Minust, together with the social network specialists, is currently working on the creation of a special group of engineers.
Its participants are required to monitor and remove non-correct comments on migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, the authors of non-tolerant posts are expected to receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
The operational blocking of wrongful content should also be facilitated by organizations whose professionals are engaged in collecting complaints of insults from users.
The management of Facebook intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments on migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after xenophobic sentiments had increased dramatically in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that had covered the European Union some time ago.
Thus, Germany has already overcrowded all locations for refugees.
The country's prior authorities had decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced displaced persons from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
The Moscow cemeteries will have relaxed zones.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries are equipped with specialized zones for relaxing and psychological rest.
The first will be the Bhutovsky, Domodedovskaya, and Czerbin cemetery.
The first area for psychological recreation has already emerged on the Troekurov cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will continue to occur in other parts of the city.
This portal m24.ru was described by Artem Ekim, head of the State Budget Institute, Ritual.
Relaxation zones will represent small greenlands that resemble parks.
In the opinion of experts, visitors of the cemeteries will be able to rest, stay alone and rebuild psychological forces in such “holes. ”
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsky, Bhutov and Zerbin cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the head of the GHS, Ritual, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to maintain the existing forests to the maximum extent possible.
Green plants will serve as a living fence that will separate recreational zones and areas directly under burial sites.
The HBU experts Ritual also expressed their intention to propose no burial fences.
New cemeteries can really become barier.
In addition, Ritual reported on its readiness to install electronic terminals to enable cemetery visitors to identify GPS coordinates and safety plates.
In June this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of funeral services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So the digging of the tomb in summertime would cost a thousand roubles cheaper, a week of winter when the earth was frozen.
In the past year, the cost of all ritual services traveled an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the elynine forest.
The elderly man was alive, although he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forests without any vigilance.
Rescue and volunteer efforts have led to the discovery of a grim scourge.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tamba region spent five days in the forest."
No food and water.
He was searched by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even movies with dogs, but there wasn't any results.
The man was found after the helicopter was connected to the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrović, as usual, went to the woods behind the oranges and chests, but he didn't return by evening.
The relatives immediately sought help, and the next day, rescuers and uneven residents from a neighboring village were raised to search for a fungus.
They were joined by a fire and rescue helicopter for five days.
Andrey Seletov, chief of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "Vertolet was attracted, the man was discovered."
He's gone very far, completely different.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search site.
He's gone a long distance at his age.
The miracle is alive.
The mushroom was taken to the Ellen Central District Hospital without consciousness, in extremely difficult condition.
Medicines diagnosed his pneumonia as well as severe dehydration and refrigeration.
As an elderly man survived five days in the woods, doctors do not know at all.
Valentine Nepsha, leader of the Elnis CRB's therapeutic office, "Patience, treatment is scheduled."
Infusion therapy, anti-bacterial.
Bearing in mind all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, still difficult, but with a positive momentum.
Vitaly Alexandrović pensioner travels each year to Smollencin from the Tamba region.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to collect mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found fungi, said, "Les near the road, it's not in principle local."
For a few years, I was visiting my relatives.
Well, I went after the mushrooms.
I guess I'm going a long way and I'm lost.
Since the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In just the last few days, five similar cases.
Savings remind you of the need to walk into the forest in bright clothing, with little food, beverages, and compass.
It is also desirable to leave traces so that you can return.
An Accidental An-2 sat on a crossing in a brotherly tip.
Right on the crossing in Siberia, an emergency an-2.
An emergency landing aircraft from the red-sea Air Force, Enice, took 68 kilometres away from Bratsk.
There are no dead and victims, but the aircraft itself has received significant damage when landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
On board, there were three crew members, a commander, a second pilot and aboard mechanics, reports Interfax.
An accident aircraft flyed over the railway line of the Irelyarsk-Ilimsk, Acinsk, where the airline is based.
The aircraft's crew is already shipped to Brothersk.
The Brother Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with the law on flight safety.
The East Siberian Transport Prosecution Investigation Group has left the scene.
In September 2010, the Tou-154 crew planted its aircraft with passengers because of technical failures for the abandoned clandestine airfield in Komi.
Engines and on-board electronics were denied on the liner, but the crew did not.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board the aircraft.
No one was injured at the emergency landing.
Essentials of the Economic Commission for Europe Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes had to contribute to the reduction of inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in income in developing economies is increasing.
Eric Masskin.
To that end, the education of low-qualified workers needs to be improved, considers Eric Maskin, the Chief Research Officer of the International Research and Decision-making Laureate of the Nobel Economy Prize.
The world has experienced the unprecedented growth of global markets in the past twenty years.
Commercial borders between countries were becoming increasingly open.
Globalization advocates predicted great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," emphasizes Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious per capita growth in GDP.
But it's not so cheerful.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “poor” and the “inexperienced” in poor countries, which was expressed in a large income inequalities, and, more precisely, wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Erik Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Decreased Inequalities in Developing Economies”, published in the World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by the WEEE.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Cremer Eric Maskin, of the University of Harvard, developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the difference in income in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, resembles NIEW.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin is providing four qualifications for the wealthy countries, the C and the D for the poor.
Following globalization, experts from poor countries D lacked a level of qualifications to cooperate with experts A and B from rich countries.
And if employees at the C level have increased their wages by cooperating with staff members of the wealthy, they do not feel the growth of the D employees or their wages are falling.
The result is that the internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, the increase in inequalities.
The Cremer and E. Masskin are offered an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricordian comparative advantage theory.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequalities, says Fuad Alesskerov, a professor in charge of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-making, head of the Department of Mathematics of the WSHE.
And as a powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Erik Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, according to the scholar, do not have the means to do so, and companies do not benefit from their training.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private funds can play a significant role, Maskin believes.
The scholar notes that the theory is in no way called for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produces its fruits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: live communication in time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities of Russia, observes its 2000th anniversary in September.
The holidays programme is a festival of the national cultures of the Dagestan peoples and a fair in the way of past times, a exhibition of derbent carpets and a Day of Open Temples, a two-hour historical and musical show and a tour of the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Average stones of the Narin-Kala fortification, old Arab inscriptions on walls, narrow streets and palace gardens, all of which kind of went off the pages of Tishichi and one night.
Derbent is the only city of Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Vizantia, the Khanat of Kazar, and the Golden Ord.
The age of East Plain, growing in the derbent Juma Mechesta courtyard, is a number of centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian Days - Wildlife Monuments programme.
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
The mosque visitor will have a fragrance of tea, and will eat Dahhestan sweats: honey-fisher, hurma, musmulah, vulture, garland, and sweetness.
In Derbenta, the spock of the centuries is used by large self - cooks to drink teas of many guests at one time.
A label above the entrance to Juma Mechet says the building was built in the year 115 of the Hijra.
I mean, in 733 on the Grigory calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is amazed by the scale and solemnity: the arcades of the domes and convoys are based on square convoys and beams of the sun from small windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is the traditional attraction of the residents of Derbent.
Housebird owners put pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, on the mountains.
A fascinating sight is a glitter of white pigeons like the outbreaks of a feasting firework.
For defence from an enemy, the ancient Persians overtook the Caspian gate with a double stone wall.
It was a 500 - foot - long [500 m] journey in the sea that blocked the Derbent harbor.
In 2003 the Derbent walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortress.
The carpets in Derbent were still fabricated in the fifth century, and so far the technology of this unique trade has remained virtually unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city’s market, carpets are sold to any taste, such as wool palas, cotton, or foam of all colors and shadows, vorse and noon, with complex ornaments and fascinating potassium.
The construction of the city began with the districts with one - story stone buildings.
Over the years, the domes have almost changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls, and street lamps remind you that you are not in a medieval city but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the parts of the pipeline built by the Persians were preserved about a thousand years ago.
Ancient sources have reached our day, where the locals still collect water today.
Many derbentists prefer the usual water from cranes from tested historical fountains.
In Derbent, there was one of the pottery crafts centers.
Polish and charter vases, dishes, jewels, cups were valued for all the Caucasus.
The handes of the potters are still making fine ceramic products, both practical and souvenir-purpose.
In the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators are gathered under the tightened rope at which the students of the Republican Circus School are present.
The history of amazing and risky skills has been a number of centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the canaanists.
The former Virgin's Banny's office today is the Culture and Home of the Ancient Derbent Museum.
In the past, unmarried girls and brides were washed here, accompanied by friends, and now anyone who wants to see a packed hall, hot and cold basins that went past bathing supplies.
Most of the Derbent houses have hot water, but the banni and the lads are popular today as in the past.
The benefits of warming are found in ancient books.
After the bath, the muscles get better, they lose their fatigue, the body becomes flexible and easy.
The Constituency festival, which takes place in the Narin Kala Strength, is attended by ethnopods of many Dagestan areas.
Participants in national suits dance, play popular tunes, perform songs of the Caucasus peoples, and feed visitors with good home cheese.
Cyrchlar is the place of burying forty martyrs who have headed for Islam.
This is one of the most honored complexes for Muslims in the Northern Caucasus.
The sarcophagies that have been fired from time to time have been cut out of whole stone blocks and have been directed, as Arabs have adopted, to the western axis.
Gavriel and Albert Yakubov’s brothers stroke and bury customers in a small cabin near the Upper Market.
The parrot is in this place for many years.
Curriculum receptions are transferred from generation to generation.
At the same time, Yakubov’s brothers can do not only the traditional but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house was preserved with a Caucasus-based decabrist, Alexander Bestujev-Marlinski.
After studying the Turkic language and compiling the ethnographic material, he described Derbent’s first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, lives, and households.
Chichana is a traditional East club, where only tea and home cooking are given.
Men come here to satisfy their thirst, to communicate with their friends, and to solve some working problems.
As in the past, women are not advised to cross the threshold of the tea.
The Derbent Danes ensemble “Cassium” was established three years ago, but has already been able to participate in the activities of the Republic and Russian levels.
The solicitors are rehearsing every day, perfectly exploring people's accidents, Dargins, Tatian, Armenian dancing.
As the evening arrives, when noise weathers and street lights ignite, local residents settle on benches near houses with terraces.
Typically, derbents are discussing household issues.
But in the jeopardy of the anniversary, they are increasingly remembering the unique history of their city, which has affected the fate of the entire Black Sea-Capesian region.
A business game at the airport was held in Domoded.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried to serve as airport staff.
To that end, the three airplane models were built in Domodedov.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers but also maintained aircraft.
It's all in the form of a business game, but it's difficult not to give up.
The late flights, two passengers with breaks on board, were lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the real airport, Hell.
For the one founded in Domodeda, a standard set of tasks to be resolved by newcomers.
Three large airports from around the world were placed in a single hangar.
They now have four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
It's an unprecedented chance to learn all about the internal world of air gambling.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of aircraft, traffic of luggage - they were even entrusted to buses in the summer field, trains and passenger inspections.
And the passengers are really troublesome.
One inconvenience with the documents, another late on the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to figure this out, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, it has a certain amount, virtual money, as if it had been paid by the airlines for the maintenance of the flight.
"For their failure to perform their tasks, a fine is being imposed," explains the Vesty-Mosqua financial analyst of the Dmitry Hilko game.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely following the situation.
For them, this examination is an attempt to test a new form of education.
She has already found a place in secondary vocational education.
“There will be six interregional competencies that will, in fact, become new models for modern colleges with a modern management system, with high-skilled staff, with modern equipment”, reports the Director of the Department of Public Policy in the areas of training of workers and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Natal Goldarev.
But students aren't into global plans.
After three days of training, they might need a weekend.
The evaluation for this examination had a very material expression.
The newest smart kids, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport claim," is pleased with the participant in the game, the director of the Frankfurt Airport, Sergei Schiovov.
The best judges, called judges, were taken to the pencil to invite them to work at the time of completion.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature of the American Centre at the Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Embassy Centre at the M.I.Rudomino Global State Library in Moscow.
“Unilateral steps taken by the RF recently challenge the Russian Government's commitment to the Russian-American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments of the long history of our countries' relations,” says the U.S. Ambassador John Tefft, who entered Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and lasting links between the people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a place for meetings with many American eminent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Centre conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities and hosted over 50,000 Russian visitors,” stressed the diplomat.
Tufft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX education exchange programme (Future Leaders Exchange Programme).
The Green Tribunal was soon to be executed.
Typical situation: Four officials are at the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, hearing his claims for the work done.
The Court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We have not given you a 110-page order so that you may be sore of him,' says Cumar.
If one more brick is put on, we'll have to destroy all the buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NLB), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by the turbulent economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had before it more than 10,000 cases of air pollution, debris collection, geological development, toxic waste and dump construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: over the under-60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has turned from the country of the virgin jungle to one of the most populated and contaminated countries in the world.
Particularly serious is the problem in major megapolis where infrastructure development does not scour for rapid urbanization: cities are covered with density, rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes by enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are cut out under construction by new housing blocks.
Despite the State ' s formal support for the green movement, the NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the abolition of major investment projects.
In May this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court's decisions “extreme” and “incompliant”.
Sometimes the court ' s decisions are not really possible to be enforced within the court ' s deadline, confirming the environmental counsel of Raj Panjwani.
However, unfulfilled delineations have a positive side: at least they make responsible persons move.
"He's the main goal of overthrowing this system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has already cancelled large constructions on several occasions, with an end to the construction of airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller facilities.
In doing so, they also try to keep in mind, for example, the fate of the pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which contaminated the local river.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," commented Kumar's decision.
Such explanations, however, are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives can change because of one pepper of the judiciary.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital rather than to resent the general public.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to rescind the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Delhi statistics on the travelling and exit transport and also proposed to purchase 10,000 additional buses in advance in the factories as to whether they were in a position to do that.
As the courts began to be exposed to pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents, people's anger began to slow down.
But the most sick subject of the Principal Judge was the Ganges Cleaning Programme, with the Pope announced by Prime Minister Narendrai Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, a sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often stops controlling his emotions and goes into screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of Ganges into the statue of God, and there were fecalations in it, and the judge was hot.
You keep contaminating the river because you think Ganges is Ganges, he'll take all our sins.
It's the river we worship, and look what you're doing to her every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new Government.
At present, the number of fecal bacteria in the river exceeds the rate of more than 120 times.
Every year, 1.5 million to 3 of the 700 million Indian bathers die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund for the sale of his costume, where he met Barak Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists immediately accused the Prime Minister of populism: a costume was purchased for $700,000, while at least eight billion were needed to clean up the river.
The Green Tribunal concurred that India had a long way to go before it could call itself a developed country, but did not believe that the ecology should be the price of progress.
"In a developing country, environmental conversations are often perceived as an inconsistent luxury, says the Ganges activist Malik Bhanot.
And the court seeks to find a golden middle between ecology and development."
The man blew a couple of Dali paintings at the Riga exhibition.
A visitor to the Latin Union of artists in Riga broke the windows in the museum and sculpted El Salvador Dali's "Angle Bearing" sculpture.
The Museum is now carrying out an exhibition of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.

Si Jinpine calls for the economy to be more open to peace
The economy must become more open to the world to push its growth, as President Ci Jinpinh said on Tuesday in addressing the group with the task of steering reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open-source policy,” he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Lead Group on Comprehensive Reform.
He said that expanding openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and life force and would provide a new space for economic development.
The Lead Group has adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of market access for investors, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and the revising of the registration system.
It is stated that a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually adjusted through test programmes.
This is an important step, since it will play a more important role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control of the power of companies, thus guaranteeing that companies themselves will run their own business.
The statement also stated that China would allow the border regions to explore new transboundary economic cooperation models and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of the sub-government sectors of the economy.
“The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide them with better conditions,” the statement states.
Additionally, the application for permanent residence for foreigners, or “grin-card”, will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Ketzan and Ministers Liu Yungshang and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
