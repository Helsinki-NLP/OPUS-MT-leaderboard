Parliament does not support the amendment to freedom of Timoschenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of the amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected the attempt to abolish the article which condemned the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoschenko.
An amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister ' s prison was rejected during the second reading of the bill on the commutation of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be inappropriate.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will review the Timoshenko appeal in December.
Timothychenko claims that the sentence is the political venue of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspicious of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has the losers.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert, and the war ended without him.
It's time to determine the winners.
In general, Islamists prevail in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of Shariah's customary law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, as the penalty for theft is the siege of the hand.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society composed of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be a order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which is unlikely to wish.
In any event, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and most likely to be approached, for example, the Libyan population.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted assistance from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that NATO was not guided by the U.S. General, but Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every blow.
And if Libya seeks winners, the West is not among them.
We took part in the shootings, served as Islam, and our policies were rid of the dictator, their political allies, without any guarantee of the benefit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, should not worry about the expulsion of the Crestonorists.
Although without occupation, will the oil companies receive the black gold of Libya for almost an invaluable price?
And then the West will finally be able to relieve itself of unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Shariah end this.
A New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are now focusing on investors.
The static storm was over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, Germany and France showed growth.
Still, the debt market is hitting record today.
Investors are already not only looking towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Eurason Statistical Offices in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have issued their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP rose by 0.5 per cent expected; France was 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted the data for the second quarter in which the cases were better than expected in Germany (0.3 per cent instead of original 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decrease of 0.1 per cent (initial information was expected to be stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, GDP was stagnant compared to the previous quarter, and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed the tendency to slow down economic growth in a gradual manner.
The results were worse than predicted by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both Euroson and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with analyst projections.
Greece ' s economy has shown a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium are beginning to face difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the income of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech Assembly was screened in the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million prize.
The national team has successfully handled the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful naked of Peter Yirachek, they defeated with an account 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team had been happily able to maintain a significant advantage after the domestic response match, and it would again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and produced a detailed report.
Practically nothing significant in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech national assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Chech; and the heroic Yirach; winning 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrating the exit to the European Championship.
The great defense of the Czech team allowed Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianović and Vucnić became the most unsuccessful match after they missed two wonderful opportunities.
Brilliant Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech national assembly won't miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football will earn some 200 million Czech kroner.
Since the first minutes, the game has been very tense.
Both teams had difficulty in combining; the game went most of the time at the centre of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure from the host team in the first time, and further blows for the defence line were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a live shield.
Several hundred university students have established a live shield around an atomic power plant in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday, the moleque followed the deaths of both the United States and Israel in the morning, following the students' prayers in front of the entrance.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have established a live shield around the Isfahan Uranium enrichment factory.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme at the expense of their own lives.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all indicated that Iran had not abandoned its attempts to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, a moleque for the death of both the United States and Israel followed on the afternoon of the students' prayers before entering the Isfahan Uranium enrichment factory.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralyzing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives would be, according to the Israeli press, the installations in both Isfahan and Natanza, where uranium enrichment was carried out.
Children with obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than a third of the children aged between 9 and 13 are weighing more; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children with obesity usually come from unhealthy families.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and models of conduct associated with man for his or her healthy development.
For example, the cobbass is almost twice as frequent on tables of children with obesity as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity ate for the meal of fry potato fri on the eve of the educational event called Obesity is not accidental.
Moreover, the families of children with obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern schoolchildren -- only 15 per cent of the children said that their parents were finding time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was carried out at the end of the last school year, with nearly 900 elementary students throughout Bohemia participating.
Obesity is not an accident of the second consecutive year, with the support of the Všeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and Unilever insurance company.
To date, over 12,000 students in grades 4 to 8 have joined the project.
The right food and sufficient sporting load are the main determining factors that cause a rapidly growing number of children who suffer either from excessive weight or from obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said that they were eating five times a day, according to the breakfast-consumption-recussion-winning scheme, which is one of the indispensable conditions of proper nutrition,” says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even relative aspects of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of the families of schoolchildren have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has separate breakfast.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't have breakfast at all.
Still, breakfast is the basis of a proper day’s diet.
The study found that razor food is more common in families with children with obesity.
Almost everyone, regardless of weight, drinks sweet cool drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, the figure declines more than twice to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were invited to form their own menus on the basis of proposed products and on their tastes and preferences.
“Preventions in food in Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal with regard to healthy nutrition.”
Their favorite food includes a large number of martyrs, meats, and sweet foods.
“Specific alarm is the popularity of sweet cool drinks,” says the final part of the study.
As the main meal, the pasta won a small - scale bird.
However, children had little or no interest in beans, fish, and vegetables.
Determined to a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided they were provided with information.
“Many participants in the research control team have shown a significant shift in the preferences towards healthy food when filling the questionnaire after the lecture is done, is not accident,” the outcome of the project.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks -- more children have taken advantage of just water.
In addition, as a basic meal, children often observed birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet foods and bakings.
Stilist must also be a good psychologist, professors claim.
In the first article on stylist training, I made a statement on the amount of information in the introduction sessions.
I had no idea what was going on.
Lectures of three experts in this area; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Further, more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical tasks are expected.
The training is going on every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time with Alenka, director, (no man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One short neck, another baby figure without proper shape, weighs another more norm.
The firm must know how to narrow the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add missing volumes.
We have been given advice on how to highlight the figure of women like Jennifer Lopes, that is, possessors of more splendid breasts and thighs and narrow tales, and not wearing them too provoked.
For example, if the difference in the size of the talium and the thigh is so large that you can't pick up the skirt or the trousers, you should have at least one thing to order.
You're obviously not going to regret what you're wearing, because perfectly sitting clothes are invaluable.
In the skirt you'll feel a lot better than the one who's constantly driving, rolling, naking, etc.
Boys, on the other hand, may wear clothing with rubber, application, sewing or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant in the course had to invent two outs for any celebrity: day and evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style of clothing and the type of figure.
I have to put Miranda Carr on something you can know about Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I rejoice in myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spirs, Christina Aguiler, who has recently recovered for a ton.
We have to cut the clothes out of the magazines or find them online, print and process using graphic programs.
Mudbord -- so called the result of work -- then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It's important to keep the graphic composition of the style in mind.
Stilist does not just dress real people, but produces products in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenic told us.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist Needs General Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, which was filled with information about the types of figures, was reinvigorated by three visitors, specialists in this field.
Stilist, Honza Submissives; fashion designer, Yakub Polanka; and fashionable photographer Ben Rench.
Yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a styleist should use the fact.
A good stylist can use one piece of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-train can be worn normally above jeans and shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without tracks like a dress.
Another possibility is to roll a sleeve or lift a collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Hey, play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them, 'Jakub told us.
Here I finally understand why we're dentisting all the definitions and rules that combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we're often seeing quite different things.
Not to mention the fashionable show.
Ben, a photographer, I found out that the stylist must have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs.
So, for a fashion review on 10 pages (equivalent to ten outer garments) I should be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the picture, the object of clothing often looks and works together with others in a way that's different from the reality.
We should have that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Poкорna confirmed that often image and style were half of success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing fibre, but her image and marketing turned it into a world star.
The relationship to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even known people often think it's too much (and believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something, or what they look like is second.)
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different size than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about some celebrity of the celebrity of the celebrity of the celebrity of the troustle, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that the stylist was not sufficient to understand the fashion and to be able to pick out his outer garments.
Our work mainly consists of dealing with the people we dress; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them or to maintain their opinions.
"If the manager requests you to examine her clothes and add some beautiful things, you cannot throw out all her wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible."
"Leave for at least a few things that you can commend, and suggest that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the working bag should be placed specifically.
It's the bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky straps or English snails, it should contain neurons (the neurons use them when taking some items, such as bags or hats), special ticks for tissuing tissues on the back if the cloth is too large (the plates and similar items are prohibited because they are powdering clothing) or a set for sewing.
To get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we've learned to make the right tips on the shoes.
Even during the studio survey, where the floor is smooth, the pods can be damaged, not to mention the street photographs.
And here we've taken a stick.
You don't have to touch the shoe with scissors so you don't screw them up.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario commended my work.
I didn't like the skills I mentioned.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist is not easy no matter what you say.
V Need for Speed: Running in America.
Overview
What was supposed to be a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and negligent mistakes.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but that is not important, since no one obviously wanted to do a job.
Prior to the new version with the subheading “Feed”, there were great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As it often happens with NFS, the result is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is a few unnecessary mistakes that have been made in this series of games for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplainable lens of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of the story, whose chief hero, Jack, solves some personal problems by engaging in an illegal race across America.
You go to a car on the western coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York.
That idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of 10 stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race is travelling along its own route, and the individual stages are taking place in a different and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the game is going on all the time.
Although the timetable is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, some roads are enjoyable.
Still, the game does not cause strong emotion.
Although driving the car through the desert, the autumn suburbs, or high in snowy mountains, are enjoyable.
Besides, the race sometimes revitalizes the unusual detail.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandy storm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, we need to be careful in the mountains to avoid falling under the line.
Individual races are quite well streamlined.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a time, you're trying to screw up a few rivals (in fact, a regular race); then you're trying to improve time (the standard race with a seconds) or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you sometimes face the police, which makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack runs away from someone most of the time and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's nothing difficult.
Although it's surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
It actually turns out that it's good for the game because it's not annoying; given the above, it's one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The racing model follows previous models.
This means that it no longer constitutes something special, but it cannot be considered a shortage.
If you're looking for a real life simulation, you're going to have to find another place.
Nevertheless, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, it's very good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike driving models, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect such a game to change and collision, but if you don't know before the clash with the object, how your car behaves, something's wrong.
Normally, by running or passing by cars in a tight stream, you sometimes touch a little bit about another car, but sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car starts freaking out.
Or it's broken.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you break or go far from the road, the game returns you to the point where it interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start a race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes you do not have enough restartings, and you have to call on a separate part of the race.
The important lack of play is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be taken in a certain way, or you just won't get happier.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a specific location in the same configuration, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your rival pass easily between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you get there, the cars are already positioned to either drive them or drop speed.
It doesn't matter when you're close to them; everything's arranged that the situation always happens just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find a few places where, regardless of time, the same rival is provoking you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand in front of you in spite of nothing.
The fact is, when he's in front of you, he's deteriorating your review, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it starts to get annoyed.
It's a pity, because despite the simple driving pattern, the game is interesting and sometimes so saturated by events that you don't have time to look at what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what makes you miss -- the concept of fivety unique roads, the sequence of races, or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations on the road, because it is them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is sufficient.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports are suitable for cities; powerful American cars - for straight lines of highways; and exotic super-softers for technical driving, for example, on outstretched mountain tracks.
The main mode of history mode is closely linked to the challenge mode mode; it is the individual section race you learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and glasses common to the challenges and the story.
Many opportunities are available to obtain higher driving levels, ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and makes public contact.
Here is another weakness that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the tunnel of the subway (to be counted as yes) where you travel through the rails in the dark (to be counted as such).
Your spidometer shows the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (to be counted as yes) when suddenly the train of the subway hits you, turning your car into the chest of scrap metal.
For a few days, our edition has been discussing whether at the time of creating a game, no one has ever thought, or its creators really think we're such an idiot.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the general impression of the video is mostly pleasant, sometimes even impressive.
Although it is regrettable that in some critical moments the quality of the record is declining, sometimes quite severe.
This is especially true in cases involving a large number of participants, where a good recording would not be especially helpful to you.
The sound is fine; the sound is for the amateur.
To please the widest youth audience, the Saudtrek has come up with different styles; but it is unlikely that many will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The escape is quite unmanageable.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that running is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a sense of incompletement.
Of course, it's a good fun, but prepare for the shortcomings that will blind you as a searchlight at the airport.

Ambassador Vicenova to the EU:
In the Czechs, the reputation of unfavoured persons and skeptics towards the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable differences between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a violent war."
"Five or six years before the situation stabilizes, it will calm down and all players will get used to their new roles," Ambassador Milena Vizenov of the EU rigidly started his lecture at the legal faculty.
It has proved to the extent that it adheres to its “Light and Openly on Europe” in the first part of its lecture, where it described the individual EU agencies and their relationships as simple and clear that many lecturers from the Legal Faculty would be obscure.
Moreover, Vizenova commended the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Romanpei:
"The critics said he was a regular gray office mouse, which cannot perform any role; I must say everyone was surprised at how well he did his role."
"He's a man who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, and he's good at communicating with them, and he has a clear understanding of the EU's way to develop."
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security issues as the answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; as an important step towards the unification and transparency of the Union ' s policy towards such countries as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
The focus was further on a programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the success of Czech presidency in the past year.
The Czech Republic had dealt with the impending financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and organized the East Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech people in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the chairman and the subsequent financial crisis have led to ongoing drowsing.
Furthermore, the new seven-year EU budget must be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, what areas would be preferred; what countries would receive greater support and what less; all those issues in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador reminded the key slogans she brought to Brussels, "O Europe, in Clear Language."
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words, and the jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens realize that people in Brussels do not try to sell curves or round round rounds, bananas of different sizes, or that someone's going to ban our cheese class.
It is also going to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs in European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered to be Euroskeptics; as well as people who are more negative than positive aspects of things.
She wanted more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
It believes that this is the responsibility of several factors: for example, the modestness of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of the Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Vichegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the words are joined by us, a Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, for what reason is the meeting again, the Vichegrad group?" and he's not happy at all."
In the future, Vizenov expects mostly new strict rules for the budget policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of two-speed Europe to be more realistic, if not multi-speed Europe.
"We have both countries inside and outside of Eurasone."
"We have the Schengen Zone, and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
"The first time it was said that countries that want to be united, whereas those who don't want to, can stay on their side."
“The number of such institutions will increase; it will be truly two-speed Europe” is awaiting Vizenov.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman van Romanpei in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all the States Parties, not just those in Euroson.
Story of brand:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses an IMB strategy, the closest are likely to be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid by her first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson-old.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His slogan, "Dumay!" thus became a stamp around which the life of the future giant (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to issue in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"To us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around herself.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more,” said the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care, just as Batya in the Czech Republic - IMB staff were one of the first American employees with paid leave, employers' insurance, elegant uniforms and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same advanced long-term relationships are IBM with consumers.
From the outset, the company found a brilliant use of talented people, which was one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Agreed with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, according to which a woman, Virginia Rometti, would change Palmisano next year.
She worked at the IBM for thirty years; she is now the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
In the last few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brain hurdles, in which many future innovations have emerged.
No wonder there are many ideas in the company that work about half a million people.
Organization with good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in the business is a strong domestic and external image.
“From the outset, from the point of view of IBM was rather an organization, not a technology company,” said Economist Professor Harvard Business Schools and author of the book IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps to solve business problems using technology," adds Joge Colony from the Forrester Research Consulting Company.
According to the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of his logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It appears to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
She owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, bankrupt, bank map, financial swap, bar code and floppy disk.
From $220 billion, according to market capitalization data, IBM this year became the second largest technological company (the first place, Apple company), cheating Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Watch Forward
Not all of her products came from buyers' taste and fit in the era, for example IBM was failing with its OS/2 operating system; prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by the movement forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms -- if they don't work, it refuses them.
It's different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, which is based on and undergoing falls on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
The main income of IBM is derived from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer programs and hardware.
While in 1990, it was twice as small as its capital, it was the strongest equipment producer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets worth $15 billion, and at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued its investment even after 2008, when the world first hit the current economic crisis.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
While IBM seems to have done no harm to the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by record 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have continued to rise.
IBM's corporate motto to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis arises, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original name, “Column Corporation, Tabulation, Records”, was quite complex.
It took the name IBM in 1924, which originally was the brand used for offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations for the future IBM were set up by the merger of four companies whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "tabel watch", i.e. hours, fixing the time when staff members come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlet Flint, a businessman who also headed a board of caregivers by 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competitor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then put the founder of IBM in the shadow - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an inevitable corporate culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as clearly from the name, began with the production and sale of various business equipment, from cheese knives and meat cuts to cash machines.
Over the first four years, Watson's leadership had doubled to $9 million, and the company's massive expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his seat in the director's chair took his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its guidance, IBM has begun to develop artificial intelligence technologies and has created the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights -- Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 -- to man's flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family, IBM line System/360.
A classic PC, which defined computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared in the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers by the Chinese company Lenovo, at the same time buying the PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting Office, thus fully concentrated on consulting and high value added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress in its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to use technology in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM has recently presented a platform for Smarter Commerce, which helps businesses to control the whole trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country at the same time in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters of central and eastern Europe is located in Prague, where a world-level research team is also working to recognize speech.
Richtargeva about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, leave it to yourself, I don't need it anymore!
Darina Richtarzeva (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartoshov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has defined clear rules for her future life.
"The Pepa can come home, but no longer like my partner," explained Richtarzov.
When Darina Richtarzeva gave Bartoshow’s bed in summer, she probably had no slightest idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Ivette to leave Rzichan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he confessed publicly that he loved her.
After a while, Darina surrendered, pretending to be in harmony with her husband's novelty; and now she finally apologized to him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartosov are ever tossed, his wife will not take him with his arms.
"He's the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to spend his last days in our home, no one's going to drive him out."
"But he'll end his days, not as my loved one, lost and found an old fool, but as a man with whom I'm connected," said Richtarzov, adding that she's already freed from her husband and insists only on mutual addictions.
Until Joseph has anything against what his wife rejected him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Eve, I'm not going to change this."
"My wife has decided to leave marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance is still in operation; I'm responsible for repairing, gardening, house and spinning."
"Darina and I are communicating perfectly well, only we don't share bed anymore," said Richtarge Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtargeva finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Yeveta, and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to call out some typical women's bad habits, they usually list them all right away.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the next lines describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Sping
Your second half complains you're always shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to make big sales shopping?
If so, your spinning can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for spinning.
Still, who of you will refuse to walk around the clothes shops in search of perfectly sitting clothes and illustrations (desirably in different colors) in the models?
Shepping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it might be hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Everlasting dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"Do I have to drop at least five kilograms-- maybe I'm going to start doing a gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracting me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you belong to a group of women whose appearance is confused.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have allergies to make constant complaints by a partner about their appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more complaints are raised, the more women are irritating them.
The Most Important Order and Cleanness
It's like an endless story.
Myka's glass, cleaning with dust, washing, dusting, bathing, at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming on a clean kafel in dirty boots; children for mud in a clean mud and fingerprints on a window glass in the living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this rejection, try to realize that being extremely extreme is not good; and that in your family order and cleanness should not be at the first place.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships as well as the family.
Determined to Command
"Put the laundry in the basket."
"You gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Small towels shouldn't lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your mate several times a day, he may find it very boring.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have had to command them so often...
Songs
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they love to discuss who, where, with whom, and why.
From time to time, maybe each of us has gossip.
We'll be frank, that's the nature of all women.
In any event, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, especially in the women's working group, who pose a great danger to their environment.
Effective transfers of Yagra and Vorchek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two effective transfers of the Hokkein attacking Jaromire Yagra helped Philadelphia win 5:3 on the Carolina ice and again became the most effective Czech player in the match.
In both cases, Claude Gira used the experience of the thirtieth-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best match player.
Two effective match transfers were also owned by a team with Yagrem Yakuba Vorachek.
After the Yagre match, he told foreign journalists that he had predicted to Gira a great night.
"I told him before the match he'd kill the Hit Trik."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jag, after whose actions Girus killed his head at the first opportunity that Flaires gave.
A little later, the second naked team also had a "chesh track".
The Harriquenz Vorocz was caught by a chaibo and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who killed between the circles.
One second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap with many advantages, but at the beginning of the second time, Flaires again took over.
Especially Gira.
After the Iagra was put to death the third naked; in the future, he was transformed into fourth naked by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely in the three of the best," said Jag, commending his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hokque player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now my turn came," added Jag.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rutu and the Dwyer toolbars, reducing the gap to one naked.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, which increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area."
"He hit the highway, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far edge."
"I was aiming at him and glad that it worked," described the Vorczek's impression from the last naked match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the East Conference.
The guard of the Monreal ceh Yaroslav Schpajk team did not complete a match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period because of the injury of the upper body.
With an experienced defender, Canada lost its two-fold advantage and lost 2:3 after the toolbar series.
Tomas Plechant was unable to kill during one of their attacks.
More than the lost points, the coacher was saddened by a large number of injuries in the back because the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the chabou out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added P.C. Subban Advocate
After 30 attacks, the Czech Halkper Onjah Palacez helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Golas Jets, who interrupted the five-year series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five government tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: žedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travels to the West were severely limited, tourist agencies at that time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists were on vacation to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Krym on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (either country on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; another individual journey was not possible.
At the time, tourism agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night, with the bedroom bag, or have good friends in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permits were needed to travel to the West and were not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
Czechoslovak currency was not freely converted; without monetary authorization it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for travel to the West.
Most of the Czechs had spent their vacations at home, resulting in a large number of cottages and summer homes, and this habit has been maintained to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic has thus experienced this revolution.
While before 1989 the GDR or Bulgarian leave was the culmination of our trips, the Czechs held 4,5 million vacations in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989, we could not freely visit Croatia, the most popular of all, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring Western European countries had been lifted, and this led to a huge wave of short journeys mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't be able to travel to the West, and everyone wanted to go there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at that time was not enough for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservatives, salts, etc.) to save money.
Another important thing is the introduction of a free-converted Czech crown, and decades later, our tourists are finally able to buy a western currency freely.
Our living standards and average income grew, which led to another important situation around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines, and as compared to the past, flights have become incredibly cheap as a result of the ability to order optical discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, there was no need for a visas to visit virtually all developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys easier.
The next significant event in the history of the post-revolution travel took place in 2000, with a great demand leading to a historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and the winter flights from the Czech Republic will be carried out in 12 exotic directions.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs are visiting exotic countries each year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visas for Czech tourists, and our country thus joined the most developed world countries forever.
For the first time in history, in 2008, more than half of their leaves were overseas (50.3 per cent); and for the first time in history, they spent over 15,000 kroner per person for leave abroad, including their costs at the destination.
The General Assembly must choose a president, the threat of the pat returns.
For about five months, there was no president of Czech football, and there is the risk that successor Ivan Gaschek, head of the Czech soccer association (FAR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the elections.
Without this, one of the three candidates will not begin a vote.
Jindrzych Rychl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are thirsty to lead Czech football.
Gasek left his post in June, leaving, he called on his colleagues to join together and find a strong identity that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Gaschek age has reloaded football in the scourge between the two chambers of an association that cannot choose a single candidate.
This was quite clear on 16 September when a new President had to be elected.
General Assembly delegates had not been able to arrive at the National House in Prague, Smikhs, since negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote in the general assembly, only lawful representatives or also officials to whom the authority had been given.
This period has since been partially settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights that a representation based on credentials is not possible.
Disputes on the rules of the elections, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help too much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was largely engaged in this issue.
Views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how can we move to the 3rd round and avoid a Pat?
“The argument is whether to follow the standards or find another model”, says one of the Vice-Presidents of FAHR Dushan Liberty, who represents a professional football at the Association Authority.
Based on the model provided for by the Charter, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to compromise - to be the winner of the election candidate with the highest number of voters in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists that, in a general percentage ratio, the winner must vote at least two thirds.
"Then, however, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agrees with the arguments of Moravia, and he says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
A few unexpectedly, Tomas Paclik agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that the rules of the elections set out by the statute set up the Pelta more than other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to pass as much by the statute."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representational foolishness as in the previous general assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is the candidate for the first time; and in his remarks he mostly contradicted Pelte.
The pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that the candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
“Every emotional drowsing will be calmed after today's expected release of a national assembly at the European Championship”.
“Futball will be happy again, people will be more willing to cooperate,” said the representative of Yablonica, and of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both the professional and the regional levels.
Reichl's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
"It's not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to deliberately adapt the rules."
"It can cause another break in the general assembly."
"I hope good meaning wins," said Reichle.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual negotiations have been held directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be delivered, among others, to the Vice-Presidents of Daliber Coucher and Raikla to Podgorica, did not come out of Prague in the morning because of technical failure, and sought an alternative to bring a part of the executive committee to the place of the winning match.
Finally, a ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be crucial.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like the opponents of the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; soccer credit capacity; and the planned general meeting of CNSTV with the new Czech sport directive following the financial problems of Sazki.
Patzlik is in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the soccerists, Plzen Tomas Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for President Futball Association of the Czech Republic (FAHRC), he would not have claimed a high position.
"If I had been a decent candidate, I'd fight for him and I wouldn't take part in the fight."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Patzlik ‰TK.
The Motivation of Patzlik to fight Miroslav Pelta and Jindrzhich Rayhl to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favourite of the elections, from entering the administration of FARR.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that in the event of victory, he will remain President only until 2013, when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to take up an experienced top manager who is not too tied to football.
"I talked to a few people that could be meant."
"To me it was terrible to hear some of them say they don't even want to be connected to Czech football at this time."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, Patzlik’s main disagreement with Pelta is related to the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbra, President of the Plsen regional football association. Berb is a person of controversial reputation, known behind the videos as an influential lobby, capable of influencing the voices of delegates of the General Assembly.
Patzlik thus finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and soccer will not move forward."
"With the support of Berbra, a capable businessman, it would be even more harmful to football," said Patzlik.
He suggests that a few years ago, the name of Pelta was written during the telephone audit of the corruption case; Pelte was avoided.
"I don't know the prestige of Pelta's victory would bring football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlik, and he no longer mentions his previous statement that he would "sold the Pelta club if he became President."
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik supported before the general congregation in September, the end of the fiasco.
"He would have been the first to whom I would call."
'He's very capable.'
"I can introduce it to the head of the assembly."
"But he can't control the association."
"I don't, too, have a nose in what I don't know," said Patzlik, who drew a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of a judge's brigade led by Louis Maceloy, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patzlik claims he's going to risk controlling the association.
He refers to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he has run the Plzen team, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the power to make the soccer environment change, to support her changes to the best."
“To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence disciplinary and appeals councils, which leads to disgusting situations,” said Patzlik, and he did not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinsky.
One of its priorities will be the strengthening of the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee and, with the assistance of the Czech Olympic Committee, it will lobby more money from lottery fees at the highest political level.
"It's one of the key points that the new President has to deal with."
"If taxes are taxed for gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must make clear where the money will go," he said.
Patzlik does not consider his relationship with the Plzen Club to be a burden, although he claims that the President of FAHRC should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the apple, and Reichl's with the Prague Douche.
"It's not a perfect option."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my pulse club to someone else, as long as I'm going to go back there in six months," says Patzlik.
The Pelta promised new FAHR rules that would avoid the Electoral Pata
Two days before the general soccer association, one of the candidates to the President, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was chosen, he would fight for the new FARR rules to avoid disputes over the rules of election in the future.
Prior to the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, the Yablonica function remains optimist and believes that the attention paid to the electoral struggle will have an appreciable impact on today's expected success of our soccer assembly.
Prior to the September elections, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and financial resources.
He decided to take part in the elections at the last moment in front of the last general assembly, and a two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the President to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that now is the time for someone to lead the association,” claims the person, mainly associated with the Yablones club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
That gives him reason to assume that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed during Ivan Gashek’s reign.
"Alas, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different modes of representation were not taken, we would have had a President since September," said Pelta.
He referred to the census of a key civil association document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as my personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we can't exist," claims Pelta.
In addition, he says he's not trying to exhibit himself in the background of rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrzhich Reich, whom he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his sponsor candidate had to become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he had not attacked Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for more than a year and has made some success."
“Anyway, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his pre-election campaign.”
"Everything is why some of them now question his true identity," said Pelta about their competitors, and Pelta himself claims to be faithful to the declarations that he declared in September.
It considers its main weapon to know football, from competition at the lowest level to national assembly.
The national assembly must represent the whole football.
“I would also try to end all incidents, beginning with the case of the Bohemians or the consequences of the corruption scandal last year.”
“I would immediately focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football,” said the 40-year-old candidate two months ago.
He then promised that his election to a soccer head would not lead to the dismissal of the staff.
"I'll need to know the official instructions of individual staff." It was his message to the Insurance where the protracted period of interstate was a clear nerve.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general congregation, he believed that delegates would come to Nimburg on Thursday in vain.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold the elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
"Futboll needs the trust that he can gain, only by finally selecting his leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career, is still optimistic.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, FAHR will work actively.
If the meeting on Thursday Jindrzych Reich, the vice president, becomes president of the Czech soccer association, many people in the Association will be disapproved.
Rachel promises that if he's chosen, the time of hard work will come.
He wished to establish changes in the system and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for selected areas in soccer.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national assembly, professional soccer and soccer activities for youth”.
"Then I don't mean to say I'm gonna do it myself," said Rychl in his interview for TeK.
"I'm a commander, and I want to distribute the powers to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a particular area."
"I'm going to give the task carefully so that, in each of these segments, so football will take a big step forward."
"It's probably not going to like many people because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the soccer movement allegedly caused him to question his candidacy.
"Oh, I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know whether there is any point in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put my sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Although, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't abandon," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gaschek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to override all of this."
"There were processes that could produce results in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be selected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Hashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent."
"He's surrounded by people who would be soccer so that he can only be available to the chosen ones."
"It's a lot of accusation to me, but it's definitely not subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make soccer accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority," said Reichle.
Moreover, he denounces the charges that he will only be the President of Czechia.
"While many people are trying to claim the opposite, I'm planning to do the best for Moravia."
“The time has come to think about the division of the second League into the Czech and Moravian side, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league.”
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Reich.
While Plsenzie Tomas Paclic was in the presidential struggle, Reichl is not daring to assess his chances of winning.
“I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice president, and I see that I have made some obvious achievements,” said Rajl, and to his success, he attributed the savings of tens of millions of kroner to unfavourable contracts, television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he blamed himself in part that there was no unity in the association.
Affirming that Pelta was “excluded from the process of returning Czech football to credit,” he considers another rival, Patzlik, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plsen this year."
"If they choose him, I hope he will continue what Ivan Haszek began without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't distort the facts for his benefit," said Ryclus about his rival.

Children's basins with universal fiber optics and status basins in Budapest can test the incredible water of Europe - and relax the stagnant body in jakuza after a tour of town or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder had been able to do during her research trips for the past 1,5 years: without his purchasing suit.
On her back in the water, she looked up at the taste of the domes, sailed to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the basin and admired carefully rebuilt swimming basins in Ar-Nuo-style.
She hastened to add each pleasing basin to her notebook with important details about building and the history of the building.
The historian of the Meder Architecture examined more than 200 swimming basins - and now gathered impressions in its recently published book Ba dedereuden (Boot Radio), where everything came from the public basins in Munich to the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and the “functional concrete buildings” in Towns.
Its “travel into the most unusual baths in Central Europe” was carried out through 13 countries, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and visited the bathals in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real enthusiast of the bulk culture.
She's very little enthusiasm for sport, says Meder, but in the water it's different.
The only flaw is that swimming worshipers must tolerate the blue kafelal tile and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the attractive smell of mine forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"Once I asked myself why the swimming basins should always be so horrible," says a living in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The basin swimming and the sauna oils are a healthful factor in the bathroom, because Meder believes that all feelings are stimulating.
And swimming basins can be a real pleasure to your eyes if the builders take on such work. "In the case of sex in the pool you have the surface of the water."
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All visually reflected: high ceilings, color tiles and temples.
The illustrated publication Bathing Radio on 190 pages provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasis - and makes you want to jump into the water.
The Meder collector found several outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
It found abundant nitrate water in the carstoon cave (The Pearl Bath in Mischalt-Tapolz) and the thermal bath filled with latch water in a bottle - built building (Városi Termalfürdö in Yasbrén) and excellent therapeutic bathings, such as 100-year-old Secén in Budapest.
You can see all of the Zurich from the bath on the roof, or you can see the snowed Arlberg from the open basin in St. Anton, and there's a window in the vapour that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Maybe the most unusual design is expected by the bathers in Langenfeld, and the Aqua-consort in Etztal looks like the NFO, just landing in the Alps.
In winter, couples of three open seashells rise from it, seemingly small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
The Meder basin collector did not meet the smell of chlorine in each basin.
A lot of thermal baths smell like sulfur, and the Arpad baths in Bekeschab smell so much of oil that you can't believe you're in a healthy source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbonates in liquid water, and the water is almost black from the ila that is sticking to the skin as soon as you get into the pool, the healthful experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing sites, and when she tried to visit the Czech baths pool in the Lugačovicas, she found that the territory was sealed.
The baths designed by the architect Dushan Jurković in 1902 were closed.
When the Meder looked into the red-white-glass window, she saw the weeds growing between the kafelal tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot footprints is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald, the Palais des thermal waters in Bad Wildbad.
You will find not only neo-romanic elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra Hall, which was added in about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Termal Palace, a favorite swimming pool of Iris Meder basin, was not just because it was from Schwarzwald.
"This present achievement is so skillful to combine such different architectural styles," said Meder.
Digging into a thermal basin in such a palace is obviously a secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Tives
Will the Doiche Bank stop trade in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Accermann assigned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director is planning to make changes in January.
Hamburg--
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of the Germans find it unacceptable that banks are speculating on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study carried out by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the organization of Foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Shuman, demonstrates that playing on world commodity exchange rates raises prices - and thus banks are involved in world hunger.
The campaign of consumer defenders is directed directly against the Head of the Bank of Doiche, Josef Accermann, although large banking houses, such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, do the same.
Initially, the rates for goods were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that players have renounced the rules of supply and demand and are profitable from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Accermann responded to criticism and promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade “does not risk the good reputation of Doich Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank is then planning to announce the changes followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or end completely.
Accermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news by stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector.
As the bank's chief lobbist, Accermann has a certain responsibility, in Bode's opinion.
"The Bank must remove from the portfolio all the investments that make the money rates for food prices," said Bode.
“It doesn't matter whether it's about hungry people or the reputation of Douche Bank.”
Accermann's quick reaction first starts to surprise, but the Director would like to have an indiscriminate image only a few months before he ends his office.
The Bank announced on Monday that the President would not move to the Monitoring Board as planned.
The revocation of speculation on the food market could improve its image.
And he shouldn't care much about the costs, and the consequences would be his successor's.
Each other would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, a study was carried out for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 participated.
No more than eleven per cent believe that investments that make the food price rate are acceptable to the Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank had been involved in such a trade, and each other would have revoked contributions that ultimately led to the speculation of goods.
43 per cent recommended leaving the bank, 49 per cent said they would think of closing the account and going to another bank.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
Pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Winsowsky
Architecture history with raids, falls and happy endings, and the Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels has won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's reopened as a exhibition center.
The pavilion of Austria, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels, is a well-known example of a modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass lounges, bold to believe in technological progress.
Pavilion Schwanzera conquered Gran Pré on architecture in 1958 for his light vapour structure of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World exhibition.
Eventually, he was glorified throughout the world in 1973 by his legendary four-cylinder tower BMW and her sister, a cup-shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss garden near the south station of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th century Museum in 1962 - and often referred to as the 20th century House for that reason.
In any event, the building was not suitable for the Museum for technical and spatial reasons - there were no walls on which art works could be hanged, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been emptied since 2001, and its condition has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Kryshanitz has now reinstated the pavilion, called the 21st Century House, and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Belvetter Museum, which will open the first exhibit on Tuesday night, in all senses a happy event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvetter Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husslein Arco, a graduate of the Art History Faculty with a brilliant career figure in youth, who worked in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and guardians to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to contain a permanent exhibition of Fricus Votroba, a cafe, and a bookstore along with modern arts, and a office building was to be built.
Strong control & limited budget
Kryshanitz was the ideal candidate for the project then.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession, Josef Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied at Schwanzer University of Technology, and the pavilion was a “excellent place” for him, where he attended exhibitions “between every week”.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks facing the building, a building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose in the last adjustment were much more serious, and the building was a “energy absorber”, says Kryshanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, an enhanced glass filament was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-protected safety glass.
Steel translators of the warm bridge were reinforced or replaced and asbestos were removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, and the burning well between the building and the streets lighted a virtually new building, but still elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated into an old red-rooted colour of protection against corrosion.
Hall of movie theater is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict control of museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by museum administration," says Kryshanitz, pointing to an unequal moisture in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite constraints, problems and transformation.
Kryshanitz recently noticed that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough, a typical story of "copples in town."
Such an architecture "not in its own place" and yet wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The home of the 21st century is in a very proper place, since the planning of the city has caused unexpected luck, and the complete reconstructed “primary station” with offices and property is growing around the Swiss garden.
The 21st century house may be supplemented by the second Kryshanitz building, the French collector von Gabsburg has acquired the Interim Berlin Exhibition Hall and is reported to have negotiated with the city about its neighbourhood in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million-driven anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn promulgated an anti-crisis plan to avoid the abolition of winter trains.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Expenses will amount to millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter revocation and late trains.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn ' s internal anti-crisis plan, the Bild reports that by 2015 investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned.
Investments are intended to improve the capacity of locomotives and the railway network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff members involved in snow cleaning from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Groubé, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains in the winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
During the winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains were awaiting the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in feeding ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check for many years the ICE train axis much more often after one of the ICE trains broke an axis at the Kelne main station.
The Bank will pay a lot of millions of pounds of fines in the United States.
New troubles followed the turmoil of Josef Accermann, Director - General of Doyce Bank: Doyce Bank is threatening a U.S. fine in millions of pounds.
It was as if the Bank had little problems in the country, the past industrial giant in the United States had now driven him. Doiche Bank, with headquarters in Frankfurt, would pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle the disputes that had arisen since bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was about selling mortgage bonds.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks that they used false promises to deceive credit unions to buy their financial products.
The cost of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are glad to have solved this problem without the parties to the court”, said the representative of Doiche Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not accept its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the rapid reaction of both banks.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and interferes with bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is struggling to compensate for losses that are released from billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer initiated a case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The doubtful mortgage bonds are the so-called securities provided by the mortgage pool.
They are supported by domestic loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when the bubble was thrown in the United States real estate market in 2007.
The American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered a long life in September 2008 on the dam of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims requiring compensation or punishment for fraudulents.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is the largest claim wave.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having acquired bail agreements from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for about $200 billion.
The Bank is also in danger of prosecuting FHFA for numerous agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the bank with the headquarters in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for “existent losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
The Bank rejected claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in IBM.
Since March, he has purchased more than ten billion dollars in stocks.
To date, the largest United States investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he has not invested in computer and IT, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report IBM changed his view of investments to this industry.
According to Buffett, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, the investments of Warren Buffett have been regarded as a romantic act.
IBM, IT industry veteran, now got the name "Sir IBM."
In an interview with the American Business Canal, CNBC Buffet reported that he had acquired an IBM share of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment Holding Berkshire Hathaway was one of the largest shareholders of IBM with 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn't known anything about his participation until recently.
He commended the management that had been able to make profits even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a great job," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
The considerable time of IBM was focused on high-income IT services, such as the date-centres.
The computer industry, now over 100 years old, has also offered software and advisory services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffett has still avoided technological companies.
He claimed to invest only in those companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail, in the production of lubricants and in engineering.
His Berkshire Hathaway has shares in the long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Münchener Rück), together with some 80 of his own daughters.
The 81-year-old Berkshire Hathaway acquired a small textile company in the 1960s and made it one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest,
making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct in the making of money brought him the name "Oracula from Omahi."
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before the opening of the markets after the Buffet investment was announced.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, stands on a stock exchange of over 220 billion dollars, which makes it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Unlimited danger
Following the detection of a “juicy in Twickau”, Turkish media questioned the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of blood ideology, which now rises again to the surface.
The killing of eight Turkish and one Greek businessmen between 2000 and 2006 was a result of the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been the reaction to this communication in Turkey and the German-Turkey community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has resulted in long-standing fears, such as the right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the Mellene firings in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing network that has now been discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The birth of blood ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Haberturk newspaper.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in the law-enforcement moor.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, noting the victims of racial hatred with a silent peak in front of the Brandenburg gate on these weekends.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Community of Berlin held a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented positively, as a history of success.
Some Turkish media education was like a plaque. "Germany's fiftieth anniversary gift" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X" commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet did not miss the occasion for this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He noted that people who had paid taxes and their work had been killed had made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the following successful raids were severely criticized by German-Turkey Internet forces.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before of monitoring suspicious persons in the law-enforcement circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. “If they continue to act in the same manner, migrants will have no other choice than armed self-defence.”
"It'll be the best self-defence."
"Peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the whole network will be hidden and on the rightfulness of punishment," says Selen.
Crimes in Melle and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to the world in Germany.
The picture of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply impressed by the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turks that they live there that they are at risk and to the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do Not Repeat the Wrongness of the Past
During that period, the Turkish press condemned mainly the failures of the German police following the attacks.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the firings in Zolingen, but the participation in the memorial ceremony in Kelne took his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel in his speech to calculate the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
Like he defined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks to the current German State has deepened since then.
It was clear that it was now necessary to do more than to identify and re-evaluate law-enforcement terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on the Zurich Lake
Most of the leading risked bank policies of Europe are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS has barely been mistreated during the financial crisis and since then has been struggling with one or the other crisis.
Now the German has to get him back to the right course.
Alex Weber certainly didn't know he'd get that part.
In July, after his effective departure from the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin to serve as an equally effective chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss Bank of UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously fascinated, commended Switzerland for her beauty, the UBS for its renewed strength and made several friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to make a difference."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Philiger and Oswald Gрюbel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be different.
The UBS trader in London has passed the bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Grubely, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the UBS board president has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally come to his office?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And as the bank stated on Tuesday, he would be chaired by the Board in May and not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of the economy and specialist, not a traditional banker, and he will no doubt need time for adaptation.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he's long deserved to be called "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, it has managed the largest assets in the world -- and on the other, it hasn't come out of the scandals for years.
I think the proud Swiss bank doesn't spare anything.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a good reputation.
The Bank has linked the image of a hidden and sustainable, at the same time screwing asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, UBS managed 1.6 billion in 2007, thus managing more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank entered the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and a banking professor who has long been a teacher at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains, "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you can ask how I could make this mistake."
He was really mistaken.
It was only in 2007 that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffley's executive director, who was considered to be an outstanding intellectual and to the same extent a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to assume why he left.
The Bank ' s investment unit tried to play substandard securities and had to write off billions.
You would like to believe you don't, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in order to cope with the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors -- but investors whose services many bankers have recently renounced politely -- one very untransparent Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund that has been hidden so far that even its name has not been reported.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marsel Ospel, the second salary level of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a catastrophe arose, and due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was threatened with a collapse and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic securities for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for converted bonds with mandatory converts to become bank owners.
Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of huge banks reservoiring in the small country.
Finally, the UBS final balance in 2007 was five times higher than all Switzerland ' s production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says a bank analyst Geiger.
The second catastrophe came shortly after the first.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that he was ready to transmit data to wealthy clients who might have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, resulting from compensation for unjustified business revenues plus fines.
The UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, the UBS lost what was always his advantage in the fight for rich customers, the veil of secrecy.
Thereafter, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as it was before.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
There's a customer's money coming out.
Over a few months, the bank has lost its confidence in both main areas of its activities - investments due to failure in speculation and asset management as a result of aid and the promotion of tax evasion.
And it just calmed down and it seemed that the UBS was able to break the situation as this disaster happened with an affiliate-trider, and the single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
"Adoboli's incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Jansen, professor of economy and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also doubts: “UBS is not having a risk control tool”.
It was the precaution that for a long time the Swiss bankers had been keeping the world's largest assets, not an unnecessary risk, but the security of money, whether or not the world had collapsed outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss bank seifs have become a symbol of irresistible reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize a delicate taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her position is classical in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich in Banhofstrass, which leads from the main station right to the Zurich Lake, surrounded by snow caps of Swiss mountains.
Buildings here are luxurious, and rent rates are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli, there are jewellery companies like Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks were located here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Cradi Suiss and elite private banks, such as Julius Bar.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
There are large leather couches along the walls covered by the marble, alongside the emblem bank with a large Seif index.
UBS knows what his clients need, is reliability.
But both of the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss notions of banking - or, according to the head of one of the small Swiss banks, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper, like all the Swiss bankers, he's also collaborating with the two largest banks.
He believes that the UBS has become too big -- in particular in an investment banking, where anthrosaxes are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add here.
"And if there is something, then they've adapted for a long time to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, brought him the first big profits, and then the fiasco, and no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008.
“In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people carried out the largest lifesaving operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hesig in his book The UBS Crashe.
Politicians approved the provision of SwF 68 billion (about Euro45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it be?
If they ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank has been established, which was too large for a small Switzerland at the time of merger, and a bank that has continued to grow.
It was also helpful that two UBS banks were complemented, one was a rich but advanced bank specialized in Zurich for asset management; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to the large amount of money they could use to rotate the all-power wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group, from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Walfley, the outstanding intellectual, modest and profoundly understanding models and statistics, and the Spell with its internal instinct that went all the way upstairs, starting with the intern in the bank."
But the Ashel eventually laid on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake, "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride is preceded by defeat.
UBS people remember well the meetings of government members, at which Wolfley always repeats the same slogan to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the tournament table, where bank successes were made.
UBS wanted to be at the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency trade and public securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak place, according to the parameter referred to in the bank terminology as “permanent income”, the UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgage products.
To close the hole, the UBS got involved in an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In an effort to increase, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in United States sub-standard securities.
This developed into a large mechanism that combined the securities based on American mortgage loans and sold them further, continuing to carry the risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way to get out of this process, the UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought up to the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," says a bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to go as the bank tried to get ordered was more difficult than it seemed.
The UBS posts have become a child’s chair game and remain unreliable until now.
Anyone who leads this huge bank faces almost no challenge.
He has to find a strategy for the bank that has turned his back to all the existing business models.
The Geiger banking analyst already has an idea of relinquishing investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be pushed substantially.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was in fact considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Over the past, he has been able to demonstrate his character and is now, as the Zurich Bank stated on Tuesday, heading the UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernottie plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But that will not be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are certainly asked by Axel Weber.
He said publicly to this day that he and his wife were looking for their apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The risk of recession in Europe is dwindling the American Stock Exchange
The current recession in Europe had worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome has not had much effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has hampered the hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryo.
The overall relief that followed the change of Governments in Rome and Athens has not been backed up.
Euro fell towards the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still thought to be half full, not half empty -- but now the problems go back, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges were, inter alia, on sales lists.
The industrial index of Dow Jones was closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer varied between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1251 point, falling per cent.
The Nasdaq Technological Index lost 0.8 per cent, traded at 2657 locations.
Frankfurt Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 euro zones has significantly reduced production and adjusted by the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that companies had produced two per cent less in September than in the previous month.
This report squeezed American investors into skepticism, "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to be fast at recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett had only been able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do what was needed to end the crisis.
In his view, therefore, it was too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett had dropped a ten-year-long principle into the trash basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investments in IBM amounting to over ten billion dollars raised the price of this oldest company's shares by almost one percent against the trend.
The stocks were closed at $187.35 at almost the same time.
Buffet stated that he paid an average of $170 per share and now had a 5.5 per cent share.
The price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 per cent.
The stocks of the Bank of America have fallen by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining share of the Chinese Structural Bank, with $6.6 billion.
The Bank is mainly planning to support its capital quota with net profits from sales in order to meet more stringent standards.

The shares of 719 companies increased, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
The shares of 630 companies have completed the sales, 1913 falling and 82 remaining at the same level at Nasdaq with 1.38 billion shares.
Crowds fill cities
The players are considered to be troubled birds in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be expelled from cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and the crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but people who complain about mud and noise are growing in many settlements.
The solution to the bird problem, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first crow symposium, in Ler in East Freezia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to drive a raid out of towns.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Finding Urban Alternatives
Conservationists argued that the root of the urban problem was in a particularly protected gigantic migration, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and deforestation of traditional trees made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
In Zest in Westphalia and north-west Yever, Dipholz, Achima under Bremen and Lera, there are large colonies with over 600 parental couples.
A mixed project to shoot the crows in Lera brought up grim newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the fishing of birds in traps and their beating with sticks as special cruelty.
"Susual movement and spilling are nothing" said the architect and the landscape designer Werner Clever of Leur.
Manfred Caiser, environmental expert from Lara, Baden-Württemberg, said that the breaking down of nests of water or wood was often undesirable.
"Living people are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas."
Intimidation is only possible in the form of exceptions near hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We're gonna have to live with them.
In the distance from the surrounding areas, the problem in cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of birds ' abstinence from those in need of protection in the residential areas and their inducing them to return to other areas could be a exit.
"Information stands instead of benzopil," was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Utah Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to cope with this problem."
Jürgents was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Golstein, where information on the life of a very deliberate game is provided on the information stands.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgents also expressed her opinion about the noise complaints made by birds, "The noise is a great deal of information, and they have to tell each other a lot of things."
The galaxy of these birds has come into legends, and the players are often not only using the weapon to get the groomed pieces, but also making the weapons themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested a bird’s mind at four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to knock on the rainbow to get a larvae of moth.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to break down the rainbow.
In another experiment, the artificial players had to meet a more complex challenge.
The researchers placed a small veil with a moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get a ring.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds took a wire to make terns and used terns to tie the ceiling behind the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done this since the first attempt.

The Turks were almost perfectly able to start 31,000 audiences at the Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's far-reaching blow was in the seventh minute, and the attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to turn the ball into the net.

Constantine Vasilev of the guest team compared the account for the 57th minute.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China

Mass killings - human dimension
The tense and very good new book Peter Englund "Beautiful and Terror: Personal History of World War I" begins with a long list of active persons whose heart is dying.
Here's the advice to read next: be careful to clear this page and use it as a bookmark.
You'll be very close to these people as you tell Mr. Englund, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your lighthouse at the moment that, as if one of these men and women were, you'll get off the road and lose yourself in the fog of war.
Mr. Angelund, Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize on Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it quite precisely as "working on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, feasible journalists, or tactics and military equipment.
It's not as much a book as it was, he explains, "How much book about what it looked like," it's about "sensibilities, impressions, experiences and the state of the spirit."
The book “Beautiful and Trouble” has consolidated the experience of 20 more than or less intriguing men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolchildren and caregivers to Alpinists, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone's gonna fall captive, lose his hand or his leg, get mad or die.
Their lives are frozen here as church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some are extinguished at that time.
The book of Mr. Englund is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the submission that the First World War was only a grave trench war in the West Front.
"Beautiful and grudge" is a mastery of other theatres of hostilities: Alp, Balkan, East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The warriors in this book fall on the bee hulves; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is the chain flies.
It's a fascinating book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina, smelling of smokeless powder.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your children, will you stay in place or you'll run away?
Anyway, who's going on?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight in this war.
"Dissue of fact," observes Mr. Englound, "followed by speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, imposing ideas, conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Beautiful and sad" tracks the destiny of such people as Florence Farmbo, English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German high sea fleet sailor.
Their stories are largely taken from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories about their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive because of Mr. Anglound's small moments and intrinsic details.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Speaking the story of a German school girl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere erzaz."
"Replacement, fake aluminium, non-real rubber, paper trunks, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about erzaz food in Germany.
It describes “the meat of the pressed rice erected in the ram of fat (and decorated with false bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes; the shoes undertook by the tree.”
It notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat authorized in the production of cobbasas, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories tell us about honor and courage.
One American observes the very tendency to be cruel and says of the war, "You feel that, after all, this is what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or noseller, and to claim that this show is a civilization and under your handsome shirt with your tips does not hide barbar."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or be disappointed.
"When a person is humiliated with the idea of self-sacrificing, he would like to think that this will happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's scary to look like a "custodial man who is hanged in secret."
Other comments concern the old Europe that is decaying and new forms of fear.
"Conflict was becoming more economic competitors," writes Mr. Englound, "war factories."
He notices the coming of someone who is called "a new species in the untiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass killer in a well-silent suit that carries a massacre sitting at a written table."
People act in an unforeseen way: low-deeds are as much as heroism.
Mr. Angelund described the soldiers who had tried to harass prostitutes with a venereal disease in order to avoid service on the front.
“The grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in the Gonorey gnome, which soldiers bought and unmarried by their genitals in the hope of going to hospital,” he writes.
"The despairers have wiped him in their eyes, which has often led to life's blindness."
Mr. Englund, translated with Swedish Peter Graves prose, is flexible but negotiable, well suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how war “frees completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are beginning to ask why their leaders force them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassell or such novels as "In the West Front without Change" by Ericha-Maria Remarca, not by exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this insane pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in a bad literature.
I won't tell him.
But it's like he's pulled into the page with the list of characters, grabbed it from your hands, and burned it with a beverage.
After a previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
Night hours from Monday to Tuesday were selected because the Zukotti Park was supposed to be the least people.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said they were leaving for the teachings.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence stressed the importance of the Department of Police operations.
There could be no repetition of recent weeks of episodes such as the use of list gas against protesters, which contradicted the department ' s rules and caused a horror of public sympathy to the occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to free the protesters from the Zukotti Park.
The authorities were preparing to observe occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis teachings were held on the island of Randels in Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot trainings in the case of counter-terrorism measures, involving the rapid movement of a large number of police officers, in view of Lower Manhattan.
The last training was held on Monday night on East River Manhattan side.
The order came into the park at the last minute, and the source was familiar with the orders in which the task was mentioned only as "training."
"These few cops I know and who were summoned to do this have not been told that they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke on anonymity.
"The only who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated to hundreds of protesters who had been in the midst of the scheduled period, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, various police officers, including police teams from districts, were involved in the operations, which were usually used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as workplaced, came and left the park during the day, making it an hour of the night a suitable time for coming.
"That was the right thing to do when the park is the least of the people,," he said.
Rescue vehicles with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
A search engineer and pre-recorded announcements from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue branches, many protesters just collected their things and left.
The police reported that the tents had not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to collect the things.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, met perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their safety.
Many journalists, however, claim that they were not allowed to see the police act and that police officers treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Chech Street, along the western border of the park, could take off the picture.
When the police went westward through the chest of personal objects of protesters, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what had been thrown out.
Some protesters who refused to leave, pulled out, photographs of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions next to the kitchen camp, at the park centre.
Some built barricades, and the police came inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp episcentre were clutching themselves together for hands.
And two people were clinging to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue officers were summoned to cut the locks.
No arrests were taken in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, reported to the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 persons had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for “a violation of public order and resistance in detention”, he said.
The highest officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the D.D.'s search police, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “not led the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second police team was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if it was necessary to enter.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and in Pine Street, a quarter south.
The observers saw the police expand the perimeter even farther away from the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people even further.
About 28 people were in the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning south of Pyne Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, fired air from police van tyres.
At some point in the crowd, a piece of fondre.
As a result, a police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Trade Union of School Serving Personnel will bring the city to court for dismissal
Trade union, representing hundreds of school staff members who lost their place last month, plans to bring the city to court on Wednesday, stating that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory due to disproportionate influence on the schools where poor students are enrolled.
Judicial proceedings are probably the latest means available to the 37 District Council Union to try to cancel dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, the co-ordinator for working with parents and other employees who were among the most low-paid workers in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the fact that the leaders of the trade union called the political response to their refusal to provide the city with access to health funds managed by the groups of workers to close the hole in the budget last spring.
Urban officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the Urban Council hearings last month, the Chancellor of Schools, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were part of the budget they had signed in June.
One of the members of the Board coupled, saying that nowhere in the budget had been indicated that school support staff would be dismissed.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had notified the claims by warning the Department of Education that a claim was filed against them; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to file a formal complaint before the Supreme Court of the State in Manhattan.
As respondents, Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be identified as respondents, and eight temporary workers will be dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as the majority of those who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the City Legal Department, said that the city had not seen a claim and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint before New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and the Upper East Syd schools or Tribeki had few, 17 school supporters had lost their place in Browsville, Brooklyn, district 23, and 46 had to leave Counties 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
While noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of students live in poverty, the complaint states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill the gaps in the budget”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way in which to calculate additional funding for every poor student who enters school.
Trade Union also claims that school directors could be misleaded by a notification that allows dismissal of focal points for work with parents.
The notice used the word “excess”, although “excess” was more often referred to when the teacher from the school payroll was moved to the list of available employees paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six focal points for work with parents were dismissed," says the draft claim, "and not just transferred."
Mission complete, Congress ready for the Libyan Agreement
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol Hill are finally ready to accept something relevant to the rebellion in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion succeeded, the long-standing dictator Muamar Kaddafi was taken captive and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Senate should consider a resolution put forward by John Kerry (Democrates, Massachusetts) with the Senators, John McKain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (Independent, Connectikut), which commends the Libyans for the successful rebellion and United States troops for their “responsibility”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” said Kerry.
“This is a confirmation of their support for the democratic aspirations of both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussions on Libya were easily held.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions which endorsed or condemned the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing the limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties ' votes and has not yet been voted to the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also failed to support a proposal that would cut down the financing of an American operation in Libya.
This left an American mission with a kind of legislative purgatory - when Congress is frustrated enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry to actually break the ground out of her foot.
Then the events hindered the indecision of the Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and, on 20 October, Kaddafi was killed.
NATO Mission officially concluded on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “respects the people of Libya for their incredible braveness and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation for the protection of the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Council for Foreign Affairs or dissolved by legislators as the June Bill?
Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee, spoke against the latest version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives this week must vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some of the democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives by Bob Goodlat (republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary of the Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to submit their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
Gudlat's amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that affect a wide range of issues that have been made in that constituency.
Some duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were minor variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendments only in the House of Representatives and more on “Control over federal expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mostly to the newly elected Republicans, who want to decorate their summaries, the opportunity to boast that they have made such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required that both the House of Representatives and the Senate vote for the amendment of the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of an unconditional resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congresses wish to limit the term of office of the members of the Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrates, New York) wishes to cancel the limitation of two times for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Junior (Democrates, Illinois) proposed numerous amendments guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting single-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, as is another, prohibiting flag burning.
Some legislators also wish to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the States object to them.
As members of the Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are no quicker than in previous years.
In the 111th congress, legislators proposed 77 of these amendments and 66 of the 110th.
This rate will be measured as compared to the beginning of the 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did nothing more than now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually submitted to Congress in 1789.
"Broken but not defeated," says Gifffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after the armed man shot her in a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives, Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona), appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, screwed the music from the Broadway show “The Sun Will Return tomorrow” and said that he wanted to get better back to Congress.
Having emerged from the 20/20 programme of EBC News with Diana Soyer, Giffords had been difficult to formulate proposals and needed help in walking.
The programme showed her a difficult way to rehabilitate after a bullet wound that skulled and smashed the left side of the brain from the front to the rear of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on ceiling.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which 13 people were killed and injured, Gifffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "critical."
Soyer, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
Interview with Gifffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the “20/20-hour special issue”, which was shown on the eve of the new “Gabby: History of Courage and Hope”.
The special release reported on the rehabilitation of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In the first few weeks Kelly's video, she's on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Gifffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to do simple things.
Kick your head.
Get your lips out.
And then her first word, "what."
A few days later, Gifffords said the second word, "tost," a request to change the lunch menu.
The video EBC shows that music played a central role in healing Gifffords: we see the congressman singing with the "Girls just want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free fall" to Tom Petty.
In an interview by Soyer Gifffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, said she didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told me that he had read a Giffford article in the March 12 paper on shooting, when she stopped him to ask the first time about the six who were killed.
The suspected attacker Jard Li Lafner is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people have died," said Gifffords Sawyer.
"It's hard, hard, hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Soyer said, "I'm over."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not winning," said Kelly.
You're just beaten.
And you're going through it, you're gonna get better and come back stronger than ever.
The warrior feels more sorry than respect.
The event was a celebration at Wall Street, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, seafarers, pilots, and marine infantry were signaled to erect around him.
The auditorium in tuxedo applauded him standing.
"The soldiers looked like heroes," said David Salzman, who organized a spring collection of money.
The Senior Military Officer at a concert, who was also the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
Quite opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Vojskas are lauded for their sacrifices.
But the praises have their price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if it feels sorry for people in form.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon drove to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to show some support is to treat us as miserable."
This is a sensitive theme for military leaders who do not want to look ungrateful or dissenting with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam was much worse.
As a result, most pity talks are quietly and only between the war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from the hostilities of the marine infantry, the colonel in his resignation, Mark Kenshn, warned them that the people who were not members of the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, for they rumbled the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others would think that there was a “strong evil veteran under the mask,” said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, returning back, took a high government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he relates, he feels that some interviewers were careful to ask if he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington immediately after the fighting.
Cann remembers how he said to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative effects."
The frustration experienced by the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely commended by a country that is little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefits from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as it was usually in World War II,” says the Lieutenant General in the resignation of David Bernow, who commanded United States troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
Vojska is evaluated by the number of trains they have done, by number of comrades they lost or by scale of loss.
Army faces the growing pressure of supporters to fight rape
This week ' s historic hearings should determine whether 28 men and women will be brought before the army for the charge of non-intervention of rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, first grade, was reported to have been raped by her colleague at night for 25 years and 11 weeks for pregnancy.
It was in October 2008 that she returned to her barracks at the Airfield of Miramar, north of San Diego after dinner with her friend and met a male fellow who had a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Texas's crop took off her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct then."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man came to her back, fell and raped, she claims.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and another 27 current and former soldiers will be struggling to wait for the judgment of the court at the historic hearing to be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the action they filed against the former Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld have not been able to deal with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The complaint filed in February by Susan Burke from Washington, D.C., originally included 17 plaintiffs, but grew up to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men who all claim that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow workers, and that the army had not duly investigated, prosecuted or ensured justice after alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted at the top of the army because the problem begins with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Burke also said that, since February, some 400 other victims had been contacted, many of whom could participate in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she'll open a lot of things if she needs to keep the pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence under the leadership of the Federal Prosecutor Neil McBrayd took steps to discontinue the case.
The Judicial Documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mainly consisting of the fact that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court decision of Doctrine Ferez, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in the military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still formally prohibited to participate in battle, this division is only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, women soldiers' teams play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
Result: Between the two wars, 150 women soldiers, two thirds of them in battle, died.
It's time for the army to become modern, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle; three others are in addition to her claim.
At the Yale School of Law, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academies in charge of promoting a women's hate atmosphere.
A separately non-profit association of American veterans of war in Viet Nam is preparing a complaint against the army, in which the diagnosis of “personal change” that is being treated as victims of violence to remove them from service is a common phenomenon, according to such activists as Anu Bhagwati of the human rights group, the Organization of Women Military Action.
Its group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing it of discriminating treatments against people who claimed to have been subjected to sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures have been introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives of both parties.
In 2010, according to data from the Ministry of Trafficking Prevention and Control of Sexual Violence, 3.158 attempts to rape were reported.
But it is known that the attacks are often not reported, and according to Pentagon, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases reached the court, twice as fewer than in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case refer to attacks against them only as the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to explain the details of rape separately to policemen, doctors and commanders 11 times.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge in a hearing during which she was asked whether she had sex with her friend earlier the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was playing now, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric office, and when I left, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a change of identity, which made her unworthy to service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavourable language, which prevented her from obtaining any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her suitmates is a difficult question, says John Terley, a professor of law at George Washington University's Law School.
However, he notes: “I believe they are in a position to move forward.”
The doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared stands between them and the verdict.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferez all my life.
The army has been retreated for decades because it has no incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds: “Shances are largely against them... but it is important for them to try.”
These things will change only when good people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform,” she says.
Or until we die, depending on what's going to happen before.
The walls have eyes: How do researchers study you on Facebook?
Before becoming a new face of right extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Brejvik was a regular guy outlining his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which claimed 77 lives, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Breivik was able to act alone, he was far from alone on the network; he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer with millions of nationalists who support the right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how can we find them?
It's easy to just go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was easy to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on the European cyber populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The personal data reserve on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketologists have done for several years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then promoted advertising, but instead of showing a new group or a dietary product, the advertising offered the user to undertake a survey on the level of their education, attitudes to violence and optimism regarding their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants from 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries were able to interview without even leaving the office.
"This is a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not as amazing as those of right-wing groups, mostly male youth, dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and politicians use the site to study everything in the world, from health to social trends expressed in Laikhs, postes on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries per day, Facebook's “subper-actual information” is a boom for research, increasing the number of scientific articles in the title of the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it gives the opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
"Lord, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," says Bartlett.
"FaceBook excludes all of this, you turn to them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and explore social health problems.
The latest study by Dr. Megan Morono of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students discussing their drunken vices in Facebook were much more susceptible to the risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on the subject.
Morono suggests that students, such as their schoolmates, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunken status too often.
"You can't solve the problem without detecting it," said Washington Post Dimitry Christkis, co-author Morno, and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Children's Research Institute of Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn't find otherwise."
Facebook also regularly extracts data on its users.
The website data-processing team reviewed the status and day statistics of St. Valentine, the appearance of voters in the mid-term in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (usually using information available only to them), the Cyber Freedom champions long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available to research).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, likes them, or doesn't -- in exchange for playing Scrabble with a friend in thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a research that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for offline research, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users have at least thought that a researcher can observe their profiles," says Nail Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study that he conducted in 2006 using public pages of Facebook students.
"As much as they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology then arises.
Even offline has no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
In Facebook, it is not possible to know how much information is in the profile and on the user page true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook is two completely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite its years of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and the pen are still the best research tools available to use.
"Nothing can replace the way out in real peace and communication with real people," he says.
"Social research is believed to be social, and most of the social studies are still offline."
Clean and Inhuman: Anders Bering Brejvik will be brought to court for the first time publicly.
Anders Bering Brejwick, a man who confessed to an organization of a double attack, which killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter for “opposing” during the first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Knights of Tamplier Norwegian”, he said before 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit actions, but I don't admit guilt."
Judge Torquiel Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monology because he did not want to give Brejvik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own opinions.
For the same reason, he refused to allow Braviek, who had delivered a written speech with him, to contact the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nessheim also ordered the police to hold Braywick in custody for another 12 weeks, banned his access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of victims attended the hearing.
Some have come in the hope of looking in the eyes of Braviek, others to make sure it's held under the castle.
All came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," he told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors in Utah.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little easier when I saw and heard the suspect."
Breviek, dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, kept calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he came in and out of the building.
Despite the strange idea of Breivik that he was part of the great opposition movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane and said that there was no evidence that he was working with his associates.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but that's not the way," said the relative of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, which is shown in this week's theater
Following the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Innovator of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can count as the greatest discovery in a newly discovered interview, which they remember in advance of the preliminary performances in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and in production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and thought he was a hippie, but he was also a pre-sound organizer and a modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from "the pains to think that a really big idea is 90% of work... [but] a great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skillful work."
Back in 1995, Bob Cringley created a TV series of Triumph Nerds on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Jobs was expelled from Apple, and he had already worked in his new NeXT computer company in anticipation of the massive development of the Internet.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nards, he says the original interviews were missing in transport.
Only after Job's death was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This renovated material, a little edited, was the basis for the 68-minute film of Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which comes to Landmark Theaters on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person known for his hatred for the detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually ready here to outline his technology philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are big intervals between questions and answers -- meditation for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more precisely.
There are also points where Jobs' perfectionism goes to the surface, where he seems to be annoying Kringley's issues, which make him move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Era Pyxar, the ipods and the iphons of Lost Interview, there's something ominously prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies do correctly and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technology.
One thing is to read about the death grades of Jobs' work, but there's something inspiring and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, a worrisome dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of the seven significant findings of the lost interview:
About how he learned how to lead the business:
"For all the time in the business I've been asking, "Why do you do this?" and the answers you always get, "Oh, that's just what's happening."
No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, no one thinks very deeply about business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize the reporting in Apple.
Disappointed by the method of recording costs often beginning with "standard costs" that were taken from the ceiling and then elevated by "declining," he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they could track the business costs up to the small ones.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs describes in detail the blue box that he roamed with Steve Woznyak, a device that enabled people to effectively break up the phone company and call for long distances free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' euphoria here, in describing the blue box as an act of power is contagious.
He tells us how he and Vozniak tested a box using a phone-automat, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connect as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've been yelling in a cell phone, and it's caught a minute later in a neighboring cell phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned is that we could do something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could baffle a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think without it, it could ever be Apple.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous exit that he and Vasniak had done practically by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking Pope's phone to try to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two were laughing just before the pope was raised to answer on the phone.
Enrolment in technology (and the cold proclamation of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hulett in his phonebook and called him in his frequencies.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a summer work in Hewlett Parkard.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP staff who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw the "the first desktop computer."
He was the size of the suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often traveled to HP by a teenager and spinning around the car and writing programs for it.
On improvised innovation:
In a few places, Jobs' interviews tell us that new products are being invented on the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went out to sell a handful of fees, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
While working only 30 days in credit, he had to think about the collection and delivery of ready devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments... they shouted at me that it would take five years to build a mouse that would cost $300, and I was washed my throats, and I went out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
On large companies that lose energy:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs had accurately foresaw how many industry leaders would be wrong in seeing the situation and would lose control over their share of the market.
"Let's say you work in IBM or Xerox, so you do the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Selling and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually come to power by companies, and the producers are pushed away from the decision-making area.
The product, which led to this monopolistic position, is crowded out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire information technology industry.
He could be ten times as much as he could be a Mikerosofft of the '90s...
They were defeated by the victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skillful work... when you twist a big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her thinness.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your mind -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
Ultimately, everything comes to taste -- everything comes to trying to express itself to the best that people have ever done, and later to try to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what McIntos made famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had come to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are lunching with opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day that the Supreme Court met with closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question whether it would hear the revocation of the law on the health of President Obama, his two judges, Antonine Scalia and Clarence Thomas, held for lunch sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case before the highest court.
This case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss petitions.
One case on the agenda was a motion supported by 26 states that challenged the rapid revision of health care adopted by Congress last year, a law that united the conservative activists of the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the turning debate of 5 1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at the very dawn of the court decision.
A lawyer who would be tried and argue that the health law should be repealed would probably be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney-General at the time of President George W. Bush.
The Clement Legal firm, Bancroft PLC, was one of almost two dozen firms who helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group continually upholding conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the Pflizer's pharmaceutical giant Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the raid.
The lunch was held at Washington Hotel a few hours after the court meeting in the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponents of the health law.
Honorable guests for lunch?
Nothing new: Two judges have been attending the activities of the Society of Federalists for many years.
This is not inconsistent with ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were subject to them, they might have been subject to Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judges may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honourable guest, or referred to in the programme of such activity.”
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with a large financial interest, was sufficient to signal ethics activists in the Government.
“This is a shocking violation of the ethics and indifference to the code, contrary to the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"They drank and suppered on the official money-gathering action with the lawyers whose cases are currently before the court."
Their emergence and assistance in the collection of money for this activity undermines all declarations of impartiality and is inadmissible.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix the cases with groups such as the Society of Federalists.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives argue that this is a ethical issue against Judge Helena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the primary legal service in the Obama administration, when the first court objections were filed at the level of the first court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Cagan did not show that she was going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 million order on planes
Emirates' airline orders 50 broad-füsel Boeing 777 and maybe orders another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the transaction size is more than $1 billion.
It's hardly the news that the company gets orders for 50 pieces of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. plane builder, and the pre-scort price for all of these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It is equally important where Boeing was ordered: the Middle East, the growing gold, lived for future orders on the planes.
In a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company calculates that the Middle East will need 2.520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on these weekends his largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft -- 50 two-passing Boeing 777 planes.
An incredible order was received from the Emirates Airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to purchase 20 additional aircraft that will raise the total prey price to $26 billion, Boeing said to Aviashou Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which could be a much better fuel saving and passenger convenience.
The preyscorant price for six planes would be over $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said the Morningstar Nile Dior.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many of the Middle East airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have money to pay for the planes but they also have increased fuel prices that are usually detrimental to the airlines because it is one of the largest objects of expenditure that are not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the orders when the prices go up, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates' command strengthens Boeing leadership in the broadfluorinal airplane market and helps prevent the airbus SAS rival from attacking his airliner A350.
Boeing's victory on the airshift took place four months after Airbus had declared that he would postpone the largest A350 debut, which rivals exactly from 777 to 300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the autumn load after buyers demanded to increase the volume and range of the flight.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico evidently lost the election in Michoacan
Louise Maria Calderon argues that drug dealers helped opponents Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the pre-election race.
President Felipe Calderon's sister did not seem to have implemented her application for Governor Michoacan during the violent public elections, and she stated on Monday that drug dealers had helped to incite a race in favour of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results include the name of Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, as the leader of the West State Governor.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoacan but also for the whole country,” said Luiza Maria Calderon on radio interview the following day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our electoral officers... they grabbed urns to vote, put obstacles... and forced people to vote" for the IRP.
The IIR managed Mexico for seven decades until the Presidentship was lost in 2000.
She's preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this attempt.
IRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallecho seems to have slightly overthrown Calderon, who led the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a national action candidate or the PNI led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallecho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate for the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DDR, now owned by the Governor ' s chair, came to the third, a serious defeat for the divided and failure left before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept preliminary results.
Vallecho, the former mayor of the capital of Morelle, denied the links with drug traffickers and encouraged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacana, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long been dominated.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to start a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence has continued.
The mayor was killed a week before the elections when he was arriving for Luiz Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local election race because of fear.
For the IRP, however terrifyingly, the elections in Michoacana will give the party a driving impetus.
The man who was supposed to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valleho and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the next year's commencement."
ABI convince Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to being ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term downturn that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajt Nag, director of the ADB office in Manila, said that two of the fastest-growing economies should “make all they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at the difficulties of Europe “indifferently” and said that Asia's financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"They're all concerned."
“That is why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he said in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but may not be unduly vulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy ' s borrowing funds had increased threateningly, and the Prime Ministers both Italy and Greece had resigned.
The crisis in Europe had created fears that it could bring the world economy back to recession and had led to the call for the leading developing economies to meet together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg foretold that any Asian assistance would be conducted through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance bonds, provided an enormous force for the negotiations of Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce in India, said that India would do all it could to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing the decline in exports and the decline in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we have to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not possible, it's a prerequisite, because where we find work for tens of millions of our youths."
Others argue that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varshni, a professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult politically to assist Europe for the Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live by 2 dollars a day or less.
"They will find out at some point that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go to the holidays to the sea, and that will not be accepted well," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why Indian reserves should be used to accommodate Greek and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, lost enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the Eurozone crisis threatened with “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
The ADB projection of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 was now faced with “positive risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital flows from their economies.
The fearful warnings of Pentagon on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panetta, escalated the situation on Monday, in Congress, warned that the expected automatic budget reductions would undermine national security and would lead to a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
Pentagon has already experienced a reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now fearful that an additional reduction of 600 billion or more can be inevitable if the Congress cannot reach an agreement on expenditure.
“The consequences of these reductions will be destructive to the Ministry”, said the Panet in a letter to the Senators of the Republic of John McKayn, Arizona, and to the Republican of Lindsi Greham, South Carolina.
He said that the congress's failure to adopt a budget agreement and that the so-called sevester had resulted in a general decline of 23 per cent and the cessation of many new projects.
"Such a strong reduction that is so thoughtless will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfulfillable -- you can't buy three quarters of a ship or building -- and cause serious damage to other modernization attempts," wrote the Senators.
"We also have to fire many of our state employees and, since the reduction will be done so quickly, we will almost certainly have to dismiss the state to achieve the goal."
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to the warfare.”
The abbreviations will eventually affect the military, said Panetta.
“While military funding in foreign emergency operations is not affected directly by a Sequette, military achievements will be seriously affected by a serious breakdown in the core budgets”, warned Pannett.
“The contractual staff will be reduced, ending with the cancellation of contracts and the contract of oversight that supports troops.”
“The staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support would be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Panette 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The result of the Sectist in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power.”
"We stand firm against this dragon act," informed the senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they published a letter from the Punetta.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose ourselves."
“The Section is a threat to the national security of the United States and cannot be allowed to happen”.
Whether the letter of the Panetta or the latest warnings of the Senators would lead to budgetary compromises or would enhance calls for Pentagon's release, we shall see later.
The Panetta was absolutely frank about possible reductions, although he had been working in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary reviews in Congress and the White House and aware that it was faced with a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a deplorable picture of what could follow further -- troops with a shell, but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless unit."
"This is the wing of the plane without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," said Panette in his opening remarks in Pentagon.
"It's a force that suffers from a volatile war spirit, a bad willingness, and is incapable of fighting potential enemies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McKane and Graham Pannett, new details of how the reductions “sufficient operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and catastrophes; seriously limiting our ability to be the first to be deployed and reacted worldwide; and leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations”.
And the Panetta said that some of the biggest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some were only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single striker F35, a planned new bomber, a ballistic submarine of a new generation, a new coastal warship and a new ground warfare vehicle that the Army and the Marine Infant need to replace the Hammer.
The end of the further development and testing of F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Lie
A fleeting view of the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republicans, Herman Kane, is engaged in a challenge to several women ' s allegations of sexual harassment; each party is accusing the other of a lie.
The Pennsylvania University administrations were charged with false witnessing because they allegedly concealed that the retired soccer coach had raped the boys.
Last week, President of France Nicolas Sarkozi was caught when Barak Obama, U.S. President, on the microphone included, told him that Israel's Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
False ruins careers and shocks countries.
The Congressman of New York and the Internet expeditionist Anthony Weiner put himself up as a fool, denying his derivatives, which was quickly counterfeited by indisputable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during the harassment campaign.
Again, none of those who lived at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton who finds himself lying about their sexual relations with Monica Levinsky during his second term of posting.
The story of fraud in school and college is normal.
There were instances in which teachers gave students the answers to the tests so that they could have a good assessment of their performance.
Teachers who must teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
One day, research shows, you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other.
Identification of lies or lying is the necessary skills for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, let's say, the shalades, where you call "Fall!", the detection of lies is a serious course of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the last six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of falsehood have been developed.
Liars look in their eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, red, or drown.
It should not be concluded that the liars are hard to notice and hard to expose.
Experienced detector of falsehood can come to the truth by observing the structure of allegations, the mimics, the structure of questions and the time-frames.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a wide-ranging and ever-growing segment of knowledge of lies, and it is clear that the detection of falsehood is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include revolving, interviews, negotiating or governance.
Fine liars are well able to read others, making them feel unforced, controlling their own emotions and intuitively as others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraвертs lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women -- about others -- usually to protect someone's feeling that married people are less liarable to their partners than unmarried (but the lie they say is most often naked).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty by deceiving you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "defining the initial state."
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing the changes further.
Observe the grace, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
You would be glad to know if a person is standing in a regular state, then you will not make unjust accusations when you see feet knocking in the middle of the meeting.
Then seek groups of deceptive verbal and non-verbal acts.
Think of these groups as red flags, not as proof of deception.
Lyingers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet in the direction of the door, lean on the exit, change their posture in some way, or show “the relief after interview” -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
The investigators often fake the questioning signal to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at the talk of your object.
Scott Petersson is known to have retreated and used the past, claiming that his dead wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
The targeted people can also use distance in speech, "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski," or to repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely caught.
Someone can use "qualification language" when answering the difficult question, "Okay... truthfully... how much I know... how well I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than the actual one, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect a lie, but it is possible to learn how to detect a lie.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to be a victim of skilled guinears in professional and personal life.
The controversy plan for the oil pipeline needs to be revised after the US threat to postpone its approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, arousing the anger of trade unions, but reassuring environmental advocates, the company going to build the oil pipeline asserts that it will readily revise the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday night that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Peach Hills in Nebraska and that it would still receive approval.
The company made this decision at a press conference in the State of Nebraska Capitol.
The representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company was confident that it would eventually receive approval on the oil pipeline, although on another route.
This occurs following a statement by the Department of State last week that he will defer a federal decision until he explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Peschna Hills and Ogalala area, a huge underground supply of water.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expert commissioned by the Department of State would likely withdraw a decision until 2013, after the next year ' s elections, although the authorities denied that the decision had been policy-oriented.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as an appeal from the Department of State and expressed its support.
The oil pipeline is 1,700 miles long from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transport 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta Province to petroleum plants in Texas.
To do so, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental defenders, but he is loved by trade unions that hope for some 20,000 jobs associated with the oil pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed the plan are considering the bill to expedite the movement from the Sand Hills and the Ogalalla area, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the Department of State on Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source of energy in the industry stated that the Auditor of the Department had ordered a separate review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was a adviser in Hillari Clinton's 2008 campaign, is a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was whether the firm that had been hired to conduct an initial study was inappropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty La Belle was brought to court for allegedly causing the child sickness from fear.
The New York City family argues that the disco wonder of Patty La Belle began to burst into the lobby of their home in Manhattan, frightening their little daughter to the extent that it was so scared.
The tirada of the Lady Marmalade executive frightened the 18-month Geneva Monk so much that she carried “a change of personality, sleep disorder” and “a strong fear of strangers”, says her family to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This was on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, child garden tutor, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Rosanna Monk went down in the lobby of a building on the Riverside bulwark with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and dropped her daughter on the floor for a minute.
"Someone came to me back and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle has rudely made her speech to a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, "You shouldn't have left your daughter behind the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you're talking or thinking."
She was angry and began to use abusive speech -- the word C and the word F -- in high tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle on me.
She said that Genevieve had a hysterical start.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the baby.
La Belle threw herself on her mother, who was still holding Geneva, and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanne Monk.
The baby cried so much that she was touched, she added.
Later, the family sent Labelle a note of apology but did not receive a reply.
Lawyer and representatives of La Belle do not respond to comments.
The amount of compensation for the injury is not reported, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free of charge and that the family was planning to donate any money that would receive to the charity of the children with cancer.
"Purpose is to make Patty Labelle responsible for his actions," said Davis.
“This conduct is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child-education institution with an 18-month child on hand.”
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's rule, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign financing declined and the economy had been weakened.
2011, which will be part of the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also called the year of change, which has created high hopes for economic development, but given the unfavourable climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but the decline in the main indicators of economic development has been recorded.
The low temperatures of February not only resulted in millions of losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the potential for growth in the public economy by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the historic decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which had had an impact on the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by the cold provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were affected in whole, while the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state until November, according to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated rate of unemployment increased, from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa, with an increase of 4,53 per cent of the economically active population, to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September, it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, the percentage of more than 74,000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, an increase of 18.969 compared with the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been addressed by many factors over the course of the year, for economist Gerrardo López Cervantes, Director of the Autonomous University Economics and Social Sciences Faculty (UAS), unemployment growth can be explained indirectly by actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to a number of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market, to limit the resources imposed by the law adopted at Congress to combat money-laundering, because those who own dollars are not easy to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopes Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state looking for work abroad in the United States has been limited, especially because of the complexity of entry, and the second, because, once they have entered, they are already facing a lot of difficulties in finding jobs, so that a group of people stays and demands jobs here, in the state, as a result of increasing unemployment," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is worse by drawing attention to the large number of violations that prevail in labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State is working without being mentioned as employees in any institution of social protection.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities, a further reminder of the state ' s employment is provided by low wages; in the state, the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Welfare Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was by September 5,352 pesos, much lower than the average of 7,375 pesos in the country.
FDI Reduction
In addition to the downturn of economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years has been recorded, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July of the State ' s FDI, amounting to $630,697, representing a decline of 87.74 per cent over the amount of $5,143.312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government has recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which have largely come from service companies.
Long
Against the background of the economic downturn, the State Government requested, in July, the State Congress, credit approval of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revitalize the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez shows a lack of capacity for the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was no need to agree on the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, it has to work hard to get back the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all, and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
Deceleration of the economy
López Loredo said that events such as early frosts had stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth had been limited.
“The shortest amounts of the economy are the result of several events, including the cold, one of the main effects of a slow economy, which is not becoming fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, consequently, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Theodora Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employees of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we found that we were working on it, we believe that a long-term programme that will redetermine the direction and economic course of the state is needed to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of identifying a future direction to better guide the Government ' s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current Administration had demonstrated progress in its own manner of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more needs to be done," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and 100 days ' income fine, such sentences were handed down to Navolato for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against health, had been storing a marijuana for the purpose of disseminating.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrol of Cyprusano Valdes, before No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white peak car, where he was carrying a black bag in a car box and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizures were transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be held in the Centre for Support of the Legal Effects of Crime.
Contributions should be made to work
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Salvation of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being unfinished or overdue due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, while working programmes were still being developed, they were at risk, as the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be paid by the State, and that only the Federation and the Municipality had so far provided resources for work, so there was still a delay in completion.
"They're supposed to invest almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they didn't give us any penny when they were supposed to give us a part," he said, "because we didn't postpone, we started our work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not make the contributions it had to make, so that at the beginning of the term of government, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, which had not been paid to the administration of the State.
"It happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial opportunities for participation, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state had to do," he explained.
While the state authorities had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villaréal, to increase efforts so that the interest concerned could come as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year ends, they didn't give us any penny."
The Court will approve the digital television transition in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of similar signals on digital is one of the most important changes that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (VC) dismissed the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transfers the so-called “digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes necessary for its revocation.
The Minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issued a decree detailing the actions to move to digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected by the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to make a constitutional or non-constitutional decision, and it remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Moon and Sanchez Cordero voted for the project.
On this argument, both Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein regarding the digital broadcasting.
The Ministerial Meeting also decided to reject the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, and also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive power could not define the general rules of measures to which the public administration should prepare.
“I also do not believe that if that happened, it would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulator,” and recalled that State policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive branch with the constitutional mandate, government.
The replacement of analogue signals on digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean deferring the benefits of converting to digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which has not only technical dimensions, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, “requires the work of the entire system established by the principle of public economic administration, which includes a group of authorities that the Constitution brings together the State executive power.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcasting process and had done so through the executive, despite the existence of narrow technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, enforces the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere.
In Michoacan, analyze the possibility of counting the voice.
According to the PRRA, the difference between the first and the second seat in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes of the total number of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of calculating the “voice” is real with regard to the electoral process in Michoacan this year, where, according to the preliminary results of the elections programme (PRSP), the difference between the first and the second seat in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes of the total number of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacana (IUM), Maria de Los Angeles Lianderal Saragosa, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date for their entry into force in the electoral process, and the Governor of Leonard, Year Rangel, did not include his publication within the time limit specified in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (SSC) decided on a constitutional claim filed by the local legislative assembly and referred to the “non-active and illegal” vote of the State representative on constitutional reform because he was not entitled to “decision or support”.
In an interview on the possibility of a “voice in voice”, Maria de los Angeles Lianderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles, the General Council of the IIA would be able to present a partial or full counting of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recosting of one or more electoral urne may be made on conditions that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the Urine or not in the chairperson; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the general recosting of votes in all urnaments in the elections may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winner candidate and those who have obtained the second seat in the vote is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or a coalition that has made the second of the candidates mentioned.
The total votes will also be recosted if at the end of the usual calculation it is determined that the difference between the winner and the second candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken the second place in the event that the electoral umbrella that has been taken into account on partial recosting will be excluded.
It is worth noting that there are elections in Morelia where, according to PRRA, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, without even counting 129 votes in the total number of 923.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirming the family.
Felippe Basio Cortez's remains arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday night; on Monday, an examination and a calm Mass was conducted.
According to the family, the Colonel’s last will was that his ashes should be dispersed in the mountains of Sapalinam.
Following the condolences of other people who had died in the disaster, the Bassio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coauila on board the Mexican Air Force, and the most closest people visited the Ceremony in Kampo Marta.
During the afternoon, the colonel’s ashes arrived at the chaplain at Nazario Ortiz García’s bulwark, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he undertook a study of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school school classmates and a football team who was a member of Felipe Basio during secondary school.
"His desire was to return to Saltillo, and his ashes were scattered in the mountains of Sapalina, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortez Basio, a pilot sister.
In her opinion, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, and she felt that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother who was loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Bassio, a very young man, left the city of Saltillo to go to the Sapopana Air College, Khalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said he had a head spinning even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew, Jorge Alberto Davila Basio, remembers him as a very good man, "as long as he was the only one who came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to welcome him when he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan for a ceremony of his relative’s diplomas, so he knows that his uncle died by doing what he loved most in his life — driving the plane.
He's being guided to the last road
Felippe Cortés Bassio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technological High School, where he was studying in 1985 and making progress in his studies and sports, took him on the last way.
Basio Cortez recently died when the helicopter to which he managed was broken, along with the Registrar of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05 the remains of Basio Cortez (cremated), Saltillo ' s resident, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martínez, to the training school, where his family had already waited for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on the NL farm of Kaderateit
A few hours before the detection, the military authorities showed 11 people in the media who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot at various parts of the body with a check-up shot on the abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderate Jiménez, Nouevo Leon.
The discovery was found 1.5 kilometres [1.5 km] towards Santiago in the commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gate was opened in a village house with a wall painted in a refugee and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three feet [3 m], they discovered the bodies of three people, they immediately gave the authorities to know them.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and another man in a white shirt was next to him.
In almost one meter, the body of another person, in a red shirt, and in blue jeans.
All three were lying in their faces downstairs.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there was no guilder on the ground.
There are signs at the fence of a village house addressed by one organized criminal group of another, and there are several bullet holes in the gate.
11 Caderate caught
The Ministry of National Security has submitted 11 persons, including minors, who were part of a criminal group which operated mainly in the municipality of Kaderate and who are accused of abductions, murders, “fraids” and secret graves.
According to the information published, eight persons were detained in Los Alvero colony on 11 November, and one person who had been hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a phone, requiring members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event occurred on November 12, at 6 p.m., the military personnel patrolled the village of Old Rancho in Kaderate when they saw a car with two men in the caderate.
By stopping them and carrying out the inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Praud, which, when witnessed to the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret graves in the municipalities of Heneral Teran, Hin and Kaderate.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face the crisis that jeopardizes the country's economic catastrophe.
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face the crisis that jeopardizes Italy and damages the entire eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Georgeo Napolitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrates, although it is not clear when the new executive authority will take its position.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
“I wish to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this difficult period,” said the former European Commissioner to the reporters.
Monty did not expressly say that he had been able to form the Government, but the tone of his comments showed that obstacles had been overcome.
"Structural is now well defined," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than normal, since Italy has fought a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level.
The Administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner of Monty, should approve the rigid savings package required by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
On the basis of pressure on Monty to speed up, volatile markets have established revenues from Italy ' s BTP bonds for 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to save.
Emma Marcegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Emma Emcheshalia employers, told reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance of Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's success chances were largely based on the support of the LDF Silvio Berlusconi party, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alphano, Secretary of the centritist right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because to date many of its members have opposed the Government ' s majority of technocrats that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will likely be unpopular reforms of rigid economies.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure to warn that Monty’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began its consultations with political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish his meetings on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would be resigned, Italy's debts had now reached a critical level against the backdrop of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
The saving of Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist prior to the next 2013 elections, despite widespread projections that policies would only allow him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he wished to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that it should be drawn up only from technical expertise, and that they were discontented that the process was affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that the mutual mistrust and dissent of parties made it difficult to include political figures.
Spaniards have more experience in playing than Ticos
Of the 22 players claimed in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
Costa Rica has only one of the 22 players claimed to play 50 matches.
The small contrast with Costa Rica by comparing 22 players caused by both countries to join today at 3:05 on the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rating, have a whole list of class A selection games, Tricolour has only the advocate of Michael Uman as the only one who has spent 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) at the Romel Fernandez Stadium.
The Spanish football players playing the League of All Stars and the British Blue Clubs have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Championes.
To that end, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish van in complex qualifications in the Euro or World Championship.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish collecting holkiper Iker Cascilas, who last Sunday v. England (the 0-1 winner in London) repeated the record of Andona Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Cassillas will play against Tricolar today and set up a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Havi Hernández, Barcelona player, 106 matches.
Kassilas and Havi were recognized as the best last week of UEFA, along with another Iberian team player, Subisareta, with 126 matches and Shalke Raul González, with 102.
It's almost close to 100, Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them from 91, Fernando Torres from 90, David William and Serhio Ramos, both from 81, Andres Injesta from 62, Cesus Fabregas from 61 and David Silva from 53.
Costa Rica is close to Mikhael Umana, the left-hand Junior Dias with 48 matches and the bomber Brian Ruis from 45.
Then, only five of them crossed the border of 30 games: Kaylor Nawas from 31, Randall Asofeif from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36 and José Luis Lopez from 35.
The others.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Serhio Busketsa (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks from 26, Gabriel Budilja from 25 and Roy Muri from 23.
The remaining did not reach even 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two games, Victor Boliver has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain’s leader David Villa with 50 heads followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet included the country in a tour of 20 years of career
A visit to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exclusive interview by Viva Basist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It was over 20 years of expectation, but the group says that it is also a dream that has become a reality to play in that country.
This was a statement by Basist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave Viva from Brazil an exclusive interview last week.
The group is in South America as part of a tour of 20 years of work and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20.
On that day, they will attend the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with a team from Los Angeles The X and a local group of Las Robertas.
It's an excerpt of a conversation, whose full deciphering is available online at The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, this is the dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A visit to Costa Rica is a dream that has taken place for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's going well for the moment.
I was in Costa Rica only once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking about it because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live in tense days before the concert.
What will you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for having been with us all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, view it as the largest show of the year.
Does that add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we've played in the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great show in São Paulo and we hope that this has led us into the formation of this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love Serfing and the jungle, with regard to these two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of sergeants, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go to Serfing in Costa Rica and in Nicaragua, and in Mexico, this is a great place for surfing, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say you made great shows with a lot of songs.
What'd you plan for the Costa Rican presentation?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We're going to try to make a better show of possible songs with a wide variety of songs; we're going to try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tonus and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting to us, and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour you've been marking 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe all that you've done?
Yes, of course.
First, I think none of us could ever imagine that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck, and we are deeply encouraged by the fact that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and we like to make music.
We're happy to ride around the world where we always wanted to go.
It's very good for us.
What does it mean to be a significant part of the border?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group from one city appears, but much stranger when five or ten groups appear at one time in one city.
We are also proud of being part of the Sietle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with all of them, and for us the honor of being part of the sound of Seattle that came out.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer in itself than many groups exist.
First, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and secondly, we're caring for others.
We're all very close friends, and we've also opened up musical roads that give everyone the freedom of experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not be better.
Your view of the word was not easy; but your success made it possible for you to do what you wanted.
How do you balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to balance.
We care not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you've done without choosing to be famous and to be a rock star, something that none of us cares seriously.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a group of almost three years and didn't release any album, until Andy died.
There's been a lot of disappointment because it's been so long, and the most important thing that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferрвеzer) and Graham (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think of an incredible person who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
It was a great man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
It's true that you know her job, especially Eddie Woodder, and so you chose her to open her?
Yeah, the producers sent us a few videos, and this was a group that we liked most, so we're eager to see that Las Robertas can offer us an inferior, and that must be very exciting.
Why do you always change words to Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's the question of Eddie Leader, so I don't know.
He sings her, and I think he's using the first thing he gets into his head.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entville, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the basists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the border's validity despite being no longer fashioned?
I think we're all feeling some sort of undue.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was more gloomy, and now it's become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because I think there's a couple of songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very grim, though they might sound a little positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and you've had some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these things start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that to me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State Hospital, and his family doctor reported that he had been tested for the loss of muscle force.
Fuhimori, 72 years old, sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for human rights violations committed during his administration (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including the cancer of the language, which resulted in four operations and being monitored.

Milka goes to Mexico to strengthen political linkages
The official delegation, chaired by President Uruguay José Muhika and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Mushica will meet on the following Wednesday with her Mexican colleague Felipe Calderon, the most important item of the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the timetable published by the Uruguay leadership.
The meeting of the two Presidents in Guadalahar City will be “favourable to exchange information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muchika seeks support from Calderon for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozi included the South American country in a letter of tax harbour at the G20 meeting in the French city of Kan.
In his speech, Sarkozi threatened to remove those countries that remained tax harbors from the international community, a statement that raised a protest by Uruguay and a revocation for consultations with his Ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing a group of the most highly developed and developing countries since November in G20 and has, in fact, a tax-sharing agreement with the South American country since January of this year to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to expedite the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave this grey list of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn from countries that do not enjoy international standards of tax cooperation.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has increased trade trade between the two countries.
The wet water supply will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil legs of Bozer, but never before did it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he'll fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The publication that will appear in shops around the world this month was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows for three measurements without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero to tell you how a stereoscope would work without points," said the Nintendo Press Service head in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of a game in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed under this platform", because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adapting existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that despite the existence of 3D, “Super Mario 3D Land” is a “accessible” video game that allows for a quick and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simply" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "two round" to the level of the game, which is this time more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between “D aggressive” or the one that affects only the depth of the operation but which needs to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome various obstacles and “do not give in to optical illusions”.
This incursion by Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo twinks the fans of the Serial and repeats a successful formula from the previous games, the water supplyer and the moustache needs to go through dangerous mined platforms to release Princess Pić.
However, the player will find new movements, decoration, suits and enemies, as well as Luigi's “player. ”
Colom guarantees Portilla extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the Alfonso Portilla extradition process had begun to respond to the United States for a laundering plot of $70 million.
This is the end of the process at which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo in order to judge him there.
At the press conference, Colom said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, bearing in mind that the court of first instance had already signed extradition.
He argued that, during his mandate, he did not “take hands” to legal decisions and took all extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Together with Portillo Serhio Ruano Marroquin, both Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estradez, both will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury.
What Kolom did shows the execution process after all the legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of the State from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CS), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the execution of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential period, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and opened the case again.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of the social support organization Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped to overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added.
The Yearbook provided an opportunity for a ceremony held at an old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared next to Trinity Velia in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or vulnerable to marginalization.
The Sunday celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that had cooperated with the association during those 25 years.
The different political perception during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the General Assembly, Arthur Masa and his predecessor, Hordi Puchol, an ex-consultant of Socialist education, Ernest Maragal, and ex-Leutenant mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council of Rickard Goma, visited the ceremony.
At Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josép Lewis Cleris, and SEO Social Workers La Caixa, Hame Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove had emerged in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far was “a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and of the hope for people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to her organization and work," he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
Invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the Balmez Street building, 51
12 occupants left the building yesterday afternoon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare of neighbors living in 51 Balmez’s home came to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass gatherings that irritated neighbours by court decision without police interference.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent a repetition of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a check-up here," said the manager.
The squitters that captured 11 out of 13 floors of the building, the rest of them settled, all electrical power and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of different kinds, especially banks from alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Immediately behind the building is the nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income had dropped by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the invaders engaged her in an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at a club of 10.
In addition, the disco owner had to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbours, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the visitors to the club, but by the Squot residents and, above all, by those who attended the gatherings that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the disastrous neighbours said.
The owner of the club said that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it's been nine months in which he's "forgiving" her rental.
The City Police also confirmed that in recent weeks there had been more complaints from neighbours about the situation.
The President of the Municipal Group of PP, adviser Alberto Fernand Dias, demanded, last week, “to evacuate the building immediately in order to address the problems of coexistence and the common spirit that emerged from and degradation in this area”.
The popular leader explained that until summer, only one floor of the building was busy, but in the last few months the squitters invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them had been hacked.
In that sense, he added that “to put an end to impunity and to resist unculturalism in the building”.
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police left Montral, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbour, who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition following the controversy of contributions
The Municipal Contest for 16 doors resumed the debate on the role of Colceola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the upturn of the Barcelona Capital Corporation (BCB), the Administration printed promo-lists for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona’s capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the UK, the park again took place in 1987 in the consciousness of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few targeted not north-south but up (hora) to the bottom (sea).
The position of the Colserol as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellouttoun, with the wild caban as Yogi bear.
That was so until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions, consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colzerol.
Under the gate is the idea of the park, of course.
Either that, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
The question is, Colserola, park or mountain?
The competition and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are the subject of all Barcelona architects.
This is hardly the most recurring subject discussed when two members of this clan are identified by the chosen people in the elevator.
This fact leads to one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who attended.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: Competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the front of the mountain, when Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"I must admit that the largest Barcelona park is a beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
"Colserola is more complex," says an architect whose heading "Colserol's gate" contains a "silver trap," and we should not think of them as "as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we should act."
The Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, described the proposal as “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from “independence of public space prediction” following the experience of the 80-x, which ended at the “lebdin songs” Forum.
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
"Consolidation of something is the preparation of the next step", which is, the transition.
“We must think of new urban planning tools, because the current [for the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to a real disaster.”
More closely, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserol Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a pure topographic question.
Modolo recalls that there is already a work done outside Calserola, which “do not miss by ears”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to enter the project “from the outset”.
And, moreover, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debates, but “he doubts whether this technical profile is what must be led by interdisciplinary teams (“success”) which should be created: “Archtors must be only a tool”.
The Byona suggests that the answer to the question that asks the title of this part is compiled, because the rules of the competition lack general Kolserola: "16 crossing competitions have been announced, he says, in the meaning of the sea-goars, but there is no long-term reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This makes at least in his case a decision to attend 16 contests.
On the other hand, the project for one gate may be intersected by programme and definition of an architect's project for neighbouring gates.
In your view, the Council is expected to guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide a full area equipped for a smooth transition between town and green.
Kazino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino judicial representative pardoned Mr. Monterrey ' s brother in the proceedings against him on the charge of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino extended his pardon to the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting a process of extortion against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly required him to pay his economic contribution to allow Monterrey authorities to operate secretly in a gambling house.
After a public conviction, the Public Attorney-General opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor and was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the capital of the State.
He stayed 49 days in this place, following the order of the second order prohibiting movement after the prosecutor had disfellowshipped the bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaderate for the alleged extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in the municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, the evidence of Yonas ' s guilt, such as the charge of 1.5 million pesos from the tugmakers in exchange for authorization of the operation, was sufficiently evident.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be free during the next hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor of the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez, whether he had reparated the damage and who of the partners in the gambling house would pardon, although counsel had tried not to speak the name.
Based on the records of 197/2011, legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and thereafter no declaration of the process that had been planned against him could be made; no reparation and punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the tractors, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to the municipality of San Nicholas in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate order of release signed by a judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacomé describes the details of the catastrophe where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MIT) reported that the results of the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Black Mora, and seven others, died, showed that the helicopter had hit the ground directly in a state of complete integrity, without attempts by the pilot to take an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Liaison and Transport, said that before the aircraft ascended, the pilot found that the weather conditions were flyable.
"Elements that seem to show that the vessel had several contacts with the land, wings contacted trees 25 meters [25 meters] where the vehicle lost the fluse."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, meeting the required requirements for the transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the target area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study reported that there were no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact was in a state of structural integrity.
"The vertex was intended for 19 passengers, meeting the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The ground in this place has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the Presidential helicopter was headed at creyser speed and that it was on a soft rise.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the usual flight manoeuvre at the time of the blow," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of SCT, Pérez Hacomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation rules, the flight was carried out according to visual flight rules, which means that the team must have a visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified suitable conditions for flight when the aircraft went to the border area between the city of Mexico and the State of Mexico, where clouds were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of the cloud conditions, the team was looking for a zone of lower height and greater visibility in the Quernavac Valley.
The place of the blow.
The impact coordinates and the latest recording from the radar of the aircraft are likely not to have occurred before the impact of the loss of control or change of flight direction.
Threshold scattered on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side line.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter had encountered the land under structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the zone of catastrophe, unseen evidence remains in the siege of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that multiple contacts with land could be made.
During the work on the ground, pieces of air vessel were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a slope of 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed on the road.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter could have had several clashes with the ground.
Following a thorough study in more territory than the marked zone near the location where the disaster occurred, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforced the assumption that the impact had occurred under structural integrity.
MSS announces the Obesity Gene search program
Social protection is headed by a study to find the gene of obesity for children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that a study was being carried out to detect the gene of obesity in children and young people, which had been called the “Genetic Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents” protocol, which would provide an estimate of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the Medical Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the Twenty-first Century, Miguel Cruz Lopez, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduates from the National Institute of Health of the NIPH and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Police Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (proposed or not) to participate in the MSSI sports centers involved in the study in the valley of Mexico City, where every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m., child-friendly tests will be conducted.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be held at a sports centre in Cuautemoka, west of Mexico City, and since 8 October, events were held at a sports centre in Nesaualcousotl, Mexico City, at the outset of Mexico City.
After the target of between 500 and 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Sports Center of Independence (Jug Mehiko) and, finally, at the Morelos Sport Centre (Norther of Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to identify a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main objective is to collect 3,000 children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 with permission from parents and under their supervision to fill individual feeding questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors leading to diseases such as diabetes or renal deficiencies.
He explained that the anthropometric measurements of all participants would be carried out on Saturday (weight, growth and coverage of the plate), blood pressure measurement and level of glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child obesity).
Cruce López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only six years of growth occurred: 77 per cent of boys suffered from obesity in the case of girls; 47 per cent in the case of overweight, there was also a significant increase,” said MSSI expert.
He said that the rationale for searching markers was based on the fact that the people of the country were different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that an average Mexican is 65 per cent descendant of American Indians, a 30 per cent descendant of Europeans and a five per cent descendant of Africans, and this condition affects genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly the result of the genetics of obesity is the inability of the organism to burn the excess of energy we consume (calories), and it is postponed as fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit to participants, which could identify whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark warehouses on the neck (acantes) and pre-trial shoulders means the likelihood of a violation of metabolism and even a pre-diabetes.
All confidentiality is addressed, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyles to be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: seated lifestyles, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using transport on small distances rather than walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbons (tamal, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a large content of fats and proteins and genetic prevalence analysed in the programme.
UNAM Asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Erera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best quality that is sustainable to environmental impacts and temperatures.
If traffic signals were given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200,000 pits for each rainy season in the capital area in Mexico City, says Rafael Errer Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalized road covers were streamlined, the number of pits could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture, the Technological View of the Pits read in the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which it is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture that is close to a bitumen, but with the best resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Erréra Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve road quality and hence to resist pit education.
He explained that the bitumen, the hardest part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of the high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others of the low molecular mass called elbows, which together provide road covers its characteristic limb - voltage behavior.
The visco-volatile behavior of a bitumen is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like liquid at 120 degrees of viscosity very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to the asphalt is not permanent but changing during the day, depending on the natural environment and temperature, said a chemical engineering specialist.
Scientist chimphacy observed that the streets of Mexico City were largely covered with flexible cover, which consisted of six layers of material, of which three of them included a bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones drained into a bitumen and then squeezed.
Every stone that is made up of this coat, he said, was loaded in battle.
In driving and in applying efforts, it helps forces to be very well distributed on road covers.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer, called the layer of wear made of a small stone, which was actually also loaded into asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels, it must have more resistance than the asphalt cover and provide a road track.
As part of the road surface to receive and disseminate these efforts, the layer of deterioration also requires proper thickness and the material from which it is prepared should be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors for consideration, especially the water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the condition of the asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water enters the surface and it's difficult to get out of it, it makes all layers of surface soften and therefore the formation of the pit.
In the formation of pits, he said, the first was the deterioration layer and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur instantly, which should be given attention to the first signs of current repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport loads were another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of surface should always be related to transport loads and it was necessary to ensure that this requirement was met in order to prevent the frequent appearance of pits.
Rafael Errera said that much still needs to be learned and done, for example, by bitumen emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even helping to make pits easily and without high temperatures.
What did a Valle candidate lack to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Meline Ramirez from getting the crown of Ms. Colombia.
The representative of Valle received the title of the Princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Caucasus had just wanted to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna was to be satisfied with the winners' symposium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
Based on the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Mission won the crown and scepter, the Department has 14 titled princesss, and Melina joins the Balie del Cauca legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but were declared princesss, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borréro Domingez (1949), Patricia Belina Ayal (1979), Larena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanca (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsuel Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabelle Rome (1993), Hisee Alhore Harcez (2007), Kathalna Harceas Alhure (2008).
The question that many now ask is:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the presentations showed that she had all to become a new Miss Colombia, was not merely elected by the Queen of the Police and by the most handsome of the Vogue versions, the titles of the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who were given the crowns of the Mission of Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she could not answer the question, "What book characterizes you and why?" by Martin Murille Gómez of the literature society, let's read.
She replied to the enquiry:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood is the little prince is a pretty deep book.
Today, I read "Privacy and Punishment," it's a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; and at this point I read the book of Irena Nemirova, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Grief."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because it did not specifically explain how each of the books quoted described it.
But after the ceremony, Melinah said that she was calm and satisfied with her outcome, "A wise man, what is to happen."
And all of you, please read a little bit, "Small Prince" is a great book."
Among the sounding hypothesis, Valle burned down from favoritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was preferred to be met with ovations, and she was a candidate who had received all the pre-primary awards (the Ostera Culinary Competition, the Audience's Better National Costume, and Queen-Matha), "that sparked the zeal of other candidates, caused stress on the queen, and as a result she did not glean on the stage."
And it was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on the beach of Hilton and during her two performances at the evening coronation.
While it seemed certain, it was evident that it lacked the energy and energy that the Magdalene and Atlantic representatives had shown.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called the Princess means that a candidate who wins more rewards during the competition does not become a queen.
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided contact with the press, and that was not the right thing to do.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Concurs of Beauty.
That is why two days before a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotty, said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Ms. Colombia, we have to look not only at the outward appearance, but also focus on public consciousness before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects," she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Valle sinned with defects on berries and fibrosis, which she saw on her belly, but that was controversial, as the jury emphasized her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her more healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
The consultant of King Jorge Ernan Orosco notes that Melina had no better body, which was better, "but the problems of fibrosis on my belly that were not very noticeable for me forced her to lose the glasses on the last day."
In the meantime, Guido Oyos of the Cromos magazine believes that the error of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgical interference.
"Operations are good, but the representative of Valle doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was first given by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the brutal prediction took place last night, saying that it was a dude whose Rymundo gave Melina as compensation for having lost her pleasure in obtaining the crown.
That is or not, the fact that Melina is now having a year of government, not as queen, but as a princess, is a position that enables her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly stated by the organizers of the National Concurs.
However, she would enter history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent presentation at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
Kali's criminalist came into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Kano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, the criminalist, CTI Kali, came into history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Head Alfonso Kano, comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI criminals this week, Elizare González, a man from Puerto Tehad, who had spent 21 years in the investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choko, where he often had to cross more than five days through the jungle to reach the location where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after the courses were completed, became a criminalist specialist in the field of skin-cracking, i.e., hands and tuna.
Elizare was told to take no more than three days for a week to identify a person known as Alfonso Cano.
Something great's coming.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten images of Guillermo Leon Sáens (it is the present name).
However, when he came with the research team to the place where the body was located, he did not identify him by outward appearance; he was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much worse.
But the prints don't lie.
Using an enlarged glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elizare compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the pictures.
His eyes weren't down. It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to Juan Carlos Pinson, Minister of Defence, that he was the leader of the PRSC.
Search fingerprints
The recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos González for a dactiloscopy team of Sijin in Kali for a press conference on Operation v. Kano is of particular importance.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, it can play a key role in the disclosure of crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, dactiloscopy experts are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder and establish the identity of detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the event of theft, he had to take away a piece of the wall of the house because the thief had to hold hands in this place to get a safe full of valuables and money.
“The walls are hard to work, because they are not convenient surfaces to take the prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and identify the criminal who took part in a number of thefts,” he says.
Printing also helps to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man with bottles from a liqueur around him was found.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a relative could have been suspected of committing the crime and that the fingerprints on the bottle were actually matched.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A CTI dactiloscopy specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent is placed at a site where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Thereafter, prints are sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or entered into the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of Colombians missing," said expert CTI.
He explained that it was not all as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves the prints on you.
However, if possible, a comparison shall be made.
“Agrieved people” challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters broke the camp in front of Zukkotti.
Part of the protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the area and went to the park nearby.
The members of the Wall Street Movement left on Tuesday to the New York authorities when they tried to retreat, under the protection of a court order, into the area of Manhattan, from which they were evacuated at dawn when they tried to capture another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters accumulated at the Zukotti area, where they wanted to go because of a court order that allowed “indignant people” to break the camp into the area while the other part of the movement responded to the raid by taking the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that, as the court prevents us from breaking the camp in the square, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle for return to Zukotti and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the "False Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Brey explained that the response of “agitated people” to the evacuation of the tentary town, which was ordered by the mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg, had come to court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued a ruling prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, “the wrathful people” have taken up a new park located at the merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Six Avenue, near the entrance of the tunnel Holland, which connects New York and New Jersey and which is owned by the Trinity church.
At least an hour they could take this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not call the exact number, he said Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The Organization assures that several hundred people were standing with tents where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to show support to the members of the movement in trying to act as a mediator in the police negotiations.
In the meantime, the Zukotti area, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a trial appointed for this Tuesday, which will address the legality of today's morning dispersion of protesters.
Some of the protesters who were sent there carried and distributed at the same time copies of the judgement and even gave copies to police guards of the area, which resulted in “some small clashes”, said Bray, who claimed that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The Judicial Ordinance prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of the Wall Street Movement and forcing the implementation of the “laws issued after the capture began, or prohibiting the demonstrators from re-regaining access to the park with stores and other property used earlier”.
The Mayor of Bloomberg told the reporters that the city had suspended the opening of the public space and the demonstrators had been informed of it, but local laws did not allow them to reopen tent stores and bedroom bags.
The municipal council member personally justified the removal of the Zukotti protesters from the Zukotti area at dawn, the operation during which some 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters “had violated the law”.
Bloomberg said that he ordered the clearance of the area because it was "the place where people came to protest, not to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people," because "some enterprises have been threatened" and neighbors feared "for deteriorating the quality of life."
The evacuation conducted this morning was disgusting and showed that Bloomberg was more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of the movement who condemned the mayor for “a lack of respect for freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize “national acts” on Thursday in cooperation with public organizations and trade unions in order to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be Deva Maria in the special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Red Russell Peters" on December 1.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in the "Big Refurbisher," a rescue officer at Malibu, Banny in Pleiboy, a rock musical wife, Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be the Dev. Maria in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private CTV telecommunication announced today that Anderson, together with the Crowner (Ballad Executioner), Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, would appear in the Russell Peters television program on December 1, in the role of Mary.
The CTV presented a television show today, where Anderson, also known for the Internet-wide home pornography video, where she represents with her husband, the drummer of the Mötley Crüe group, Tommy Lee, is dressed like Deva Maria, holding the dolls that depict Jesus.
In this stage, Peters, a famous Canadian comic of Indian descent, who recently acted as the leader of the Torrent Torpeda to the Torpedo of Truth, Charlie Shina, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian CTV singer, who married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model of Luisian Lopilato and who also knows the interpretation in scandals, participates in the special CTV Christmas show.
Recently, Bubble called the American Kim Kardashian at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, regenerated after the earthquake
GDP rose by 1.5 per cent because of domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and still recovered from the devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that has been carried out by the rising country since the Second World War
According to the Government of Tokyo, material losses amounted to $300,000 million — a blow that seems to be taking place despite the difficult world situation.
After three consecutive quarters, the gross domestic product data from July to September have clearly helped to reverse the page: GDP has grown by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent in annual calculations.
The year registered in the second quarter, the financial year for the Japanese beginning in March 2012, is also the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
Renaissance may be partly explained by the renaissance of the purchase of machine equipment to rehabilitate areas devastated by earthquake and post-tsunami tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real transformation in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen or restructure infrastructure, using falsehoods to increase from scratch.
Japan has arose mainly through the development of household consumption, which now stands at 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of increased cars, travel and rest costs.
Cleimo yen
Tokyo has provided an internal market when the yen, Japanese currency, became one of the "bullet-escapes" chosen by investors who want to rid the debt crisis in the euro area and negative projections about the United States, a privilege that will give a stone to exporting companies.
In stronger currencies, products are costly abroad, which is a serious blow to the country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sonyi, for example, blame the Yen in their low rates from July to September.
While markets continue to siege the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esichiko Noda does not decrease vigilance.
We must be attentive to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp improvement in yen, said yesterday the Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukava.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic decline in September.
The indicator, which predicts breakthroughs in the world economy, showed that the major forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurason even fell below the average of 100 points after it reached eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again give rise to doubt
Papadimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation
With the peripheral prizes for risk and uncertainty prevailing in the parks, Greece continues to wander along the labyrinth, which leads to the emergence of a large European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new Transitional Government of Ellades is imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than by the true belief of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos warned yesterday that there was no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, Antonis Samarias, the conservative party leader of the New Democracy, believed that he would not support new measures of strict savings in no case and reiterated his demand for new elections of 19 February.
The main task of the Government was to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that would end tomorrow with the confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovation.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the conservatives took one step further in his attitudes regarding the EU and IMF, organizations that should dismalize 8,000 million urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of all or nothing alleged by the Papandreu referendum in style, reiterated yesterday that its demands were unambiguous: it would not resume aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major parties of Greece did not sign the “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economics of Amadeu Altafai said that the troika inspectors could “before return to Athens” to discuss with the new Government, “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet indicated.
The Greek club will have enough threads for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen stressed the “core” of Spain with respect to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country had become the second largest donor for cooperation instruments, whose “reality”, she said, was that it was “the building blocks of social progress, justice and hope for the best future for all mankind, based on faith in humankind.”
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valyadolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially with a view to halving twice the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded.”
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and to take on this task with “responsibility”, says Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements that emerged during the summit that will continue until Thursday will “ensure the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, the “core recipients of these loans”.
There's a lot of accomplishments here and a lot of difficulties that we're facing.
The microcredit summit is not only a dispute course but also a platform that contributes to “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty therefore explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would use these financial services and that one hundred million of these households would be removed from the poverty to which they were loaded.
The impulse to the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world "has been on the way that Muhammad Yunus began" stressed Ms. Sofia as the "Act of Justice and Recognition".
And she described the father of the tool as “a impressive idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the queen had gone to Bangladesh to study its lending policy on the ground.
This experience took over the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I saw everywhere the continuous development”, said Her Majesty, whose connection with the project brought her yesterday the title “Family Head” gathered in Valyadolide by a “poor banker”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, said that solidarity was a “ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to economic boom times, as it was a “permanent commitment”.
Hymenes concluded that microcredit implies a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty”, and now “more than ever” developed Governments should work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of cost reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the “success” in giving “confidence” to the people who were “confidential in front of which all the doors were closed” and the mayor of Valyadolid Francisco Havier León de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, who “revealed their doors in the spirit of solidarity”.
The CDC proposes that the President of the Eurocommission be elected by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDF) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Mercel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but was created in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policies are far from as strict as they should be today in relation to Greece and perhaps tomorrow towards Italy....
The draft resolution on the chairmanship of the European Commission, which was presented by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The ovals stood for several minutes, which had earned Angel Mercel, and several hours later Wolfgang Schoyble, Eurofield and the Minister of Finance, had left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not only because Europe means the world, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, it's time for a breakthrough in Europe.
This could mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which would allow the European Union to strengthen its control over the financial policy of the Eurason countries, but that could also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to give Europe a person”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, whose idea evidently belongs to Wolfgang Shabble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain is opposed to that, and the leaders of the CDS believe that Nicolas Sarkosi is also opposed.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates rejected the overwhelming majority of the proposal to weigh the vote of each European member country in the European Central Bank, in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm down the situation in its party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kole, but did not seek to influence Congress through the “little” European countries or countries in a difficult situation, who like to criticize the “high” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted a whole paragraph to the importance of Hermano-French friendship, Angel Mercel had not mentioned France.
Just by way of a ride.
Reminding that two centuries ago Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Nazi army.
What is fraud with hospital leaves?
Following cash benefits, the UMP and the Government began attacking hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarkozi will arrive at Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and speak on the subject, which has been repeated since 2007, on the fight against fraud in the area of social benefits.
And in order to help that outlook, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the right-to-election campaign, most want to focus on hospital sheets.
In the first place, with regard to budget savings, the Government intends to impose on private employees the fourth day of unpaid leave prior to the beginning of the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick employee will lose his salary in four days, at a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to cause a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will result in savings of Euro280 million.
It will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without sickness benefit (state employees still have not waited for the payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day waiting of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are discussed, the majority also raise the subject of fraud, with regard to the abuse of hospital leaves.
Control will become more severe and in addition if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received”, warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital sheets.
They have indeed been under constant control and political attacks since 2002, which bear fruit.
People in France have no more pain than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a look at the figures in the country.
According to the National Medical Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economic Research and Documentation, the daily cost of compensation in 2008 of Euro11.3 million was 5 per cent of the total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were of day leave and work accidents and 54 per cent of sickness benefits, representing €6.2,000 million.
And therefore, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to Alma Consulting Group.
Average arithmetic, which conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, revealed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said that they had not taken a single day of hospital.
Another study on health insurance this time states that 37 per cent of hospitals lasted less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent from 15 days to a month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
Comparing these figures with European neighbours, it is clear that French employees are no more inclined to take hospitals than those of any other country.
A lengthy study conducted by two CNRS researchers in 2010 revealed that between 1994 and 2001 the total percentage of absences in France (or not for health) varied between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital leaves is very low compared to the “sera” of employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The increase in the law since 2002 has resulted in systematic screening of hospitals for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases verified by the CNAM, 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term diseases were “unjustifiable” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly tested hospital sheets, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “unreasonable or unreasonable”, which is equivalent to 133,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unjustified” for several million employees who received hospital leaves.
Numbers that show very few cases compared to, for example, the employment gray.
According to the UMP Dominique Tyan, the author of the report on this issue in June, they are between 9 million and 15,000 million euros of underreceived budget income per year, exceeding the total cost of daily compensation, and thus infinitely higher than fraud losses.
Papadimos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos stated this in Parliament, adding that the 100 days granted to his coalition Government had not been sufficient to carry out that task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening the debate on the confidence-building of Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euroson Summit on 27 October should be a “core task” of the new Government, since the country's presence in Eurason was“ at stake”, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country ' s budget deficit “approximately 9 per cent” of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The legal rejection of the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further strict savings.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party of New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt and combating spending, but also with his rejection of any course that impeded the recovery of the economy.
Olli Renah, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of €8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
The need to legalize evtanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, states the Committee of Experts
Canadians are denied death, approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, without considering cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code to permit suicide with foreign assistance and evtanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to take such a decision.
For the first time, experts refer to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people fear to argue about death”.
Due to medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, report experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6 per cent of them end up dying in the hospital.
The country ' s highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the delicate issue of evtanasia and suicide, the authors of the report conclude that it is contrary to the Federal Government's position that they have already stated that they do not wish to change anything in the criminal code with respect to eutanasia and suicide from outside aid.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization is a result of abuse of use, i.e. the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with foreign assistance against people who are unable or unwilling to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Joselin Downi, who presented the report, confirmed the majority of such cases in countries where evtanasia and suicide had not been legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is evidently illegal.
Self - murder is practised in Canada, where it is evidently illegal, explains Joselin Downy.
Euthanasia Canadians
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate evtanasia, because, according to annous Reid in 2010, they believe that this will help people to alleviate their suffering at the end of life.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of eutanasia will not signal that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to people who have assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less unambiguous, the authors say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to learn in a spirit of respect for refusal to take care of late life without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, health institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee demands that it be applied when it does not serve to impede physical pain such as euthanasia and is subject to the same limitations.
Comments of other experts
Some health-related legal experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the “cross” position of experts who signed the report because, among other things, it does not limit the use of eutanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age may ask for help in committing suicide, says the meter of Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place independence of the individual above all other values that constituted social tissues.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “category dissent with the findings of the report, which it called “manifest for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the reports on abuses in some countries where eutanasia and suicides are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregona.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Asada to retreat
Damascus condemns the conspiracy.
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Asad's supporters conducted a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria, Bashar Asad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns “conspiracy” against his country, increased.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbours of Syria, resigned President Asad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader yesterday, who called on President Bashar Asad to surrender power in Syria, where some forty more civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed.
“If Bashar had been expensive for his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life,” said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview by BBC.
In turn, Ahmet Davotoglu, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, regretted that the mediation efforts of Turkey, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
In the Middle East, those who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, with regard to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly rigid course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “enlargement of consensus against Asada and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly rigid course towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime were killed in the Der`a area in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died during the shooting and and fire from heavy gun guns in Jobar in the encircled city of Homs, according to the ONG.
During the press conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid Mualle, said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, and he added, assured that this conspiracy against Syria would fail."
Following its decision to delete the League of Arab States of Syria, it is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands that 500 members of the Arab organization for human rights, journalists and military observers be placed in the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alain Juppe, also expressed his support for the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from repression, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to end the crisis adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of armed forces from hostilities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, described the “incorrect” decision of the League of Arab States yesterday, while China called upon Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and victims of Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a program that would require “sacrifices” to restore the lending capacity lost in the last few months of Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate office composed of technocrates outside Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a large-scale victim programme, said Francesco Nukara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions following a meeting with the Prime Minister ' s candidate.
Speaker of the House of Deputies, Jantranko Fini, said that he would wait to know if Mario Monty's Parliament would be asked to vote before Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude by presenting Mr. Monty a limited list of dozens or about those ministers, head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nerveness of the stock exchanges and bond holders yesterday, asking them for time.
“Democracy requires time for the preparation of the Government and the programme,” he added that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but his concern was again raised, particularly after the unexpected fall of industrial production in Eurason in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included most importantly the Technocrates, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to act until 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the House of Deputies, Jantranko Fini, the new Government will receive the octopus of confidence of Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Ren, stressed that “without regard to the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, despite the strict savings plan adopted in recent months, required, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian “boss of boss” Emma Marchegal, who would meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because the country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the household by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented “a change of age” for Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “the challenge of seriousness” and “other Italy”, said by the authors of the predecessors.
The longevity of his team is a great unknown.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid the rapid elections, as by April 2012, Italy should pay $200,000 million on public debt.
Russian scientist assisted Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko assisted Iran with the development of a nuclear-weapon-friendly detonator confirmed on Monday the American atomic risk agency.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN Agency to identify the scientist.
IAEA has expressed concern last week about the “possible military aspect” of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danielenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “beginning in the sixtieth years, at the Soviet Military Nuclear Centre in Chellabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the production of synthetic diamond-based explosives”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company producing nanoalmaza in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, IAEA referred to “extreme signs that Iran's development” of a nuclear detonator system “was capable of the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology in the military nuclear programme of his home country”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence had diminished or changed slightly during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is increasing again, stresses human rights organization First, “Increasing violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization to the official communication.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious human rights violations,” added one of the leaders of the organization, Paul Leghand.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes”.
“Hate-based crimes” in the federal law are the legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was enacted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today by sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook.
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed its platform to allow its users to see the activity of those who are watching what makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and other "name" help to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitters, Internet users whose messages ("widgets") you monitor, and those who follow your trackers.
This enables them to know if they publish messages if they sign up to new accounts if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "with a small percentage of users in August" before the network was widely used on Monday, AFP stated a Twitter press secrecy by Carolin Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively rather confusing and as using rather ambiguous terms (RTs for a relapse of someone else's association, #followfriday for a recommendation to track other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, opens itself to a wider audience, presenting users something more close to popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation using tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, obsessive and overly reminiscent of Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrum.
Austria
Introducing a “золот rule” in the Constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in Austria decided on Tuesday to record the budget “solitary rule” in the Constitution to reduce the budgetary deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction by the rating agencies of Austrian public credit rating (3rd A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrat Werner Faymann has personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with the Austrian public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the top threshold of the 60 per cent rule established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of such countries as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's capacity to pay fell on only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by 3,000 million euros more than a year, we have brought the argument of the vice-canzler and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Christian Democrats Mikhael Schpindeleger.
Austria thus complied with the demand of the Euroson summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of State and Government demanded a reduction in budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through the Constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to accept the “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the federal State ' s State budget should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The objective is to make the State debt fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshichiko Noda
threatens new interventions in the currency market
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new exchange-market interventions if the value continued to grow.
We will intervene, as we have done last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda Senate explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to an historic mark that had led the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the Yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new record of force since 1945.
But since then, it has grown steadily, driven by investors' purchases, who perceive it as a “federation” in these dim times of economic collapse around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic plan of 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar had cost about 120 yen and Euros more than 160 yen.
The increase in Japanese currencies is detrimental to Japanese exports, as Japanese products are more expensive and reduce Japanese firms ' income from abroad when converting to national currency.
“Japan fights to rebuild itself” after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami, which devastated the Tohoku region (North-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill the fragile genius of recovery.
The third largest economic Power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter of -1.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, due to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic indicators”.
Dün Adzumi, Minister of Finance, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Council on Coinary Policy, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But the Deputy Governing Body, Hirohide Jamaguti, warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” to realize that no further mitigation should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the emitting organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000,000 million yen (519,000 million euros) to the ceilings it provides for various financial instruments to market securities.
Eurason
Growth rate, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of contamination by a debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise
While still concerned with the stability of the eurozone, the European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished the trauma at 3.064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.4%, and London fell 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties encountered in paying loans to the countries of Eurozone in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Dangered investors are just overly concerned about the risk of contamination," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the cargo of new doubts to the market for the ability of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has stabilized its view of Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized”, states Mitsusige Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
It is a return of concern about the future of the eurozone that hits one currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
Euro reached its bottom mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., European currencies cost $1.3570, falling by 0.4%.
According to the brokers, she fell after the consignment of the Chancellor, Angela Mercel HDS on Monday, at which a resolution was adopted, including the possibility for the country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone without leaving, however, the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates substantially above 6%
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
On Tuesday morning, Italian 10-year bond income reached 6.85 per cent and Spanish bond income reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of the participants.
The head of the future of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked at the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be his Government ' s “core task”.
Spain was attacked by markets before parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Between the interest rates of the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain reached a new historical maximum.
Expecting Eurason’s Growth
France recorded an economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3 per cent because of increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revisited the depreciation of the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And the economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent during the same period.
The first assessment for the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which no decision can be taken after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a reason for reflecting on the proportion and place occupied by nuclear energy.
The frustration will not bear fruit until all economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
France should base its views on objective facts and on rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will double the demand for electricity by 2050 unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue the production of electricity continuously, keeping in mind the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat the climate imbalance, a topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukusim accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most up-to-date reactors.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are few who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukusima to add one installation to its kit, resuming the construction of a station that had been interrupted after the accident at Tri-Mile Island.
While the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, the reality is contrary to that argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the leakage of carbon dioxide emissions for the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these adverse effects will be felt.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbin construction champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the same as the largest coal and gas consumer because of the pre-burst wind; the emissions of carbon dioxide and electricity prices by 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the average for Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the requirement for the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies are benefiting from the lowest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will increase the cost of electricity, making it illusory to declare the new industrialization of our country and to protect the purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay is more because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy made it possible to create an industry of 15,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirected.
It is highly export-oriented and attracts a whole set of specialized international trade for small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have to contribute to a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros per year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What eectric engineer will order an EPR designed to work for sixty years if it is planned to close its producer?
In order to solve the equation for energy, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilic sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by the Areva shows the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flemish.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, was under normal operating conditions, but without any impact on the human or the environment
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukusim, some people seem to forget that the accident was a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that caused tens of thousands of deaths.
The nuclear industry will learn from the accident, as learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to counter these phenomena.
As all energy specialists wishing to build a reactor are being considered, the stopping of its construction in Flamavil will be a great gift to the Competitions of Areva and EDF, clearing out the way for leadership to be conquered in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and prejudiced manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or an economic benefit?
Immigration policies in Nicolas Sarkozi have been criticized on various sides: overloading of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate to the figures policy and compatibility of this policy with France ' s self-proclaimed status as “the State of human rights”.
Then there was an administrative oppression of foreign students, which was posted when the Minister of the Interior (Libersion of 23 May) stated that France “was not in need of foreign talents, stoners and waitresses”.
But it is rarely analyzed economically.
The right and left parties in this regard agree largely.
On the right hand, Jacques Shirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed persons would not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers” and, on the left hand, Michel Rockar, who explained in 1990 that France “can not accept the poor from all over the world”.
Difference in generosity only
In 2005, the fear of intrusion into the country was felt by both the left and the right of the Polish water supply.
Both sides see the burden on the French economy and the French society in immigration.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they offer to immigrants.
In his programme, François Ollland confined itself to banalities, saying that “the joint work will solve our problem of immigration”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is costly economically.
As we are reminded by economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in a recent book that summarizes recent data on immigration (Special people: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among professionals on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that adopt immigrants.
Restriction on immigration has reduced growth and reduced employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the perception that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, provoking lower wages.
But experience has shown that in reality immigrants are much more complementary than the replacement of local labour by performing jobs that lack local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where education is not related to job offers.
Positive effects on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, complementarities between local and immigrants have a positive effect on local wages.
Jovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1 per cent of migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the middle of the American laureates of the Nobel Prize, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also making net gains in social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of European total budgets.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that immigrants who have arrived at the age of 30 years in Germany will, in their lifetime, bring net profits (negative income) to the State budget of an average Euro150,000.
Nicola Sarkozi, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to go to the missing points of growth.
The teeth mentioned used to intimidate immigrants had an equally opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it survived the tragedy of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulga and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonel in Greece.
Some felt that if democracy were to last on its enemies, it would be sufficient to set a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's time, "Malogo" knows that it's from the surface of the thinking.
The general vote, although binding on democracy, is not a sufficient prerequisite and can even be a “depressive tool”, as Etien Vurro, a philosopher-republican, once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organizations, divisions and controls of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but primarily the political crisis and the crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinodia of the True-Live Greek Referendum will have a double deficiency effect, showing both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its inability and inconsistency.
The duality needs to be pondered in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line for democracy has now shifted and, in the view of many, the Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong side.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as needed and chaoticly.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or leap with bound legs in the gap of nationalism, what a choice for a citizen!
No, we dream not of the guillotin's leaning, but of the implementation of, together, clear and continuous, choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many more of them will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis, a crisis in Europe.
The whole of Europe is subordinate to market dictatorships and rating agencies, suffering from weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is entirely humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, with each of its nations.
It is urgent that the European project be reinstated under popular sovereignty.
Because only joint Europeans can reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
An end to the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without causing us a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of the proposal by the socialists and Jacques Delora, all now demands the European economic Government.
Let's do it.
But imagining it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has led to the scourge is another insaneness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, the Republicans needed to be created.
Revolution would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe, an economically unified one.
This can be done only through the establishment of a more democratic Europe at the political level, the present people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Incontact chips are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpenta, Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11 per cent of world sales of micro-processors (bank cards, SIM-Cart phones), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6,000 million units.
The most important sector of uncontact technology, which allows public transport or purchases to be paid, simply by holding a map over the reader's device.
This year, 460 million uncontact chips will be sold in the world against 320 million earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world chip card market (6.925 million maps).
Europe, which has long left the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of endless payments.
Approximately 26 million bank cards of Visa have already been provided with this function and 75,000 terminals.
France starts with modest positions: 400,000 uncontact Visa maps are used.
But big shops are increasing pace.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontact Pass MasterCard.
To move faster, banks need to provide equipment to their clients.
“Two large organizations in France promised to systematically distribute bank maps for uncontact use to their clients in the future,” said Gerard Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe of France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of developing a future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
In the meantime, few machines are equipped with NFC technology (neighbourly field communication) necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must actually fly next year."
"We're counting on world sales between 80 and 120 million in 2012," explains Mark Berten, chapter Eurosmart.
But the banks go forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced an experiment in Kan from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhone clients and staff will be provided with uncontact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay on mobile phones.
Terrorist Front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians were now confident.
“The custodian who used the two organizations and the reports of the secret services showed that they were actively cooperating,” he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The kidnapping investigation of two French in Niger in January revealed two linkages.
The kidnapped people in the Niamey restaurant who were close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leoquar and Vensan Delori were apparently killed the following day, along with several of the kidnappers during a French special unit operation.
Among the debris left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several sim-cards belonging to terrorists.
Here's terror.
The analysis of the calls that had taken place pointed to several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who had long lived in Madiguri, northern Nigeria, Boko Haram Colibal, and the other, allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but there is no doubt to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect has received financial and real support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of death rows and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, now puts pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally considered this group as a community of educated people that is uninteresting.
Fast success
Based in 2002 in Maydiguri at Mosque, School and Imam-Fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram -- what west education means is sin -- preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It has been politicized and requires strict compliance with the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central Government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boco Haram activists showed special activity by committing numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuji's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the radicalized sect is going to go beyond its northern entrances.
Last Christmas she took responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in José, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on the strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia is of concern to all security experts today.
Today, when Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a interview with Presidents Gudlak Jonathan Alain Juppe warned of the danger of Boco Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
The world, as the Republican candidates see it
With respect to China, Iran and assistance to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, pursue a complex world with simple and more simplistic ideas?
If you heard the candidates for the Presidents from the Republicans, the voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the loud but deprived of details of foreign policy declarations, which are traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
The loopholes concerning China, Iran and Israel's assistance are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chances of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened Chinese to lodge a complaint to WTO and to accuse them of “manipulation of his currency is a sensitive topic for America, an aggravated by migration of whole industries to Asia.
Worse, if that leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama of China and the only candidate who is determined in complex foreign policies, was unable to overcome the emotion - stemming position.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who's kept at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he has announced."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to meet the promises to that partner.
An entrepreneur, Herman Kane, the second candidate rating, demonstrated a destructive misunderstanding.
He had recently called for the resistance of the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China had already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks to strike Iran in war, said that he was ready to use the United States army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture of suspects of terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and Michel Bahman as candidates.
It's all very far away from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, the weight of foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower the tone of fighting terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, in the premature withdrawal of “blame” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which gave him a reputation for a weak policy.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers the positive balance of national security with Obama, which has eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are linked to sand.
And claiming that America needs to be restructured economically to revive its leadership, Obama of rights.
North stream, new Russian gas entrance gates to Europe.
Gas pipeline, which connects western Europe and Russia directly to the Baltic Sea bottom, is launched.
It is designed to provide a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with the poppy.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on Baltic shores, between the orchestra and the excavated snacks, the opening of the North flow, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Mercel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion, and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutte, together returned the symbolic ventile, which monitors the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
In the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will go to Western Europe each year on the first pipeline of 1,224 kilometres, connecting the Leningrad area to the land of Meklenburg Memerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met the strong opposition of Poland and the Baltic States.
The Northern Pollution will indeed allow the gas to be transported directly to Germany, avoiding passage through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop before comparing North Pottok with the new Germano-Sowet Pact, implying an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means that the question is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, western Europe is seeking greater security for its supplies.
But at the price of Europe's deprivation of energy, because the project created the braking between east and western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has been able to reach its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves have already been reached.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, this is a new artery that binds us organically," asserted François Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All of this explains the broad smiles of the heads of the Gazproma, who were present in a large number in Lubmina, to the point of arrival of the gas.
Construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical exercise.
The underwater pipeline is made of a steel trapped in concrete to protect it from anchors of ships.
It's on the bottom of the seabed, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the minefields remaining since World War II had to be crossed.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as precautionary," said Jens Muller, the Spokesman of the North Pot.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel towers, without breaks throughout its length, without ventilations and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not delighted to see the Russian State company residing forever at its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we're going to shut down the gas flow in less than a minute," claims Jens Muller.
So in the case of leakage of gas in the gas pipeline, it will go into the air.
But this seems to be an unlikely designer who designed sewage designed only once every 100,000 years of age.
The state of the gas pipeline will be monitored by a submarine that pulls the ship, for external observation, and by a circular system inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-like apparatus shall be entered with a diameter of 1 meter in the pipeline and shall be pushed forward by the gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel, it provides accurate information about any metal deformation at 3 meters per second.
The gas pipeline was designed for 50 years without the need for the smallest repairs.
The gas shall be circulated only by pressure.
It's 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have combined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51 per cent of capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent each), Dutch Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9 per cent each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called the North Potock, which was charged with building and operating gas pipelines.
Its headquarters is located in Tsuga in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Subsequently, Gazprom leased the company for twenty years, with the possibility of extending the whole volume of gas transport.
"The Gasprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported," claims Jens Muller.
Finance for gas pipeline construction was provided by 30 per cent shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of the work would be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The GDF Suez investments will be around 240 million.
But the minoritarian shareholders are sure they'll pay for their costs because Gazprom takes on all the risks.
Gas pipeline leaves the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy shore planted by hill trees.
The ventiles of 4.5 metres of height form an outgoing gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before rolling it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour at full power and 6 million in 2012.
Brend notebook Moleskine
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return the taste to the writing.
He has the fragrance of adventures, the hours spent behind the letter in the light of a candle.
Moleskine's notebook is easy to find out on a rectangular black cover, on a rubber, on a yellow and white page, as if it were jammed over time.
However, the notebook Moleskine, the one we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, in Milan, decided to launch design notes.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by old production techniques, a hammer - laminated cotton tissues used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine brought into line the old and forgotten thing that was a cult for the Vanguard artists until the twentieth century," said Maria Sebregondi, who had since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We went far away from the production of the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italy's borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting the profile of a typical buyer is hard because the notebook is equally attracted by businessmen, a student and a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, widely viewed and educated.
The small Italian company, which first had only 12 staff members, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks to Fnac bookshops, shops in small towns centers, and has been able to gain wide awareness.
"We've followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter despite the appearance of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, a brand organized a “Great Way” exhibition where architects and artists demonstrated their own notes.
In August, he also set up covers with a leopard picture on the occasion of a movie festival in Locarno.
Using his successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has made a variety of products that now include bags, pens, and computer bags. Brand includes all types of support.
Success that generated envy: Modo Modo was purchased in the autumn of 2006 by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now Syntegra Capital, which put a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, 19 per cent as against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Is it quenching?
"No, - stresses Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities."
“In 15 years, significant progress has been made.”
"The percentage of unemployed was not 2 at the time, but 3 times more."
"Once there's a lot of work to do."
It must be said that there are still many impediments to employment for the disabled.
Among them, more than the elderly: 37 per cent are over 50 (17 per cent on the average).
They are more likely to have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor degree, and of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, against the average of 38 per cent.
In short, all these are the criteria that make return to work very difficult and which constitute the essence of the problem”, according to Christian Grapen, Director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies to hire disabled workers.
These are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about the mentality that is changing, but too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre, commissioned by Cité, showed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “represented persons in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally inappropriate”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of having 6 per cent of the disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures for 2008 represent 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blan, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “consolidated” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, fell from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros) in 2007-2011.
"The 2005 Act that raised the tax created strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blan."
“But this improvement also reflects increased consciousness, in particular in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of employees aged 20 to 49 have workers with disabilities, compared with 82 per cent of workers from 100 to 199.
Azar: "How happy."
Before fighting the Blue evening on Tuesday (20.45) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We're not going to get to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months later, the Belgian coacher can only commend his attacker in the match against Turkey.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go on," she assures the Lille player.
As long as his achievements in the club are contrasted, it's one whole thing, he's justified.
"I'm in Lill, I'm a year round, and Belgium doesn't."
"I have to make glasses."
Restrained, in front of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Denny to finally blaspheme.
Remembering, however, the notion of “satisfaction”.
He has supported the Blues since the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 victorious campaigns.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also exacerbates the special nature of this match.
And especially that which is on the other side of Mother, Johann and Adil, he recalls.
"Just our roads crossed."
"The opportunity to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens remembered good-naturedly.
"Hordity" plays a "monster match."
"Hordity" also asserts as "neighbourly" that France "really became a very high-level team" only one year after the injury in Nairobi.
"Loran Blan was like a thunderstorm, he admired.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technician athlete will fly in one plane with the direction of the blue... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure this is in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very self-confident
Portugal, Paulo Bentu, begins its response match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On his way to him, both teams seemed to lose a sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Bentu already sees himself in Poland and in Ukraine.
There is no doubt to him that the Assembly, with its steering power since September 2010, has been identified as Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia to win.
Taking into account 0-0 on Friday in hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match more than an hour, it was unable to achieve the willful goal to calm it down.
"It's a good result, however, which has a certain risk."
But in their luminously illuminated Stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass in the eyes of the public, which should be delighted, even though the match will be very tense,” said the optimistic but reasonable Benta.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chances of being on Euro 2012," said successor Carlos Kayros.
Night on Friday in the match against Bosnia demands a victory from the Portuguese.
Nobody could have built the Bosnians.
"It's a good result in which there's, however, some risk, - regrets Benta.
"We're going to play against a team with a lot of technology and players with a lot of personal dignity," he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on Bosnians from the outset, not to give them time to think.
That's a good idea, if only this time it was realistic.
