From my point of view, the literature programme was formed by the ladies of the Balzakov age on the basis of their interests.
From Russian literature in the 19th century, we preferred Danilsky and Volconsky.
They wrote blethristics, of course, from the point of view of the most balsakov-aged ladies.
And the psychology and the torment of Tolstoy's hero and Turgenev's hero is not that interesting to teenagers.
Adolescents are rarely interested in heroe psychology.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Matrace Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
Micronestic Prestige model: comfortability and natural composition.
The mattress has different tightness of the sides: the medium-strong surface is made up of laxed coconut fibers and natural latex, moderately soft, a stove of natural latex.
The spring block from 1,000 springs per square metre is fast adapted to the sleeping body to prevent the effect of “wave” or“ hamaka”.
Driving materials should be identified among the merits of the model.
The velocity perforated for airproofness is well vented naturally, like the coconut coconut coyre.
As a result, a healthy microclima of the bedroom is maintained.
Matros are also subject to an extended guarantee period.
The period of official guarantee from the producer is five years, and the period of operation of the mattress is higher.
The protection against dust and pollution is placed on the removable cheul from the jaccard in the kit.
Acquire the orthopaedic cushion coupled with the mattress, recommended to maintain the optimal position of the spine during the sleep.
The filler determines the appointment of the sides — the coconut serves as anatomic support for the back, the latex relaxs the muscles.

Germany: The fourth vaccination from the cronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
The expert believes that the current vaccination in Germany will not become final but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active privatization campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine would likely be sufficient for full protection.
The director of the Association of Doctors of General Practice, Ulrich Wygeldt, is convinced of this.
Die Welt reports on Saturday, December 11, about this.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” the expert believes.
In addition, Wygeldt hopes that the fourth vaccination from the coronavirus can be carried out “combined with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new strain of the Omicrone Crown.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
So the probability of reinfecting Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is illustrated by a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, BioNTech/Pfizers are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that two doses of vaccine doses do not provide sufficient protection against infection by the new version of Omicrone Crown.
A study of BioNTech and Pfizer revealed that in two doses, vaccine effectiveness is significantly lower: “neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that the two doses of BNT162b2 doses do not provide sufficient protection against omecrone-stalm infection”, stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
A third dose is therefore needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates a reduction between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the Delta Virus and the Omicronesian Crowvirus.
“Israel's experience is very convincing,” the expert stressed.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib is a special branch of Bet-A's family from Pontoon21®.
It (as the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the many other vibes, since it was originally designed to be used for idle fishermen, not just for fishing.
These vibes are larger than those of close-minded analogies, a measure of weight, which undoubtedly has a positive impact on the nuance of these interesting baits.
Another identified feature is the upper slippery of a strong and volatile plastic, which creates additional vibrations at vertical and horizontal wires.
As a winter vibe, the bet-A-Vib catches a pretty aggressive game.
Often the most catchable is the simple monotonal animation, that is, the movement of the detacher up and down almost without the pause.
When planning a vertical axle deviation, it is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited area overlapping by underwater vegetation, cortex and other obstacles for which the trailer is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant in the winter fishing of a vessel and a large window, especially in the middle of winter, when a fine and aggressive bait is required.
Bet-A-Vib reaches the extreme point of the trajectory, immediately turns around and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successful in the winter catching of the pond trout.
You can choose from two modifications to please it: a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib is capable of dividing a passive cheek that does not even respond to a liver.
The fishing of Bet-A-Vib shows the distance and accuracy.
It is understandable and not caprizen, well combined with the leaf and woven cords of even large diameter.
For the fishing of the cheek, vessel, erche or glass, except equally relevant, and “intern”, sometimes with the “chirkany” at the bottom.
If you're catching in a secured place, you can change the front troin to a double, which would reduce the probability of ceilings.
Among the bait of its class Bet-A-Vib is one of the most sustainable in the workplace and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, both relatively small and relatively deep sites can be used.
All models are equipped with gutters Owner ST-36.

In Libya 7,000 Russian mercenaries
In Libya there are over 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner (PWC).
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Haled al-Mishri.
“Now there are over 7,000 PMC mercenaries of Wagner in Libya.
They also have aircraft.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Cupra.
They have 30 jet aircraft on the Gadabia airplane (also used as the civilian airport in Sirte), " he cites the Anadolu agency.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries “will try to capture” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “there will lead their people to power” in the Central African Republic.
Save Presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow sought the country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “departed in Libya”.
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the Jufra airbase, notes the Agency's publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else the mercenaries can be
According to the agency, Wagner is expected to operate in nine African countries - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences on the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as on the supply of weapons, technology and military services to those countries,” said the article.
According to the media, the Guards allegedly fought in Donbassa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not meant by the police or the registry of the jury, and its fighters are not listed in the language lists of the personnel.
This company is subject to U.S. sanctions.
Recall that earlier, 27 EU countries had approved the Vagner Results.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament, with advisory functions with dominant Islamists, writes the TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of Parliament and Head of State from 24 December at least to February 2022.
“Before the elections remain fewer than two weeks, and the chances that they will pass in time are steadily reduced,” the material states.
On this occasion, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed the promulgation of a final list of candidates for an indefinite period, transmits a telecanal of Sky News Arabia.
External policy in the eyes of the Russians
38 per cent of Russians see more success in their foreign policies than failures, 29 per cent believe that failures prevail.
"According successes - in Syria, protected, restored the world there, the decision on "North Flow-2", "the whole world was scared that cool armaments," "We've waited."
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, says the study of the Foundation “Public opinion”.
The Government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all the public services have also become digital
The Government of Dubai reported a complete renunciation of paperwork and the transition to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the Emirate Information Agency WAM.
“Today, the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of the life of Dubai -- we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government -- stated on Saturday the second Prince of Emirate, the President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan Ben Mohammed Ben Rashid Al Mctoum.
Internal and external documentation in all Dubai State institutions will now be implemented only in digital form through special information platforms.
The introduction of the new sector has affected everything without exception: health, MCH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc., many commercial structures have also joined the Government initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of documents started in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, the authorities have estimated that 336 million paper sheets have been saved, representing 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million in cash equivalents.
Previously, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

The production and export of Turkish cars fell below the 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish cars declined dramatically in November against the background of lira depreciation.
As a result, the 11-month performance of industry was worse than last year, reports Bloomberg, referring to data from the Turkish Road Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 vehicles were released in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
About 75,9,000 cars were shipped to export, more than 25 per cent falling last year.
And if, following the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish road sector showed a positive momentum by the past year, the production of cars by 11 months of 2021 was 0.3 per cent worse than last year.
The result was a sharp decline in the Turkish lira, which in November had a 29 per cent increase in the dollar.
This has led to the fall of economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 IUF entities received deferral of credit payments in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov described the situation of grants for small and medium-sized businesses, transmitting a correspondent to MIA “Kazinform”.
“On the information of the Agency for Financial Market Management and Development, this year, pursuant to the Director of State's instructions of 1 April 2021, the President of the Agency issued order No. 127 of 9 April 2021 entitled “On approval of the arrangement for deferral of loans of small and medium-sized business entities”, Alihan Smail wrote in his response to the request for delegates.
He recalled that the arrangements for deferring loan payments were for banks and microfinance organizations to defer credit payments issued to IAS entities, including IUU, until 1 April 2021, from 1 April to 30 June 2021.
The term of deferral was 30 to 90 days for the selection of the IUF entity.
The borrower ' s statement could indicate a different deferral period.
During the deferred period, claims for work had been suspended, notice of the need to pay outstanding arrears, as well as the creditor ' s levy on commissions and other payments,” noted the applicant.
In 2021, the second-level banks received applications for deferral of 603 IAS borrowers, of which 553 IAS entities were deferred to 9.7 billion tenge.
In IFO, 131 IUF entities have submitted applications for deferral, of which 95 subjects with a value of 105.8 million tenge,” concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the "ocmiron strain"
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity can carry it easier than those with a strong protective response
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmiron" might be dangerous.
The reason for this is to be found in the condition of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “ocmiron” has originated in the body of HIV-positive or immunodeficiency.
I mean, in mutation, he had no resistance to immunity.
That's why he's more aggressive.
With no immunity response, he became very quick.
Apparently, there are those spikes of proteins, schips, maybe more than they have been laid, their antibodies have not been cut during the mutation, and he comments to the pulmonary scientist Sergei Purassev.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity could carry the “ocmiron” easier than those who have a strong protective response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's what happens in pneumococcus infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds are cheeeeky.
The immune response of a young man is not adequate; wherever he could only threaten his finger, he beats like a gun on the throats, and He has concluded:
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus had dangerous side events and the most unpleasant of them was pneumonia.
Bacterial and viral sprays can be found in the lungs.
If the first treatment is very successful and fast, in the second case, only symptoms can be purchased -- all the hope of the body.
The first sign of the developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the intoxication of the organism is temperature, weakness, weakness.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: hard breathing, top in the throat, cough.
Abdominal pains on the right or on the left can also indicate a growing problem.
In the meantime, in Russia, a vaccinating generation between 12 and 18 years of age may begin until the end of the year.
Virusologist, director of the IFTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory, Paul Volčkov pointed out that this category is very severely affected by the claw.
Adolescents who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
It's the most socially active protein, like the nurses in the kindergartens, said "Mosque 24," Paul Wolčkov, the virusologist, the director of the MFTI genomic engineering laboratory.
I'm very grateful to the author for this article.

Immunologists have made a hypothesis of why people with obesity are victims of coffin
The authors studied the fat cloth left behind the barial operation and found that fat cells known as Adipocytes could be infected with crownvirus.
Immune cells located in grim tissue have also become infected with macrophaes and have shown a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists have also studied the fats of the patients who died of the codied, and they have discovered the coronavirus particles in fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, to avoid immune response.
It's probably capable of SARS-CoV-2.
A biologist described the reasons for dementia.
The biological science candidate, Simeon Goloshakien, described the reasons for dementia and described how to prevent it in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is shown by the progressive loss of cognitive functions - in time, the person is hardly guided even in a familiar environment.
Goloshakien noted that dementations tend to cause neurogenegenic disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a shortage of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertonia, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activities can be played,” he said.
Dementation is also affected by harmful habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep abuse and low-carbon lifestyles.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the indifference, the inability to concentrate and the decline in abstract thinking.
“The debate is that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the factors at risk,” adds a biologist.
To prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends that the necessary loading level be maintained, cognitive skills and skills required by memory and logic.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, at the television station Al-Hayat, the chief inspector of the Department of Returns of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ancient Egyptians, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, the Bible Museum in Washington discovered 5,300 monuments of ancient Egypt's civilization," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all smuggled artifacts were registered in the archives.
The departmental staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “were tracking auctions worldwide and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector said that upon the return, cultural values had been restored and then remanded in museums.
He said that one of the returned artifacts was the ancient human skeleton in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find a leaflet of Pharaoh Tutanghamon, auctioned in London.
The Auction House of Christie's held trades on 4 July, where the luster was sold for over 3,000 years for 5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This caused resentment on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that art was illegally removed from the Karak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanghamon, depicted in the image of the sun god Amon, has been kept in a private collection and has not been present for trade since 1985.
How the relics got into Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking repatriation of illegally shipped monuments in recent years.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled ancients are the result of archaeological research of black miners.
“No criminal Tatars are taken into account” — and this is right, since the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a people (abandoned to Turks).
If you would like to add, only 42,000 people will live in the Crimea.
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turk language group unit unites them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices for staff
Credit Suisse demands that his staff provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, writes Financial Times.
The case is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss Bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount for the acquisition of a mobile phone or a smartphone from a telecommunication operator partner.
Under existing rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank enjoys the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet with a client who was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to remote jobs, the bank wishes to extend this rule to all the devices that have been used to deal with working matters.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline for staff to consult the new rule.
The information on the new requirement is not officially commented on in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in creativity, but hardest for the earthly life of the poet and his ego.
He's already out of any literary associations, he's spilled up with majesticism, he's himself, but he's known, he's demanded, sometimes he's aggravated by critics, even angry, but the reader's ready to carry it on his hands.
Over a year, more than 60 poems have been written, many of them are real masterpieces, the Persidian motivation cycle completed, the poem Anna Sneguin, published 8 books, the “Russ Soviets” compendium.
And the main success was that, at the end of June 25, the Lord concluded with Esenin a treaty to issue his essays in the 3rd volumes.
None of Sergei's modern Alexandrovic poetry has received such honor, he's the first!
In addition, it made very good money — the fees amounted to 1,000 roubles a month for 20 months (a factory director, for example, received 300 roubles a month, an engineer 200).
The funds that year were needed more than ever.
Esenin married the granddaughter Lev Tolstoy Sophie Tolsta, and he had to arrange for family life, support for Kathu and Sasha sisters, as well as for his mother.
It's like life would have been happy, but it's mostly painted in the dark tone, as if it were materializing a nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the Wind Whistling?
Over the empty and desolate fields,
It's like slurry in September,
Alcohol swells in the brain.
Many acquaintances pointed out that Essene was severely down, ill, obviously ill.
Increasingly, riots, nerve breakdowns are being repeated.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Alexandrovic is someone who has been treated, no reliable documents are left.
For example, in May 1923, when Esenin was the fourth wife, Americans of Icedora Duncan corrected her health at the Paris clinic at Professor Peter Hannushin (now Essein will fall two years later in Moscow).
Here are evidences of poetry, scandals on this ground, of militia seizures that have been spilled by dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20th terrible poet's novel with green snakes has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Startz.
Surprisingly, though, Esenin never had his own home in Moscow or in Peter, found himself in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old people remember:
“It was only during the night, and in most cases, in an uninhabitable, drunken state.
One day, when Esenin came back at 4:00 in the morning, he fell on the stairwell...
Sleeping, scratching his face and whispering.
When he came a little bit into himself, he began to cough, spraying the whole sheet with blood..."
Esenin himself, after the warrior in Europe and the United States (in the United States, there was a dry law, but Duncan took on a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I haven't seen anything there except the cabs and the streets...
I'm at the end of my life and I've stopped memorizing people...
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I was drinking 'cause I'm bored."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is the modern implementation of the budget model in the Prize Line.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs of Duet.
Inside the large spring, a softer spring of small size is inserted.
This allows the uniform distribution of the load on the mattress.
On two sides, the mattress is supplemented by an artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and volatility of this material increases the comfortable effect of the mattress.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms” against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Yablonski, expressed the view that President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
The relevant statement was made in the interview of the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonski, the sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “resolved Lukashenko”, but he is“ actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to site kp.ru, the European Union had previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, it was stated that it was willing to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on the Silk hat" when the oak jacket makes the man a smile.
The 2021 secular events dominated obscurity jackets.

“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union are united in our condemnation of the build-up of Russia's military power and the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” says the statement.

“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in Normand to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the “Big Seventh”.

Pfizer vaccination found to be 32 times less efficient than microne-stalm
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech versus omicron-stal coronavirus is 32 times lower compared with the rest of the disease.
Scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong concluded this way, transmitting South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccin was considered less effective on the basis of a study of anti-viral activity among citizens who received two doses of a drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people have a high level of anti-viral activity against the original version of Sars-CoV-2, but this capacity has been significantly reduced against omicron varieties," said Professor Malik Peyris.
However, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the heavy flow of the disease in the form of coronavirus infection.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account its impact on the omicronest.
The authors of the study concluded that omicronesm could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increased mortality unless additional measures were taken.
Ukrainian Head of Defense accused the FRF of blocking the supply of NATO weapons in Kiev
The Head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of the former Chancellor of FRG, Angela Mercel, in blocking the acquisition of Kyev of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview of the Financial Times, on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that Germany had placed a veto last month on the purchase of Ukrainian anti-cyper systems and rifles for the defeat of pilots.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened his position on rifles and recognized them as non-death weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
However, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Previously on Sunday, Ambassador Andrew Melnik of Ukraine in Germany, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to deliver arms to Cholz Chancellor.
He said that the previous leadership of the FWG had explained its refusal to place arms at the risk of the military escalation of the conflict in Donbassa, despite the “occupation by Russia” of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same “unлогical” position, I am sure, will be preserved by Germany with the new Chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader, Vladimir Greensky, said that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in the equipment of the Navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be a technical partner for Ukraine”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the Co-Chair of the Green Party of FRF, Robert Habek, visited the Republic, where he spoke for the sale of the defence weapons of Kiev.

Discovered ways of recovering stolen money through the Internet
There are several ways to get the money stolen through the Internet and not to be a victim of fraud in the future.
They were opened by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when the banking card is received, it is recommended that the main funds be kept on the map or bank account that are not used in online screening.
Part of the savings can be deferred to the savings account and withdrawn as necessary.
Experts also recommend establishing a separate map for online purchases.
If money was stolen at shops that did not use 3D Secure protection technology, the refund procedure could be launched.
“In the rules established by payment systems, unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, the participant shall be liable in the computation chain which does not use the service”, the representative of the Communications Bank said.
The expert from the international payment provider, Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a map on online resources that did not require two-factor authorization, the transaction could be challenged and returned.
It is noted that, in some cases, the Internet stores themselves return their funds to the client if the order has not yet been sent to the delivery.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the League of Secure Internet, Yakaterin Mizulin, reported that only in 2021, 11,000 cases of fraud had been received, ranging from the sale of forged documents to theft of personal data.
She said that the establishment of a single window for complaints against online fraud could be an effective solution under current circumstances.
The Sholz arrived in Poland to discuss “North Flow-2” and EU legislation
The newly elected German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants at the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with Russian gas pipeline “North Flow-2”.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of two countries expressed unequivocal expectations.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Matheuss Moravetski, stated that he would call on Scholz to take action against the “North Flow-2”, where Russian gas is expected to be transported to Germany by way of Ukraine.
According to Moravitzky, Russia can use gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported the efforts of Poland to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court has fined Poland by acknowledging that the legal reforms carried out by the right party “Right and Justice” violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay a fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation had priority over EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which swore on the Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make public commitments to stop the North Flow-2 work in the case of Russia ' s invasion of Ukraine.
American officials stated to the Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany on the stopping of gas pipeline, if Russia invaded Ukraine, reported on Tuesday to a high-ranking officer in the United States Congress.
The German officials did not confirm these communications, but Scholz, on Wednesday, warned of the consequences of Russia violating the border of Ukraine, and that position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the “Bigger Seven.”

The money found in the church of the sanctionary will pay $20,000.
The santechnic who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will pay the reward.
This is reported in the press release of a non-profit crime organization of Houston.

"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you've done and what you can do," quotes KPRC-TV.
The discovery appears to be linked to theft that took place in the Leikwood Church seven years ago.

Money was insured, so the church did not lose.
However, the prize amounting to $25,000 was announced for information on the criminals.
Justin Coley could not claim for that amount, since the award had already expired.

He'll get $20,000.
Previously, it was reported that the police had questioned pastor Joel Ostin about the money found in Leikwood Church.

“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist channel for new-year, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other activities, which involve an increase in the turpotic,” noted Barros.
Previously, the Brazilian authorities obliged non-crowded tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Opened full protection scheme from COVID-19
Virusologist, doctor of medical science, a professor of Russian science, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, opened a scheme for full protection against coronavirus infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
There is no injecting injecting a large amount of immunoglobulin A.
Immunoglobulins A protect the sliced shell, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And in the midst of the vaccination, we have most of the immunoglobulins G (antiele).
And if you enter both vaccines, you'll get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no double vaccination decision yet," he said.
Sergei Tokarev, the principal preventative doctor of UrFO, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injecting was the possibility of stopping being a COVID-19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the organism is expected to be the maximum.
David Melik-Husseinov, Minister of Health of the Beginning Area, stated earlier that the new COVID-19 pandemic would lead to a new crown-virus infection among children.
He said that this is the case in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic came before.
Inna, um...
I've been talking to a cobel for a long time. If you're ready to swap a warm house, a carpet, a favor, a love and a bitch play, you go ahead.

I had a lot of hosts to stop running after a dog, although they said they'd run out of it, 200,000 run away, just picking up and driving in the other direction.
In the end, "200,000" chose a master, not a dog who ran somewhere.
Bullying protests against vaccination opposers continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators entered the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction over restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make vaccination from the ovarian compulsory.
Since February the next year, the untreated people will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
The Spanish, indignant by the health policy of the authorities, conducted a peace march in Madrid.
Some were holding posters with the label "This is a false pandemic," "I'm not going to vaccinate."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is obligated to access bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, houses of the elderly and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to establish sanitary passports by the authorities in a number of regions of the country was against an increase in the number of crown-virus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestants protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The act began peacefully, but then became a clash with the security forces of the order.
The group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
Law enforcement officials responded by applying watermets.

WHO has discovered “omikoron” in six dozen States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new coronavirus strain “omicrone” has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The spread of the strain was described in the WHO report.
As of 9 December, the organization has already identified strains in 63 countries, all six WHO regions.
This has only become an active circulation since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the high rate in which a new version of the coronavirus is disseminated.
WHO experts are concerned that the new preliminary data strain can be circulated by the spread of the “delta” strains, but it is the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolute countries without exception.
Tedros Adhan Gebreyes, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said that the omicronest is able to have a significant impact on the crownvirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that “omekron” will replace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of survivors in Britain alone will be about 1 million, and this is the fact that a number of hundreds of people in the Kingdom are officially known to be omicrons, and it is estimated to be 10,000.
Britain's experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and over 2,000 people will be transported to hospitals at the peak every day.
What the British health system will not be able to do.
The situation is compounded by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfeder-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The reaction to the “omekron” of Russian Satellite V is not yet known -- it will be understood in the next few weeks.
The Gamalei Center has just begun to test a Russian vaccine on the "omicron strain."

Russiaan warned of a new scheme of frauds
The evildoers began looking for new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
It's written by "Ivvestia" with a reference to experts.
According to Ivideon Zauura Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is the diplhey.
In this case, fraudulents create a fairy video based on actual records involving the victim.
This enables neurosseti to reproduce precisely the characteristics of a person's conduct.
Abutalimov added that using a diplheyer, abusers can call acquaintances on video contacts or create a video clip with a copy of the person for blackmailing.
“Such forgeries can easily provoke bulling, because a fictitious malicious person can place people in stupid, dangerous or compromising pseudo scenarios,” said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetcol, in turn, pointed out that psychological people trust more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.

Five actions to avoid diabetes of sugar are listed
Problems with blood sugar levels are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach much importance to this, and it is for good.
In time, sugar diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive activities play a key role in preventing disease generation.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of diverse drinks and passing on regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products increase blood sugar to a dangerous rate when used in excess.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The effects of the disease are not only malnutrition but also habits.
To reduce the risks of sugar diabetes, there is a lot to move.
Experts recommend that low-carbon diet be maintained.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight but also protect against sharp fluctuations in the level of sugar.
Many cells must be eaten to protect against diabetes.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus contribute to a sense of well - being, digestive juice, and more mealing.

Dr. Paulova told me about the "migrans of the weekend" in the laborologists.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in the sense of weekends
The reason for the deterioration of self-employment after working days is often the “end-day migraine”, a well-known medical doctor, a candidate for medical sciences, a senior scientist at the Faculty of Basic Medicine, a scientific leader of the Zuchr Paul's System Medicine Clinic in his telegram channel.
She said that it is particularly common for workforce who suffer headaches, breakdowns, and weaknesses on weekends.
In addition to a week’s accumulated fatigue, Dr.
On weekends, our lives are changing dramatically.
"Sleep for a long time, all day lying on the couch, probably eating more, and drinking less, the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and water shortages, it is heavy and broken.”
A later recovery is a complementary role.
For example, if you get up three hours later, there will be a reaction called the jetlag.
It comes from travelers who cross several time belts.
To determine which of the factors is crucial to deteriorating self - feeling, Paul recommended that the most change on weekends be monitored.

Scientists in South Africa stated that Pfizer's vaccine was poorly effective against “omicrone”
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine was not effective.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported a low efficiency of Pfizer vaccine against coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of neutralization of the omicron) corresponds to (the level) of vaccine effectiveness of 22.5 per cent against symptom infections, which... raises doubts on the vaccine ' s ability to protect against infection, says the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
At the same time, experts clarified that a drug could save from a severe disease.
Previously, at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was projected that the omicron-store of crownvirus could cause a new wave of pandemic with more frequent hospitalization in Britain than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in conventional products?
The sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to type two diabetes, as well as to cardiovascular and hecological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that a hidden sugar - ingredient similar to the calorie, composition and glyque indices may be identified by an unknown word in the product.
Several tens of names, in fact, representing sugar, can be presented on the label.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fruit.
Other raw sugars, such as dextrosis (sugar derived from maize), leurosis (fruct sugar), melassa (black patoca), cirop agava, etc.
These are all simple carbons that belong to mono- and dyssaharids, and they can be not only in conduit products, but also in ketchup, in doctoral colbas, bread, etc.
According to Roskatche, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and rough products, as well as to draw attention to the label and many different sugar names.
Different types of sugar are different in taste, but no matter what is called the ingredient of a product, syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white, it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the number of sugar specified by the producer in the package but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc., initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for the FRY 25 years later
The new Chancellor of FRG Olaf Scholz stated that the import of gas was losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonization of the economy.
He said that by 2045 Germany was planning to completely abandon gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, 25 years later, the world will be so that the question of the transport of gas to the FWG and Europe will play a different role," said the Chancellor.
Scholz noted that Germany remained committed to Ukraine ' s transport of Russian natural gas in the future, as it was now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement that recorded support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Previously, Germany's head, Annalena Berbok, stated that the gas pipeline certification process, “North-2 flow”, was ongoing.
According to the Minister, the Coalition Negotiations and the discussion of the Coalition Treaty had stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The Diploma also indicated that the pipeline was not yet “conforming to the requirements” of the European Union.

Hackers hacked Twitter of the Prime Minister of India
The hackers hacked the Twitter acquaintance of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.
The evildoers have been able to publish a fairy message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized the Bitcoin as a legitimate payment fund and that the country had already purchased the criterion.
Modi's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The representatives of the Prime Minister said that Twitter was quick to respond, and access to the account was restored.
The page of India’s Prime Minister was already broken in 2020 and called for contributions to the fund through cryptization.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on 12 December ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, noon, the majority of New Caledonia's inhabitants voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in the third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two ballots.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, New Caledonia ' s independence was 3.51 per cent (2,755) voted, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted “on the contrary”.
Apparently 43.90%, more than 80,000 New Caledonia residents participated in the elections.
As the interim results of the France-Presse Agency commented, “the outcome of these elections did not leave any room for doubt”, as the independence advocates called on the voters not to vote.
As initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelagy impeded a full and fair pre-election campaign.
This non-participation thus opened the way for the third victory of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and 2020 to 53.3 per cent.
As the separatists have stated, they do not recognize the last ballot and challenge it to the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, in the palace of Elise, President of France, Emmanuel McRon, is expected to follow the referendum.
The topic of the independence of New Caledonia has greatly revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several candidates to the Presidents expressed their support for the Territory to remain in France, as it was “the last region of the European Union presence in the Pacific Ocean”.
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” repeated Eric Zemmur on a number of occasions.
The same statement was made by the candidate for the Republicans of Valerie Peques, who, at the end of October, published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel McRon announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position “because it is not his responsibility”.
However, the President added, “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France”.

Readers WSJ criticized the article on Russia and the United States relations
The Wall Street Journal criticized the article of Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West allegedly sacrificed Ukraine to Russia.

At the end of Hartwell, western countries called for “to take a single front against Russia”.
The readers of WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article, there's quite a lot of false information," quotes the News RIA, commenting one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it," and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," said another.

The earthquake of the magnetud 5.2 occurred in the Kuril Islands region
The earthquake of the magnetud 5.2 occurred next to the Shikotan Kuiling Island.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 kilometres north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The fire was depths of 92.5 kilometres.
Previously, seismologists recorded the earthquake by a 7.5 magnetud in Peru, where ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start producing new-generation reactive drones.
The new Turkish-Ukraine plant will begin the creation of ANKA type-of-air unmanned jet aircraft (BPLA).
On 11 December, an outside adviser to the head of the office of President Alexei Arestović of Ukraine reported on this.
That is, they are capable of acting against air objects, against other unmanned aircraft.
Even against the airline.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish airline: the corpus and the like," quotes his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANCA, Arestović said that it was jet, not corrugated BPLAs.
He said it was a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeded it "by all the characteristics."
The first BPOLA Party shall be produced by the factory at the end of the next year, and Aristović has been concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the pilot has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The Ukrainian General headquarters had previously secreted data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin missiles during military operations in Donbassa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greensky, reported that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military manoeuvres had begun in the country.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, the Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian mine defences entered into an agreement on the construction of a centre in the Kiev area to train staff, as well as the testing and maintenance of Turkish Bayraktar BPLA.
The office of the Ukrainian leader's press service called this memorandum “a big, real step forward.”
Two lions escaped from the airport.
At Singapore Airport, the lions escaped.
This is reported in The Straits Times.
Two predators were able to get out of a container with seven lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown, from which countries they were brought to Singapore and where they were sent.
One of the runaway lions ran away on the roof of the container.
The wild beasts couldn't get away from him because of a close-up net.
Opposition ended after arriving at Mandai Wildlife Group, with all Singapore zoos.
They have razed lions through wires with a tranquilizer and plan to bring them to a quarantine.
Previously, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion had escaped from his master and had walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people did not suffer.
Specialists warned of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that surplus of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the Daily Express.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not suffer from folic acid shortages are less at risk of some cancers, such as colors.
However, surpassing the necessary dose in contrast contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin recommends that the number of folic acids consumed during the day be monitored.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer is only increased if it is substantially rejected in a large or smaller way.
Kitzyn recommends that no vitamin B9 be accepted in pills without a doctor ' s recommendation, that it be sure to monitor the mining and avoid milk cotton and other foods that contain folic acid.
Previously, Rachel Fayne, a nutrition consultant, referred to flue acid as a substance that slows ageing.
As it is, inter alia, in avocado, Fain recommended that men, after 50 years of age, eat this fruit more frequently.
In the United Kingdom, about 75,000 people may die by April because of omicrons.
Britannica scientists predict that the omicron-stale coronavirus could die up to 75,000 in England in the next five months unless the winter restrictive measures were tightened.
This was reported in The Guardian, referring to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
According to the most optimistic projection of experts who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25,000 deaths are reported in the country because of the omicron strain, with approximately 175,000 patients being hospitalized.
At the peak of the hospital's morbidity, more than 2,000 patients will receive every day.
“Severe measures to combat the coronavirus may be necessary to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if the omicronesms are more contagious than the delta option and the existing vaccines cannot be removed”, said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Security Agency has previously informed that, if the omecrone rate continues at the current level, about 1 million infections will be detected by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, omicrone can become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 cases of omicron-stale cronavirus have been detected in Britain, of which 633 have been identified over the last days.
At the same time, on 9 December, the head of the British Minsdrava, Sajid Javid, indicated that the figure could actually be 10,000.

The world's demand for super-hop grew by a quarter.
Construction of superhite this year and orders for the next year are all recordings in the world, despite calls for a reduction of hydrocarbon footprints and the fight against climate change.
In the world ship registry, the number of boats ordered was 1,200 units, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas reduction, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have a desire and money to a 50 million pounds and above will not diminish, says Guardian.
However, they are growing.
This year 25 per cent of the vessels were ordered more than in the previous year.
Brokers say it wasn't 20 years old on the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second reason is also for the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners personally, now the absolute majority of them are working away and negotiations are conducted on a zombie basis.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that the shipyards are taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more, only their yacht would be ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and super-poor people could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the behavior of the rich and call it decadetic.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, of yacht, or of flights on their own airplanes, the elites are frustrating in society because they do not want to share responsibility for climate change with all other humankind.
Economists call upon Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for super-poor taxes, although they realize that such money mobility will be extremely difficult to implement.
In the meantime, only the number of super-Acht orders, but also their characteristics, is impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of food higher than 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Rackie builds a REV Ocean boat 183 meters long.
After going down to the water, it'll be the largest yacht in the world.
The boat includes a “Lonband”, as well as a submarine designed to study the depths of the sea.
On existing super-eachtas, theaters of helicopters, theaters under the open sky, and on some of them, such as the McGregor's Yachte, are a platform for unity.According to the American University of India, Richard Wilk said that, compared to the total number of greenhouse gas samples, carbon footprints produced by super-govert.
But it's symbolic, given that the multimillionaires in the world are a little over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the use of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the thousands of times more than the average of the planet’s average population is the episode of billionaires.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant of the planet, Roman Abrahamovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the embedded foot were hiding on his Eclipse yacht in length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on board a boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and let the command evacuate the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superechite owners do not feel sympathy for other people when they, like the wealthiest woman of Australia, Jean Reinhard, who owns mines on the continent, complain that their giant ships do not have room for docking.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marin for vessels 50 meters away.
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to intestine cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol drinks a week increase the risk of cancer.
This is written in Daily Express.
Experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week is linked to an increased risk of cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of the development of the disease increases with the increase in the number of alcohol used.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of basket cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the precise reason for the development of this type of cancer by noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, and more precisely, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But they don't even know how much four - legged plants are actually developed.
For many years biologists have conducted various experiments to undoubtedly learn how to develop intelligence in animals.
Although the vocabulary of the dog is not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or write poems, nothing in politics, economy, and art, but often they've been able to fool their masters.
Representatives of some species, consider experts, show better results in understanding human language, but statistics for accurate findings are not yet sufficient.
For example, some species have traditionally been regarded as dog geniuses, such as labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that their learning ability does not yield to a two - year - old child.

Prepared for the U.S. and Russia trade in Ukraine
The United States and Russia will “travel” over the entry of Ukraine to NATO, analyst Alexander Cochatkov in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were about to continue negotiations on United States safeguards that Ukraine would not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Baiden on the right of countries to “to enter anywhere”.
If you're being offered something deliberately inappropriate, well, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, but just send the offerer.
In respect of Ukraine, a bid, said an analyst.
Kolkkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparations are carried out secretly, quickly and immediately, and they do not wait until the group finds and deploys the force of resistance,” he said.
China is catalysing the development of the railway industry
Chinese advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries in the China International Real Transport and Equipment Exhibition, 2021, held in the city of Zhuzhou of Junan Province/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. have enabled trains to automatically identify and detect technical malfunctions, noted by the representative of Hou Zhaowen.
The high-speed trains on the China-Laos railway, which was introduced into operation early this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the export of railway vehicles and many Asian and European countries are witnessing China speed.
In May this year, CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd combined the first two-stage high-speed electrical trains developed in China for export to Europe.
At the maximum operating speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be travelling along the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the subway train developed by the company for Turkey began to be tested.
The train will travel through a subway connecting the Istanbul centre to the city airport.
The Metro will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest line of the subway in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The China Manufacture for Rail Transport Equipment is one of the highest innovations industry and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Fen Yaozian, head of the Chinese Committee for International Trade Promotion/CCDMT/.
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-grade equipment production in the world market,” said Fen Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, with a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full set of support tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Fan Yaoxian, the country is the first to be electrified by railways and on high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed early signs of dementation
The biological science candidate, Simeon Goloshakien, in an interview with radio Sputnik, listed early signs of dementia.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as concentration failure, planning, abstract thinking reduction.
Discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said the expert.
Goloshakien stressed that the causes of dementia could be neurogenegenic disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a shortage of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of brain receptacles are the most common causes of this syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date the medical community did not know how to deal with dementia effectively.
It must therefore begin to be prevented in a timely manner.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of dementia development.
WHO also recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical load, regularly training cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive integration of memory and the logic of thinking
“There are recommendations for the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still discussed in the scientific community,” said Goloshakin.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of moderate physical loads, regular cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbies that require intensive integration of memory and the logic of thought,” said Goloshakien.
Previously, a charitable dementia research organization in Britain stated that the disease is increasingly affected by people aged 40 years.
Medicines called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first warning sign is the problems of vision, which make it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of the emerging weakness of the professionals has called aphasia - a state where a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded that Saakashvili be sent to treatment abroad
The former President of Georgia, Mikhail Saakashvili, in need of mental treatment and rehabilitation abroad, stated to journalists, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical conciliation established at the Georgian ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his disease.
The static challenges are the problems of movement, coordination, variability of character," said the expert, noting that this is not out of the normative framework and that the ex-President now needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neurorealization and psychoner rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia,” said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that is not in Georgia.
In the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after the prison staff had been disciplined.
Georgian policy has quickly succeeded in lifting the punishment and restoring itself to previous rights.

In Spain protests against COVID-passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were carried out, transmitting the Europa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of share participants was about 3,000.
In Barcelona COVID, passports became mandatory for bars, restaurants, gymnasiums, old houses and night entertainment facilities.
Many manipestanes have come to an action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia passports on vaccination, more than 50 persons will also be required to enter entering entertainment institutions and restaurants.
Protesters in this town reported a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of cronavirus infection have been detected since the pandemic began, and over 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for non-vaccinated persons.
On 12 November, the Government introduced legislation on a single QR code system.
The Russians are expected to be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, food and retail facilities, with either a vaccination certificate or a trans-disease certificate or a vaccination vaccination nurse.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and aircraft.

Brilliant rise: How the Chinese become mining skiers
Olympics must attract millions of people to the slopes and help to create international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will allow President Si Jinpin to gather 1 trillion Yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of remote provinces.
The mining curort of Taiwan in Zhangziakou, near the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greenhouse works are also under way: the trees are planted by workers.
There are more than 700 mining resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangziakou, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for a long-term perspective is to provide comfortable and interesting rest on Chinese resorts so that all newcomers will become elusive.
But it's still far away.
The Advisor for Games Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese field industry had changed to ignorance.
Every year, more Chinese are on the slopes.
Fiona, a Pekin Snowbird, one of them.
Despite serious changes, many years will be needed to create a mining culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are still to be actively developed and built up the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a bump of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, no local resident was suffering without work.
There is an increasing number of shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, the common drink points are opened with the foods of the national kitchen.
Now there's even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwan.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must be leaders of major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment to reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, stated at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be brought to extreme poverty because of the crownavirus pandemic, which has hampered the progress of mankind in universal access to health services, stated in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Services, on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to medical malfunctions and had caused excessive volatility in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, population coverage has declined, deaths from tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
In WHO and VB, the pandemic has been “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, and it has become more difficult for people to pay for treatment”.
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pockets.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the cronavirus pandemic had brought more than 100 million people into poverty, more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: The Thai Minister was dismissed from broadcasting at the "Sammit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The presentation by the Minister of Digital Technology of Taiwan, Audrey Tan, at a panel discussion during the U.S. "The Samita for Democracy" was translated into a non-video mode, showing a YouTube summit record.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was disconnected at the request of the White House.
They reported that the map on which Taiwan was selected in a separate colour from the CIS, which considered the island to be its territory, was the reason.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the world to ensure civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green as free, and the DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam were red as "closed."
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenshot, noting that the views of the panellists “do not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The CPD was not invited to the Council for Democracy.
Reuters have noted that the map shown by the Thai Minister could be contrary to the “one China” policy of Washington.
One of the sources of the agency stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council had been angry with the State Department, in accusing him of showing Taiwan by a separate country.
The Sammit for Democracy, organized by Washington, took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the Zero Day Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize, the chief editor of the New newspaper, Dmitry Murattov, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be paid to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of Sowbeza RF Yury Averyanov stated that the summit was “antirosy and anti-China charges”.

Egoist-divorce table set with gold (4 items).
The Royal Child Collection is one of the widest and most famous collections of child silver in Russia.
It contains many charming models of silver spoons, forks and knives, sinks and deserts, pilgrims and circles.
All child silver devices undergo strict quality control.
Environmental silver produced directly in the factory, careful hand-walking with cotton sticks make the articles completely safe for the child.
With the dysynthesis of silver, the regular use of silver instruments can support the natural immunity of the organism and even prevent some of the typical childhood diseases.
Factory specialists were given a grant to the use of complex but very beautiful guilding techniques used by a well-known Karl Faberge.
This made it possible to create amazingly bright and volume pictures on the articles.
The collection is filled with lovely characters that will become true friends for the child.

The new Shepard spacecraft, with six tourists on board, took a sub-orbital flight
The new Shepard spacecraft of the Blue Origin company, with six tourists on board, took a sub-orbital flight on Saturday, 11 December.
A total of more than 10 minutes of travel on the company's website, after which the capsule and the passengers went down to Earth, reports the TASS.
The launching of the vehicle was carried out from a cosmodroma in the area of Wan Horne, Texas, U.S.A.
The ship has risen to a height of some 100 kilometres, and space tourists have been vague.
The vehicle itself landed on the cosmodromium.
On 20 July, the Blue Origin company successfully carried out the first sub-orbital flight of the New Shepard ship with passengers on board.

Those who come to the cities where the land crossings are located shall, upon arrival, issue at least one nucleic acid test COVID-19.
The document states that these requirements will be applied from the day the relevant provincial level units will determine and publish the zones of those cities until 15 March 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities in which land crossings are located and which meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

In the MID, the “healthy conclusion” between Russia and the United States was reported.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sergei Ryabkov, in an interview with "Isvestam", evaluated the prospects for Moscow and Washington's relationship.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, and in part, the prospects for improving relationships are unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long way we have made with the current administration, Trump and Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, problems are related to the U.S. desire to impose Russian approaches on multiple issues.
The LIDs added that they would not risk giving optimistic predictions on prospects for better relations and would not expect Washington ' s position to change.
He explained that, except for areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
In doing so, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in international security matters and hopes that the signals will be heard, and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with U.S. Secretary Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to re-establish a dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned of the risk of vaccination by a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
COVID-19 vaccines may have allergies and need medical help, so the first locations for vaccination should not be organized at airports and shopping centres.
This was reported by TASS a virusologist, a member of RAN, a bionanotechnology, microbiology and virusology at the University of Novosibira, Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to organize vaccination points at airports and shopping centres, but I'd only do that in the first time in the health facilities.
The fact is that the probability of allergic reactions to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-alergic drugs that operate literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to the virusologist, vaccination in trade centres can be considered when experience in the use of a drug is gained.
He also stressed that it was important for the nasal vaccine to fall on the lynx in the nose.
However, the vaccine may not reach the destination if the nose prize is freezed after injection.

In Britain, 1,239 omicronesty-stal coronavirus - RT in Russian recorded for days
During the day, 1,239 new microne-stale crownvirus infections have been detected in Britain.
That's what the Sky News' report.
In particular, 1,196 new cases of “omikoron” have been reported in England, 38 have been infected with a new variety of infections in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland.
The total number of COVID-19 patients from the new strain in Britain reached 3137 people.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in pessimistic forecasts, found that in England, 75,000 people might die by April as a result of the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the omicron strain.
Sands have warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
The Spokesman of President F. Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of “aggressive acts” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “intervention” into the territory of the country.
"Some restriction on the introduction of the Russian Federation and not to be suffering alone is impossible," said the official representative of the Kremlin in the air of the television station "Russia".
The sands say it's "understanding everything in the world."
Previously, it was reported that the United States considered the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions to complicate the conversion of roubles in dollars for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, Sberbank's head, Herman Greef, is sure it's impossible.

New Caledonia residents rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final outcome of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on 12 December by a French BFM.TV telecanal.
96.5 per cent of those voted against independence.
3.51 per cent of the inhabitants of the South Pacific archipelago supported independence from France.
Results of 2.99 per cent of ballots were cancelled.
The level of participation in the vote on that day was very low: some 55 per cent of the inhabitants of the archipelago attended the plots.
In the view of the experts, the low phenomenon was due to the call by separatists to relinquish participation in the referendum because of the crownivus.
Paris refused to carry the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonia ' s people spoke in a referendum against their independence from France.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the presence of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 kilometres from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live in the archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
The 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonia Administration is in force that the region can hold a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO preconditionly considers “omekron” to be less dangerous than “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) preconditions that the “omekron” is less dangerous than the delta-stal coronavirus.
However, there are data on vaccine efficiency reductions in the new COVID-19 version.
As of 9 December, the “omikoron” has been registered in 63 countries.
“The preconditions and the significantly modified antigen protein profile of the omicron strain suggest that the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option is less effective.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (“the seriousness of the disease” - ред.) may be less severe than in “delivery”, as indicated in WHO technical report.
The organization notes that all reported cases of “omecrone” infections in the EU are still easily or unsymptomally flown.
However, the new strain is preliminaryly spreading faster than the Delta.
Two cases of omicron-stalm infection have been recorded in Russia.
They were "immunized earlier," reported the Gamalei Center.
The head of Rosbusozor Anna Popewa stated that there was no reliable evidence that the new version of the crownivus was less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, four scenarios for the Green
Ex-deputate of the Supreme Council of Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for President Vladimir Greensky in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain without Western support and perhaps compromise on Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko told about this in a publication on the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the ideal storm”, implied that Ukraine would cease to support key western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
" The Parisian decline in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export... ... internal protests and opposition of power to key FPGs (financial-industrial groups. -- Red.) " added an ex-parlamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation, “war against all”.
This projection will take place in the case of high turbulence in world policies, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership could compromise on Donbas, which could lead to a conflict within the country.
At the end of the summer, Green position will be weakened, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, will be between 50 and 55 per cent.
The third option of Ukrainian policy is the opposition to the Green People ' s and Presidential Groups, which is likely to take control of the force block and to implement the “populist initiatives”.
During such a crisis, Greensky will begin the “transformation of power”, adding Denisenko.
Another scenario is the transformation of the Green into the father of the nation.
This could result in some event that would be a major shock to society.
“The exercise must be broad enough to trigger reactions from external partners and lead to greater support for Ukraine,” said Denisenko.
This option is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technogenic catastrophe or Russia ' s aggressive actions.
The Russian side has, however, repeatedly rejected any probability of “attacking” to Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that increased military activity within Russian borders.
Previously, on 11 November, the Reiting Sociological Group survey showed that the Ukrainian President ' s rating had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This has been the lowest since the election of its Head of State.
The analysts had projected the situation in which, in the event of the upcoming elections of President of Ukraine for Green, only 21.8 per cent had been given their vote, whereas the former President of Peter Poroshenko had 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s support was expressed among all interviewed.

Arrested for an action on the Red Square, the poet says, "Eutuschenko's quote for 10 days, this is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week for ten days, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested.
The SCE student was detained in the Red Square with a poster with a Hashteg #poetrussi-great-high-speed poster.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenia Eutuschenko.
Alexander had a report on the administrative article on the refraction of public action.
The first time he was arrested on January 23, at the Pushkina Square, at a meeting in support of Alexey Naval.
"The purpose was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, and now, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost to the fall of the culture of the Russian community and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poetry on the Internet under this Hashteg," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to make his message known in more detail.
How did policemen treat you in detention this time and before?
What did the department ask when you commented on your share?
This time, staff were more correct, maximum detention, polite, as if it were not funny in the context of that word.
The Pushkins took the UMONovs and rigidly took them.
They asked standardly about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if it wasn't good, it was understandable.
Except for the four sides of the monkey, everything was very correct, but I knew what was going on.
And if they start writing their poems after this Hashtega, at least a few people, I don't want those 10 days.

Researchers explained how potatoes help fight age violations
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microellems that contribute to better blood and lower cholesterol levels.
B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fishofflavin, folic and pantine acid are found in the root.
All of these elements help to operate the systems of the body.
Potatoes also help to combat age violations.
Because of the large content of the bleeding, it is useful for a stomach-toxic tract, and regularly used can also help to prevent hypertonia and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, it is better to eat or cook roots rather than to burn on oil.
Previously, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetics, like other high glyque products.
These are foods containing carbon cells that are rapidly scattered on sugar, such as sugar, sweet, unalcoholic beverages, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Commersant ' s newspaper warned of the possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in personal subsidiaries and the increase in reprocessing capacity.
In the view of market participants, only imports will be able to accommodate product deficit at this time.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates are removed from Yandex
Candidates for flight
In 2015, owners from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites and most of them ceased to exist, says the Director, Karen Kazarian, Internet Research Institute.
But some -- Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix -- have been able to survive because of a regular change in the home name, he adds.

Matras Dimax Micro Ultimate, 160x190
Orthopedic spring mattress Micro Ultimait.
The model is convenient because it has two different surface mildness — high stiffness and a little more middle.
Only qualitative and bonuseful fillers have been included and have solely submitted for the best.
Springs: In the middle of the model, a unit of independent springs is set up by the Micronet.
This means that there are 2,000 spirals on the bedroom, which are fully autonomous.
It's their operation that gives a unique precision.
The Micropacet is the most frequent of the variety of spring blocks of Dimaks, which therefore has a vivid orthopaedic effect and is considered to be premium.
The fillers: the top and bottom of the springs are the combinations of the coyre layers and the natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface has a latex, the other has a coconut.
Such an advertising tank has long been classical because it not only transfers orthopaedic but also anatomic properties.
If the coyre provides the right back support, then the latex gives the surface adaptation to the human body.
Chehol: The model is posted in a tightened three-coated cachle Aloe Vera.
If a client wants it can be made both removable and stationary.
The total height of the article is 27 cm, the recommended load on the bedroom is 170 kg.
Guarantee and security: Guarantee period 3 years.
Matras received all necessary certificates and documents that confirm its full security and reliability in operation.
The orthopedic pen used in the mattress has a CertiPUR certificate.
Estonian scientists will search for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Technology Institute, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday, “Actual Chamber”.
The purpose of the five-year missions is to assess the fitness of the clouds of Venus and then to search for life there.
For the project, TART scholars proposed acidity and oxygen measurement tools in Venus clouds.
So far it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, nearby the Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but probably from the beginning were the planet of the earth.
A test from Venus must arrive during the third mission.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like an earthly one or whether it's different.
If it is very similar, it will be evident that earthly life did not originate on earth.
If it's different, it's probably more likely that life was born on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the Venus Life Finder project, Michael Pausalu.

The Metallites will change Russian business
The theme of the meta-hauled became a popular autumn of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction among people.
So the business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-seals and their subsequent coining.
The metaunters should be seen as continuing objective trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to develop remote interactions in pandemic conditions was tired of divisiveness and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the interest of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
From the third, they are a logical continuation of the asset digitalization trend, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are converted into a digital format.

British economist could not predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill couldn't predict 2022 because he believed that such attempts would be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be unpredictable and any trend can change.
The most important factor remains the crown-virus pandemic and, secondly, inflation, it believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increases were temporary or not.
According to the expert, it was clear before the pandemic that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and that it was time to return to relationships where interest rates, given inflation, would correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that, in the background of the pandemic, the continuation of supermassive economic policies may, in the view of some experts, lead to a new outbreak of inflation.
In addition, attention should be drawn to the issue of productivity growth, as well as poverty and climate change, as summarized by O'Neill.
Previously, Michael Schulgin, Head of the Global Research Division, Opening an Investment, reported that the dollar's positive expectations for 2022 remained, with the potential for growth less significant.
Among the risks to the Schulgin dollar, the monetary policy of the FDC, the fluctuation of oil prices and the fears of the coronavirus pandemic were identified.
I have to agree.

Russians gave about 4.5 per cent of the country ' s GDP to motor vehicles
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on new vehicles, 28 per cent more than in the same period than in the previous year, showed the statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, the equivalent amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the crownavirus pandemic.
Last September, President Vladimir Putin, at the meeting of Heads of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, said that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic gross product (GDP) in 2020.
Income in Russia leads the Korean brand of Kia.
During the 10 months of this year, he was able to carry 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
Hyundai ' s native Kia mark has an even higher growth rate of over 35 per cent, and car sales are estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand and the average weighted price of the car - Hyundai has grown almost 21 per cent in a year, up to 1.94 million roubles - the stronger travel pattern was only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the sales of Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to statistics by the Committee of Autoproducers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4 per cent more than a year earlier in the same period.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The three of the tops of the sales of the Japanese Toyota - Russian cars spent 10 months with 275.5 billion roubles, 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
Japan follows Mercedes-Benz, with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent), and sales (37 per cent) increased by the German prize and the average weighted price of the car (at 28 per cent, to 8.2 million roubles).
"In Mercedes-Benz, there is a good increase in sales and the average price -- more, for example, than in BMW -- from here and a higher growth in the financial capacity -- explained the NAPI genitor Tatijan Arabaji.
The fiction of Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased financial capacity this year, is demonstrated by the growth of sales.”
The Russian Lada on income growth shows the average market (plus 28 per cent), and Russian cars spent 229.4 billion roubles in 10 months.
At last year's financial capacity, there are companies whose sales of cars fell in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ, and at a very low point, spent 12 billion roubles in 10 months on the extra-roads and peaks of this mark, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
Against the backdrop of problems with the supply of motor vehicles and disruptions in production covering the entire world ' s cars, automobiles continue to continuously adjust prices - the same “AutoWAS” increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, and the last trip (8-10,000 roubles) took place at the end of November.
Regularly copy prices to their products and other autoproducers.
Experts believe that the volume of the Russian road market in monetary terms will continue to increase, in addition to the deficit of machines, its contribution to this is inflation, as well as the desire for autoconcerting to reap past losses.
With a deficit of cars, I think that many auto-concerns have even been able to put consumers in part the costs of past periods that they couldn't put in the price of cars before,
says VTC Capilal analyst on Vladimir Buffalo.
I believe that financially, autoproducers feel very good now, supporting the high marketing marginality."
The indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars observed during 2021, the prices for new machines are increasing faster than inflation, and the expert is clarifying.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but largely through inflation and complexity in the design of machines itself, predicts Bepalov.
With the increase in supply, price increases will be limited.
In the cash expression, the Russian authors will continue to grow in the next year, even if the increase in the cost of cars is slowing, autoproducers will be able to obtain their income from the amounts, notes the independent consultant for the automobile supply of Sergei Burgazliev.
In view of increased demand and insufficient supply, autoproducers are now seeking the greatest profit from each sold car, notes Burgasliy. -
The production of cars is not expected to increase at least in the next six months, with the insecurity of citizens in Russia being heated in the future.
In the background of the market situation, the cars have proved to be a good investment facility -- a purchased year ago, even with a run, can now be sold more expensive than the original value, the expert notes.
Baiden referred to the transfer of military US to Ukraine in the event of Russia ' s invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered the sending of American military to Ukraine in the case of Russia ' s invasion.
This statement was made by President Joe Baiden of the United States.
"Never had any such plans," said the White House head, answering the journalist's question as to whether the United States had abandoned that idea.
Baiden noted that in the event of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of unilateral use of American troops for Ukraine ' s defence should not be on the agenda.
Baiden explained that if Russia invaded the territory of Ukraine, the United States would move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary).
"We have to send more American and Nato troops to the eastern flank, B9 -- all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect them against any attack by Russia," said Biden.
Previously, the Spokesman of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow lacked intentions to enter the territory of Ukraine.
He pointed out, however, that Moscow sees the problem of the use of Kiev by Turkey of the drons and that “American armaments are approaching our territory”.
