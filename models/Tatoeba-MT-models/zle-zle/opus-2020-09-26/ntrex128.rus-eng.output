Welsh Assembly members do not want to “moppets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, it would be displeased to propose to adopt the abbreviation MWP (from the member of the Welsh Parliament, member of Wales).
A problematic solution relates to plans to change the title of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from various political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the lieborists, expressing the opinion of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “reflects the Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: on the Wally twp means "dust" and pwp "wash".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “rejected” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “no objection” to the new abbreviation but note that MWP is close to writing the word Muppet (muppet).
In this context, the letter w in the Wallis is spoken roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English dialect.
The Committee of the Assembly, which was currently drafting the draft Law on the Change of Name, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the members of the Assembly will, of course, remain behind them.”
The Welsh Management Act of 2017, the National Assembly of Wales, has the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which the version of the Wales instead of the Assembly found broad support among the local population.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee favoured the option “Party of the Wales Parliament” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the version MWP received the greatest public support.
It seems that the Assembly offers other options, but it will be difficult for the presiding member, Alice Jones, to find a convenient solution for all, and to recall that the draft amendment law should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws would include other modifications to the work process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote in favour of the final version of their name in the debate on the bill.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia will vote on the renaming of the country as the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims for the Greek province and has repeatedly opposed its northern neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, opposed to the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that a change in the country ' s name is the entire price of EU and NATO accession.
Crisis in the harlems: the bells of St. Martin are always entangled.
“ The circuit I was talking to was mentioned earlier at every corner of the bar and through the church, ” relates Adams.
“Now there is no one left.”
The disappearance of the bars is still clear:
“The form of communication has changed.”
“Bar has ceased to be a kind of sitting-room of the entire area to which he has come regularly.”
But as regards the churches, it is a matter of concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be long enough, no matter how much their leaders trusted.
At the place of the church, he added, there would be a multifamily house whose residents would not be able to support the remaining parishes in the area.
“The majority of buyers of these apartments will be white, ” Adams believes.
Both churches were constructed by white assembly before Harlem became a black area: Metropolitan Communitis in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first motivated methodist church left the coming in the 1930s of the last century.
Their building was purchased by a black coming nearby.
When St. Martin's church came into the hands of the black community, it was chaired by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of stores on 125th Street, the main commercial artery of Harlem where they refused to work or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged as a result of the fire, and during the rehabilitation work, father Johnson ordered a carillon installation.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Johnson, who replaced him at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the Carillon “poor colons for the poor”.
But the expert, who tested the carillon in July, called it the “cultural heritage” and the “unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was a carillon from St. Martin’s Church that was the first in the world to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merryweser, St. Martin’s church has not yet found a replacement for him.
The last few months around St. Martin’s Church had a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The congression, the governing body of the coming of the secular leaders, turned to the eparchy in July, expressing concern that the episode “will try to transfer the cost of work” to the parishioners, although the latter did not relate to the choice of the architects and contractors sent by the eparchy.
Some of the parishioners expressed dissatisfaction over the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old nudger who was an mining lobster
Official sources reported that on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diverger in California had been attacked by a shark and had suffered bodily injuries.
The attack took place about seven o'clock in the morning near the Beach Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview of the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends and about half an hour later he heard the boy screaming for help, and with friends they sailed on the boat to the location of the attack and pulled a teenager out of the water.
According to Hammela, at first he decided that the boy was loudly happy to catch a lobster, but quickly “saw that he shouted, ‘ I have bitten!
I have been bitten!"
As he approached the diver, Hammel observed that “he had completely ripped his skin around the key.”
“I yelled for everyone to get out of the water, ‘ Here's the shark!' ”
A helicopter boy was taken to the Radi Children ' s Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The view of a shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Gayles, reported during the press briefing that a shark had been noticed there a few weeks ago but had not been classified as dangerous species.
Gails also added that the victim was injured in the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed the zone from the Ponto Beach in Casablade to the Swami beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Gails noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to conquer British perfumerous cosmetic market
Seinsbury is about to establish cosmetics and perfumeria divisions in Bouts, Superdrag and Debenhems stores with cosmetologists, a model of luxury umbrella.
The British portfümer and cosmetic market is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while the sales of fashions and goods for houses are falling. In order to capture a large share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 shops throughout the country, spatial cosmetics and perfumeria divisions will be represented, and if success is expected next year, in many other shops.
The supermarket owners are looking for more than filling the shelves that were previously placed under television, microwave kilns, home products and investments in the perfumerous and cosmetic market are a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the assortment of cosmetic products to 3,000 names; including for the first time, marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially chosen locations, by type of organization of goods in Bouts stores.
In addition, the Boutic-Cosmetic product line will be reorganized with vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two shops in Seinsbury will be represented by fragrance Shop perfume producers, the first of which was already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Selly Ouk, Burmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small amount of food per day in small shops near the house have led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Seinsbury, says that the autlets will gradually turn into umbrella, and the network of his supermarkets is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops such as Aldi and Lydle, offering more services and non-food goods.
In hundreds of Sainsbury supermarkets, Argos autlets are deployed, and some of them now have Habitats stores since the network acquired both marks two years ago, which has led to the growth of food sales and profits from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to give new life to their cosmetic and pharmacy departments have failed.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture was organized by Seinsbury and Bouts, but there were further differences between the participants on the partition of the income from the sale of pharmacy in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury pharmaceutical business (all 281 shops) of Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for £12 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a broad line of luxury for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Says Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director of Seinsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfumeration and cosmetics divisions to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants, who will always be willing to help with the advice.
Our markings, any taste, nice design and comfortable shopping will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumeria, and this will be a completely new concept of shopping.
Peter Jones reacted “firely” to Holly Willowby's exit from the 11 million pounds deal
The Star of the Dragon Lagos show Peter Jones “disbursed” by the Gollie Willowby TV leader from the 11 million pounds of sterling, which she intended to conclude with the Laifstile Brend Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint home dress mark and Truly appetite.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop actress Mark Guinet Peltrou.
The 37-year-old lead programme, this morning, announced its decision in Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowby to leave their profitable Lifstayl Brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV led to the anger of Peter Jones, the Star of the Lagoon of the Dragon.
According to our sources, Jones was “disaffected” when a lover of television at a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlou, Buckinghamshire, admitted that the cost of up to 1.5 million new contracts would not be sufficient time for their common home dress mark and Truly accessaries.
Their stamp was compared to the child actress, Guinet Peltrou Mark Goop, and it was expected that its sales would double the value of Willowbi, estimated at £11 million.
The 37-year-old leader announced her departure in Instagram, but Johns himself left Britain on a private plane towards one of his villas.
According to one source, “the Truly mark was the main priority of Holly.
This was a long-term investment that would ensure that it had a safe existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led to the degree of all parties to the transaction.
Everyone was amazed at what took place on Tuesday, since before the mark was launched, there were weeks of count.
The whole warehouse, filled with sales ready, remained at headquarters in Marlou.”
Experts believe that taking the lead this morning, one of Britain’s most popular stars, can cost a firm millions of pounds of sterlings due to significant investments in goods, from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as potential delays in the launching of the line.
In addition, it is a breakdown of long-standing friendly relations.
The three children raised by Willowbi and her husband, Dan Boldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years now.
Willowbi created the Truly stamp with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of the shares of Dan Boldoin's television company.
Willowbi will be the Ambassador of the M&S and replace Anthony McPartlin as the leading ITV transfer, "I'm famous."
A source from an intimate neighborhood of Jones said last night, "We can't comment on his business."
Complex talks, “and then we loved each other”
He was sorry for the criticism he would be attacked by the media because of the “whole President” commentary and the commendation of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump renounce such claims?
He said Trump, imitating the voice of the leading news.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim Chen Yen was interested in a re-study meeting, after calling them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards the reduction of nuclear weapons stockpiles in North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks are staggering.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking diplomat Li Yon Ho of North Korea addressed the world leaders at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, stating that North Korea is still awaiting “conforming response” from the United States following the initial disarmament measures of the DPRK.
Instead, the United States, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a force of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump made a much more optimistic assessment.
“Northern Korea is a great thing to do, ” he said.
“We were at the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions could die.
And now we have a good relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yun had yielded fruits: the missile tests had ended, hostages were released, and United States soldiers who remained in the DPRK also returned to their homeland.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Jung Yun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not strange.
“It is easy to think of yourself as a good President, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street that tear up in this completely slain hall, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, victims counted as hundreds
In the first days after the Lombo earthquake, foreign NGOs said that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost their rooftop, the Government did not find it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which was a mandatory requirement for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that there was no need for international support, so it was difficult,” says Celina Sambung.
Save the Children prepares a team for sending to Pala, but we do not yet know whether a foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether to involve international organizations.
In view of the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains appallingly poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite warnings about the tsunami threat, there was no raw materials in Palu to warn the population, which is likely to result in so many casualties.
Transportation between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously швартated in Lomboka to assist the victims of the earthquake is being sent to Pala, but the road will take at least three days to the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Vidododo has made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s old infrastructure the main focus of his election campaign and has spent inexpensive funds on improving roads and railways.
However, the President ' s administration of Joco, which runs for a new term next year, has been embarrassed by funding problems.
The President is also criticized for increasing interfaith hostility between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people have been killed, and tens of thousands have lost their shelter as a result of collisions between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other jamheads.

The Memorandum of Cromwell to the Parliamentary Building led to a violent discussion on “Repeat of History”
Cromwell’s exile would be a well-deserved retaliation for the barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memory Society referred to Mr. Crik as a “invasion” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmite, president of the Cromwell Memory Society, stated: “In the ongoing debate on the demolition of historical monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell’s statue was inevitably raised before the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the Iconocyan movement during the British civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is likely suffering for the sins of his forefather Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Sir William Hamo Thornikroft, Cromwell, reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of the human being, which many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview, The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmit stated: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be a protector of Parliament from external pressure, in his case monarchy.
Whether this view can be considered historically accurate, it remains the subject of the debate of professionals.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that emerged in the mid-17th century had affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was an important historical figure representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as the Lord of the Protector are also commendable and respectworthy.”
China ' s farmer is dying of a killer pig
In one market in southwestern China, a farmer was a victim of pigs, and local media were reported.
The surviving body of the victim (in the media mentions only his name, Yuan), with the broken artery, was discovered near the jelly in the market area of Lupanshui Province of Guichhou in southern China, reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
The leader is preparing to vaccinate pigs in the pig farm, 30 May 2005, Bluein of the Chinese province of Tsinhai.
Yuan and his cousin came from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs to sell.
The next morning, the cousin discovered the breathless body of Yuan, and the door to the neighboring pig was opened.
There was a huge cartworm in the pig with the blood on the rim.
During the forensic examination, it was found that the pig weighed 250 kilograms of pigs roaring the farmer to die.
“My brother’s legs were bloody and crippled, ” said Guyang Evening News Woo, a relative of the murdered man.
The video from surveillance cameras showed that Yuan came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed its animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate castle for the time of investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuanan family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
The incidents of pig attacks on people are not common.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S. state, seriously traumatized a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal screwed a Walley peasant into a tractor and released, just frightened by a subsexed wife.
In 2012, a farmer from the state of Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, and according to one Canadian farmer’s CBC News channel, the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as “the drainage mechanism”.
“Pigs of games,
They're bitter and very curious, but they don't have the goal of hurting you.
You should simply impart to your animals a sense of measure and respect”, he explained.
The Rasa Hurricane will bring rainfall to a large part of the South-West of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to lose strength by moving through the cooler zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring rainfall and floods to the territory of northern Mexico and the South-West of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached 1st category with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 kilometres south-west of the city of Punta Euchenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low-pressure zone that will travel eastward to the western coast of the United States, and the storm will bring tropical humidity to the south-west of the United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected on Monday in Mexico.
The tropical humidity in the forming low-pressure zone will lead to heavy rainfall in the coming days in the South-West.
Precipitations between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rainwater, dirty streams and possible desert landslides.
In some areas, particularly in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona, due to high tropical air humidity, rainfall speeds can reach between 5 and 8 cm per hour.
In selected areas of the south-west of the United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5-10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods is not excluded by uneven distribution of tropical rains.
With the current risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Livns can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause the winds to burst out and the clouds of dust.
With low pressure on the coast of southern California, the rains are falling.
It is possible to fall to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small dirty streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
These are the first rainfall in the region since the beginning of the rainy season.
On Sunday night and morning, the tropical rains in Arizona will take place on Monday night and morning on the afternoon of Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the rains will pass in the area of the Four corners and take a long time until midnight.
In October, temperatures will be sharply overflowed throughout the United States, owing to the low air temperature in the Arctic, with enough temperatures in the tropics.
At times, such a combination leads to severe overlaps in a small area.
Such sharp temperature changes will be particularly noticeable in the central United States on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between Saint Luis and DeMonnes, Iowa, there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, summer heat will be accumulated and extended to other territories.
In most of the United States central and eastern territories, warm weather is expected in early October, the temperature will be up to 27 degrees from the South plains to the North-East.
In New York, air temperature can rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises high temperatures on the east coast of the U.S. until mid-October.
Senate hearings in the case of Judge Bretta Kavano looked over 20 million
Brett Kavano and Cristina Blazi Ford, which accused Kavano of attempting to rape in the 1980s, received the attention of over 20 million spectators of six telecanals on Thursday.
The political opposition to the Cavano candidature was unexpectedly continued, with an urgent report on Friday to the media: Jeff Flake, Republican, made the condition that the charges against a lawyer should be investigated within one week by the FBI.
As Ford stated at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she “100 per cent” believed that the Kavano had attacked her and tried to sabotage her at the school party.
Cavano gave emotional testimony, stating that he was 100 per cent confident that this was not the case.
According to the research agency Nielsen, more than 20.4 million spectators were watching Friday debates.
The Agency took the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the rating of Nielsen does not always take into account the audience watching TV at work.
For comparison, it is the average audience following the American football match in the Flei or the Oscar service ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly supported the appointment of Kavano: Senate hearings that lasted all day looked at an average of 5.69 million audiences, reported the Nielsen Agency.
The second is ABC from 3.26 million audiences.
The CBS auditorium was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million audiences, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After hearing, the interest in the case was not weakened.
The real drama with Jeff Flake was played on Friday.
After the Senator from Arizona, considered a moderate republican, announced his intention to support the candidature of Kavano, CNN and CBS, the camera was sealed on Friday morning, on the way to the meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake faced a group of activists who had criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him dropping his eyes and getting a blow from angry women in a direct CNN air.
“I am standing in front of you, ” said one of them.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“You have the power, while so many women are powerless,” she tried to explain her position.
Flake told the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on the subject at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors were closed by hiding the senator from all over the rooms.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve the nomination of Kavano for a judge and to send it to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast a meeting in direct air.
However, Flake made one condition — to investigate the FBI on the charges against the candidate by the next week, as the democratic minority had sought.
Flake claims to have changed his view by the intervention of a friend, senator from the Democrats of Chris Kunes.
He made a final decision by talking to Kuns and several more senators.
Flake's decision had the effect, since it was evident that the Republicans lacked votes to approve the Kavano without conducting an investigation.
The FBI decree of the President ' s Tramp opened the investigation of the charges against Kavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview of Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticize her plan to leave the European Union of placing narrow-party interests above the interests of society.
The British Prime Minister arrives at a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published on the May interview, former head of the MID Boris Johnson criticized its so-called plan “Shaschi” in Brexit, stating that he considered the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU to be “absolutely improper”.
The death of Wade Syms was fired: the police arrested Daniel Simpson on suspicion of murder of the Forward University of Louisiana

During his interrogation, Simpson admitted that Wade was fatally wounded.
According to Advocate, a bail of $350,000 is set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern Bathon-Ruja County issued a preliminary opinion on Friday: death was caused by a cross-cutting firearm wound of the neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Division for Criminal Investigation of the State of Louisiana Police, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents who have assisted in expeditious and searching activities that have led to detention.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good work on the criminal's screening”.
Symsu was only 20 years old.
The two-metre forward was Bathon Ruja, and his father, Wayne, was also a member of the Louisiana University team.
In the last season, Sims collected 5.6 points and made 2.6 picks for the average match.
The team trainer Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Sims had caused the “sock” and the “real woe” of all players.
"That's what I always feared," added the coach.
Volcan has covered Mexico City's ashtray.
The Popokatepetl volcano fell to the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population not approach the volcano: 183 perished peragogaz emissions were recorded in its crater.
According to the Centre, the volcanic roars and trembling were often spread near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochilko, social network users have published photos of lobster panes covered by fine ashes.
After the earthquake, 7.1 Mw, which hit the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics captured the increased volcanic activity of 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its own, “Don Goo”) is an active volcano since 1994.

On Saturday, a multi-twenty meeting was held in Barcelona on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps, and there were no clashes between the independence of autonomy and the police; and six rioters were detained.
Police officers pushed the protesters against independence, while the last black masked were thrown into prisons by eggs and powder paint, raising clouds of dark dust at the very centre of Barcelona.
After the police had emptied the oven to deter the crowd, the turmoil renewed with a new force.
During a few hours, the advocates of independence scanded, “We shall not forget, we shall not be simple”, and their opponents answered them with a slogan, “Let Spain live.”
According to the local press, fourteen participants were hospitalized with light wounds.
The referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain was held on 1 October last year and was recognized as illegal by the Spanish Government but as a milestone for separatists.
The Catalonia, with an enormous surge, voted for the withdrawal from Spain, but the appearance was low due to the fact that the opposers of exit were predominantly boycotting the referendum.
Catalan official sources reported that in the last year, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes in attempts by the police to block a referendum at the polling stations of the country.
On Friday, the separatists spent nights on the stated course of conducting a demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent its conduct.
The demonstration still took place, but it went on another route.
The 68-year-old electric Narciss Termes, who visited his wife's separatist visit, is struggling with the hope of acquiring the Catalonia of sovereignty.
“One of the most important events in our life took place last year.
My parents wept for happiness, having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a hanging state," he says.
In the recent December elections to local authorities, Catalonian parties in favour of Spain have won an important victory, even with a small breakthrough, but in this year their movement is losing supporters because many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either in flight or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puuch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording a police visit, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is increasing, ” he added.
On Saturday, Oriole Junceras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, who have been in prison since the end of the past year, announced his intention to join the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he says.
Londonders: The car crashed into the house, all three fellows arrested
One of the London Berry houses was several times trafficked; men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested.
The visit was carried out on Thursday, about 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Cresent area.
As a result of the packaging, the gate and the building itself were damaged, reports the criminal police inspector Bob Blemmings.
There's reports that a shot from the bow could have been fired into the car.
Livingston's victory over Reingers thanks to the Mengi Half-Mangi
The first Goal of Dolly Menga brought a guaranteed victory to Livingston
With Livingston's killed ball, Reingers won an unexpected victory, for the Scotland Club's chief coach, Stephen Jerard, this is only a second defeat for 18 games.
The exact impact of Dolly Mengie equated Gary Hall with the Hibernian Club in a table, where they divide the second.
The Jerrard Club was left without a victory at the Premier League season, and on Sunday, they are to meet with the leaders of the group, Harts, from whom Reingers stand up to eight points.
On Thursday, Reingers will conduct a match to the League of Europe in its field with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
Livingston's Club continues its unwindless series in the Division, playing six matches, and has not been defeated since Holt changed Kenny Miller as chief team coach.
Lost moments for Livingston in the rival guests
Holt's trust coach had to keep an account from the outset, and the “raingers” obviously failed to cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of protection, but the naked of his weak attempts did not come out, and then Alan Litgo's defender, swinging too wide, couldn't prevent Caig Halkette's ball from coming on the grid.
The host party allowed Reingers to play before their line of protection, relying on dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That's how they missed that important naked.
Reingers retreated the free strike, and Livingston took the opportunity: the Declaration of Gallager and Robinson made the transfer of Menge, which had slain from the central position.
At that point, Reingers had superiority in owning the ball, but the protection of the host team was untested, so Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time was going on in the same pattern, although Kelly had to beat Alfredo Morelos.
The enemy of Reingers, Allan McGregor, kicked a ball from Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a broad reference from the standard provision.
The balls were constantly in the Lingston fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two demands of the toolbars — one for provoking Glenn Middlton Halkette and the other by hand — were not satisfied.
Livingston's Funal Game - analysis
From BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, report from Tony Macaroni Arena Stadium
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
Absolutely all the players were great, and once again, they were out of expectations, continuing to climb the soccer Olympus.
Their play style and composition have not changed from the time they come up to the top of the rating, and the great merit of coach Holt is that he was mobilizing this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkette led an excellently organized protection, and Manga didn't let Connor Goldson and Joe Warorall relax.
Reingers could not enter the rhythm at all.
Although they had good game moments with Jerard coach, this time they didn't vindicate our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they lacked possession of the ball, but only one day they were able to protect the host team.
Erdogan ' s cool admission during the visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met at breakfast, there was a beautiful weather, and both of them were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO parties — the visit, and already the result of some conflicts.
Heads of country were unable to find understanding on such issues as human rights, press freedom and Turkish accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to participate in the opening ceremony for a huge new mosque.
Kelne is the largest Turkish diaspora living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousands-to-four crowd to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan set up nearby to see their President.
In the same place, the opposers of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurdah, also gathered together to condemn in full both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to a visit to Germany.
The existence of radically contrary views at the meeting reflects the ambiguity of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalted Erdogana, while others regarded it as tyrant.
Deptford road accident: collision with a car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, the car encountered a cyclist who died at the scene.
An accident occurred near Becousud Street and Evelyn Street, a lively crossroads in the south-eastern part of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the cyclists who arrived at the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometres from the scene of the accident, on the Childers Street Street, another cyclist was hit by a vehicle whose driver hid.
The London Police reports that work is under way to identify the deceased and inform his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads are closed and bus routes are changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Unrest in Long Lartin prison: six police officers wounded
According to the Administration of Long-Lartin, six policemen were injured during the riots perpetrated in the male prison.
In the Lung Lartin strict prison (Wustershire) on Sunday, the turmoil continued to be tied up to 9:30 local time.
In order to suppress the turmoil of eight prisoners from one wing, the opera group “Tornado” was called.
Police were slightly damaged to the soft tissues of the person and received medical assistance on the ground.
According to the official of the prison, “in order to resolve the incident in the Long Lartin correctional facility, specially trained staff were brought into the prison.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically reprove the use of physical force in our establishment, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measures may be changed for a longer period.”
Long-Lartin currently holds over 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hit by an inmate in the hospital.
Last October, the prison leadership had to involve special-purpose units in order to relieve the inflammated prisoners who had thrown the balloons into the supervisors.
Rosa may flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the drylands)
Arison rarely enters the intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it is “lucky”: Hurricane Rosa, after making the last slice, must pass over the desert part of the South-West and pose a risk to the floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of rainwater floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and east of the State of Nevada, south-eastern California and Uta, including in cities such as Fenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass through a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and sheds rain on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service office in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “three tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression in a radius of 320 km from Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arison border.”
According to recent projections of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, reaching 15 cm on the Arison Plateau of Mogollion-Rim.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the central Scalistic Mountains and the Big Bassain, up to 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, sediments can reach 10 cm.
For zones with streams of rain, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, since the region has long suffered from drought.
Although floods may pose a danger, high rains can facilitate dry seasons not occurring in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory has at least a strong drought (second by gravity)”, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will be attacked by Mexico’s state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 kilometres south of the town of Punta Euchenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane found himself in a cooler area on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
During the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of Tropical Storm.
In some parts of Mexico, flood-threatening rains are expected to take place.
“In the territory from the Lower California to the north-west of the Sonora, it may fall to 7 to 10 cm of precipitation, up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Then, Hurricane Rosa will head north across Mexico and, on the morning of Tuesday, reach the border with Arison in the tropical cyclone, from Arizona, to the southern part of Utah state by Tuesday evening.
“The major potential risk posed by hurricane Rosa and its remnants is the heavy rainfall in the Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert areas of the South-West United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
Precipitation is expected to cause dangerous rainwater floods, dirty streams in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Attack in Midsomer Northon: Detained four suspects of attempted murder
In Commerce, a 16-year-old was severely wounded and three teenagers and a 20-year-old were suspected of attempting murder.
A serious injury victim was discovered in the area of Midsomer Norton, Excelsior Terras, about 4 p.m. on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “steady”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock region, reports the Avon and Somerset police.
The police are looking for possible witnesses of the crime with any video recording on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “The whole hatred, all the malice” of democrats was “in Kavano”
“The Voice for Judge Kavano is a vote against the ruthless and resentful tactics applied by democrats,” said the Trump at the meeting of his fellows in Wiling, West Virginia.
In Trump's view, the Cavano nomination of the candidate has “invaded all hatred and all malice” of the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Kavano gave testimony to the United States Congress, in his emotional treatment categorically rejecting Christina Blazi Ford's accusation that he sexually sought her more than 30 years ago when both were adolescents.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class and courage”, Kavano.
“The Voice for allegation of Judge Kavano is a vote for the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unpunished public record of service,” declared the President of the crowd of his fellows in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the question of the nomination of Kavano, referring to the importance of the Republicans to the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“Prior to the most important elections in our lives, there are only five weeks left.
I don't take part in them, but I'm taking part in the race in a different sense," he said.
"I'm hardened up and fighting for our great candidates."
The Trump believes that the democrats have set the task of “to resist us in every way”.
In accordance with the rules, the first key ballot at the Cavano Candidate shall be held no later than Friday, and the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party has reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, and many had been smashed by giant waves that took over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulaves, which had hit an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
On Friday, the beach festival in Palu was hit by waves of nearly six feet [6 m] high, which dared all on their way and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed the magnetud 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of fleeing immediately to shelter and thus losing their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Disaster Management Office during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, there were cars, logs, whole houses, the elements destroyed everything on their way,” explained Nugroho, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and collapsed to the coast.
Some of those present came to the trees, which saved their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
At aerophoto survey of disaster management, houses, shops, bridges and mosques have been destroyed.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground pushes.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the Territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The Agency ' s statement on the assessment and use of technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the energy emissions caused by the earthquake were about 200 times higher than the explosion of atomic bomb destroyed by Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have proved stronger than expected by the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow gulf.
Nugroho referred to damage as “majorous”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, commercial centres and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of the damaged buildings, the bodies of the deceased were discovered; 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho added that victims and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 kilometres from Pala, at the Dungala site, which was closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
Communications with Dungal were “fullly destroyed, no information received”.
“More than 300,000 people live in the Dungal area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already gone to the disaster zone.
“The tragedy has taken place, but it is not yet a limit,” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because the tsunami had not been reported on time in Pala, but the authorities believed that waves had reached the coast as the initial warning was still in force.
Amateur video appeared in the social networks where a man on the top of the building shouts about the tsunami coming, desperately trying to attract the attention of the people on the street.
After a few minutes, the wall of water erupts on the shore, carrying entire homes and cars with it.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the sponsorship of this role.
The earthquake and the tsunami resulted in large electrical deterioration, which left Pala unaccompanied, making it very difficult for rescue services.
Military transportation aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but evacuated populations still lacked food and essential supplies, and government sources reported.
The city airport was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, President Joco Vidododo's evacuation centers in Palu.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the charity organization World Vision have successfully arrived from Dungala to Pala, where the staff have found shelter in the palace tents broken in the yard of their office building.
“They've seen a great lot of destroyed houses, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that experts from international NCBs have failed to reach Pala.
Indonesian legislation permits the attraction of funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign-organization personnel only after the launching of a site where the scourge has hit the national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster,” reports Aulia Ariani, the Spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural scourge to a national, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but for the time being the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural catastrophe that struck Paul, friends and relatives of the missing still look forward to their marvelous salvation, which will restore the people to their faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman's building from under the siege that spent two days alongside her mother's idle body.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of Indonesia ' s national assembly on paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing pilots for recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples, including Mandaga.
“ I am not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive, ” he said.
Hendon recalls how, when he learned of Roa Roa’s breakdown from other paraplaneters, he was desperate to contact his colleagues from Palu who were resting on the beach festival for the next hours.
However, his messages were shown with one grey head, not two blue.
“This means that the messages have not been delivered,” he believes.

Several suspects were reported to have escaped from the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the New York Police Office at number 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: Rapper changed the name on Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
On Saturday in Twitter, he said, "Life formerly known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been wearing this alias and even putting it in the name of his eighth album that came out in June.
The news of this came in front of the Canje in the transfer of Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will speak as an accomplice in place of Ariana's singer, who has cancelled her participation because of “emotional anxieties”, reports the author of the communication.
West had previously stated that the name was not only a reduced version of his name but also a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, which means you, you, ” so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us.
It was first Kanier, which means “one ” and now I'm just Ye, that is, a reflection of all good, bad, misunderstandings in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Kanie's not the first famous rapper to change the name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deddy, Pi Diddy, or just Deeddy, this year asked to call himself Lav (love) or Braza Lav (Bratian Love or Brat Love).
Speaker with West Rapper Jay-Z also changed his name several times: with defis and without, with letters or strings.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
The President of Mexico, Andrez Manuel López Obrador, swore never to resort to a military force against the civilian population prior to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ending a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in the area of Tlatelolco, President Lopes Obrador promised “no time to resort to the assistance of the army to repress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired on the crowd and the massacre began, killing 300 lives, which took place against the background of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
López Obrador also promised support for Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for training and the opening of more free State universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of learning led young people directly into the criminal world.
The United States dollars needed to be doubled in financing the development of DIA
China and its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence (DI) should not underestimate — the US should double its investment in its research, believes Lee Caifa, investor and entrepreneur in the development of DI with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several U.S. ministries had previously made declarations of work on DI, although the United States as a whole did not have a clear development strategy.
At the same time, China has submitted its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in innovations of the DI by 2030.
“Increasing the MDG research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are expecting the next breakthrough in the area of DI,” said Li.
The increase in funding can double the chances of the next major achievement of FDI in the United States, said by Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Unor-States of Artificial Intellect: China, the Cremn Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the General Director of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most prominent companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie-Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that exceeded the highest player in the American Othello, and then was head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. governmental technological competitions, such as Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects agency, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“Not China absorbs academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee believes.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think Gren Cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences allocates funding to scientists as the National Scientific Fund and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China below, says Lee.
Previously this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre of Artificial Intellect, in which industrial and scientific partners should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intellect.
During this month, DARPA pledged $2 billion to the AI Next programme.
As for NSF, it now invests more than $100 million a year in the study of DI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intellect has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on a referendum on Sunday on whether the name of their country should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which blocked her application for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, consisting of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim for its territory and vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments entered into an agreement based on a new name, but nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the electoral appearance would meet the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The referendum issue was as follows: “Are you supporting NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
The successors, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that had emerged since the breakdown of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining such organizations as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they could live freely under the auspices of the European Union because that means a safer life for all of us,” explains 79-year-old Oliver Georgiewska, Skopje.
The sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would observe the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
The change in name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13,00.
However, the appearance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the recent parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dusko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way for her accession to NATO and the European Union in S Стрumitze, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the Parliamentary Building in Skopje Vladimir Kavardkov, in 54, prepared a small scene by placing chairs in front of the tents set by the citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We're for membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to combine with a high-поднятыd head, not with the thresholds of the business offices,” says Kavadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
The Prime Minister of Zaev said that NATO membership would invest in Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country, where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be for because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO”, said Zayb after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be “the foundation of our well-being.”
A survey published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this was lower than the required phenomenon.
Another survey conducted by Telecom-TV, Macedonian Telecom, found that 57 per cent of respondents were scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that number claimed to vote positively.
For the referendum to take place, the appearance should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major blow to the policy of the western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Serhio Aguero of Manchester City is circumventing the protection of Bryton to kill the naked
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were attacked with the protection of Brayton, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 on Saturday at the Zehad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero hit his head for the 65th minute, it seemed to him that he had nothing to do with it.
At the beginning of the episode, an Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He flew between the three Breiton defenders before entering the open space.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He crossed one defender and hugged a few more on the edge of the Brayton penal zone.
Then he handed the ball to the left of Sterling.
An English attacker, while in a penal zone, turned Aguero's ball in one to the right leg, hit by Matthew Ryan’s gate’s fan on the right corner.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” said the journalists, the coach of Manchester City, Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he's hit his head at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the Celestial Blue the original advantage of fighting the Prime League.
That naked was beaten for 29 minutes.
At this game, Aguero received a ball deep inside Brayton
He's given a great difference on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane has made some scrapes before giving Sterling a long-range trong transfer.
The attacking Blue and Heavenly ball hit the gate just before leaving the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim in the League Championship group on Tuesday, 12:55 at Rhine Neckar Aren in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick up the glasses at Collorado Rockiz.
After Washington Nashionals was out of battle for a play-off, there was no particular reason to inculcate events.
But he hopes to take over in the fight against “Colorado Rockiz” on Sunday, but only if the Rockis, which is preceded by the Los Angeles Dodgers game in the Western Division, faces problems in the play-off.
The victory 5-2 over Neshionals on Friday night, “Rockiz”, has already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they still hope to secure titles in the first dividen.
“Although we're just playing this, we can at least hold our positions, knowing about the enormous significance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the audience and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?'
Neshionals has not yet been declared a pitcher on Sunday, but it has been recent that Sheerzer is inclined to do so in this situation.
Sherser, who was going to go out to the 34th game on Thursday, threw a ball on the drinker's playground, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'd be a drinker.
Statisticians for the "Washington's right-wington" are 18-7 with ERA ratings 2.53 and 300 autumn in 220,2/3 innings in the current season.
The Temple conducts a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the Republican presence in the interim elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, a candidate nominated by the President to the Supreme Court.
“Everything we have done is mapped in November.
Five weeks remain to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important, and I'm not running, although I'm really running around fighting for good candidates," he said.
The trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to return power, using all the necessary means, and we are witnessing vileness and disgustingness.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, through whom they're supposed to cross, to get power and control, that's what they want -- power and control, but we're not going to give them."
The Democracies, he claims, were intended to “continue resisting and impeding”.
“And you've seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “wicked, mean, deceptive and lying”.
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, referring to the Democrat Senator Diann Finstein, which caused loud voices from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let this document leak?
Hmm... um... what document?
No, no; the tongue of the body has given it, and I have never seen the tongue of the body so refusing the words."
The Leiborist Party is no longer an organization with different views.
It is not tolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party made a suggestion of this mistrust to me, it was no surprise.
In the end, I am the last in a number of members of Parliament from the Laborist party, who has not yet been told that we are not welcome for expressing our views.
The same is true of my colleague Joan Ryan in Parliament, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, my mistrust was criticized for dissenting with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, for the irony of destiny, is a matter on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the Nottingham East Laborist Assembly notification on Friday, it was stated that “we want the congregations to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight years of office as a local member of Parliament from the Laborist party, the evenings of the GC were the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with the many meetings, but the promise of “more human and soft” policies has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that the Leiborist Party does not differ in views is increasingly evident and each opinion is evaluated as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political prospects I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and take a position with which I would never agree — whether it is national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly — no matter what I say — there is a tyrand of insults in social networks calling for an abolition of the elections condemning the policy of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Laborist party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I am admired by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face the escalation of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never give up.
The most disappointing thing in this policy is that such a number of insults has become a norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Leiborist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “extreme church” and with every eighth of mistrust or change in the rules of choice the party is becoming.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling on me to sit quietly and to speak more softly, and then I will be fine.
But I didn't come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a school student, indignant by the disrespectful attitudes of the Government of Tetcher, which caused my school class to literally break apart, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need it most — whether the work of the local deputy or the government minister.
I have never concealed my political views, and I have done so in the past elections.
No one in the Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who have supported this October, I would like to say that our country is moving so hard to Brexit, which will guarantee economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But, in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are leiborists or not: I am proud of what I am serving you, and I promise that no threat of lifting the results of the elections or political feasibility will prevent me from doing what I think is necessary for your interests.

Er 38-17 Melrose: Unsupply Er comes first
Two late attempts, perhaps somewhat distorted the final outcome, but Er undoubtedly deserved triumph in this amazingly interesting Prime League match of Tennant.
They are now headed by a table, the only invincible team of tens.
Eventually, all because of their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Murchi the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad, ” Peter Murchi commented.
Robin Christy, Melrose: "It's worthy of "Er," they've tried better than us."
The attempt by Grant Anderson for 14 minutes, carried out by Freser Climo, led Er forward, but the yellow card issued by the Voriores Scottish player Rory Hugus allowed Melrose to go forward, and Jason Baggot took an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the “Er” break from a fine before, right in the middle of the game, earned a score, and then, in a break, carried out a solitary attempt by making an account of 17-5 in favour of Er.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, and after the re-emergence, Er moved further through the attempt by Stefford McDauel, implemented by Climo.
The active captain Blair McFerson then received a yellow card, and Melroise again forced the rivals to pay the next player for an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colwin, at the end of a violent period of pressure.
Nevertheless, the hosts returned, and when Strauan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the interception of Climo without a penal ball, McFerson made a tachdown behind the coming Ar mole.
Climo had exercised the advantage, not to stop almost since the re-entry, after Kyle Rou had been hit by David Armstrong and had sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the landowners.
Star Still Game is going to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Star Still Game Ford Kyran is going to start work in the hotel industry: it was known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor performs the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script to which he writes, and is filmed with the long-standing comic partner Greg Hemfield.
Duette announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last one in the show, and Kirnan seemed to plan life after Craigagh.
According to official information, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The acter refused to comment on this information, although Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan was planning to participate in the “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgo.
“Our Moore: Bolivia, landlocked, hopes that the Court will reopen her to the Pacific Ocean
Seamen patrol the Navy headquarters at La Paz.
Societal buildings have blue flags.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with a slogan: “Our world is right.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, the landlocked, there is still a living memories of the coastline lost in favour of Chile as a result of the 19th-century massacre of resources; and the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have become the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision to take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a sense of balance and, of course, a positive outcome,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians would observe the decision-making process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal would be able to support Bolivia's statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile was obliged to negotiate a sovereign landlocked Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who has fought a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also looking forward with concern to a decision to be delivered on Monday.
“We are very close to the return to the Pacific Ocean,” he asserted at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not be in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will make little difference.
The United Nations authority in the Netherlands has no authority to manage the Chilean Territory and has already stated that there will be no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice had been delivered only six months after the last arguments had been heard suggests that the case was “not complex”, said Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, Bolivia’s case has not progressed, but it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has been using the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” said Zarata.
She said that the military rhetoric of Morales had destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but there will then be extremely difficult discussions.
These two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court decision was rendered too quickly.
The Monday will bring Bolivia “the exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit”, he argues.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the naval problem as a political goat.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure that we need to pass through our past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be achieved until it can trust the United States
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ry Yong Ho, states that his country will never go to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly meeting.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments are made as Mike Pompeo, Secretary-General of the United States, gradually comes to the path of resumption of impasse nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with Kim Chen Yin, North Korean leader.
Ri claims that the long-term sanctions and objections of the United States to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever be put the North on the knees of a Utopia.
Washington fears the adoption of this declaration unless Pyongyang has previously taken significant steps towards disarmament.
And Kim, and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously regarded as an arsenal, which the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show shows the latest line of massive head baths that promise to come into mass sales, and they'll be carried right next to you.
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
The Valentino and Thom Browne designers presented a number of unusual head coverings, which are part of their collection of SS19 and the blinding visitors of the fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats gained the popularity of subscribers to Instagram, and designers decided to send their snoggly creations to a podium.
A copy of Valentino: a head jewel, ordained with broad margins like feathers, was painted on model heads.
Other massive acessuras included jewelry ornaments, a magic hat, and even ananas, but all these head-dresses are not designed to heal the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fascinating masks, which had to become very predetermined by Halloween.
Many of these peasant masks had their mouths sewed, and they were more like Hannibal Lecturer's portrait than the creator's creator.
One was like a submarine with tube and protective glasses, and one with a growing ice ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge hats have all the chances of getting into mass sales — right to you.
The huge hatches go to the heels of the La Bomba, a straw hat with a two-foot bulk field, which everyone had already put on, from Ryanna to Emily Ratakovski.
The Cultew, which produced this extremely impractical hat that became so popular in social networks, gave birth to and sent out another huge axeswar, a straw beach bag, almost as large as the one dressed in the bather, carrying the bag.
The orange bag of the burned rafia with a white leather handle and a rafia was a brilliant copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris.
“I think big hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sales of the next summer, and since the designer has made such a van by his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge acessuars.”
Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world.
Scotland ' s independent schools continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations demonstrated individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other socially important disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland and are seeking to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for the further attainment of higher education, their chosen careers, as well as the status of the world ' s citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, you call his mind.
If you speak to him in his mother tongue, you turn to his heart."
This is a powerful indication that we cannot rely only on English if we are to build relations with and trust citizens of other countries.
According to recent examinations of this year, we see that the languages hold leadership positions in the league tables and have the highest score of examinations in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of the students received “A” in Mandarin (China language), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent French students and 63 per cent Spanish students were also received “A”.
This proves that, in Scotland independent schools, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital to children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects have the same demand as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the educational programmes of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the British Employment and Training Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the reasons for employers' difficulties in filling jobs were lacking in language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession the student will choose if he learns the second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by gaining another additional skills that he will benefit throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person with a number of foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a 2013 survey by YouGov, which involved over 4,000 British adults, 75 per cent were unable to speak in a foreign language sufficiently to support the conversation, while French was the only bi-value language — 15 per cent of the respondents.
That's why investment in language education is so relevant now.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children more chances of finding a good job.
In Scotland schools there is quite a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own language set.
A number of schools are concentrated in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in the light of the country ' s future development by 2020, such as Mandari or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a choice in independent schools from a number of languages with the teaching staff whose members are specialists in these languages.
The independent schools of Scotland seek to create a educational environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills necessary to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
Currently, language remains vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country, and this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Scotland Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Likers on Sunday in San Diego
The sobering expectation of fans to see Lebron James speak for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Luke Walton, Traner Lakers, announced that James would play a pre-session Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But it is still to be determined how much time it will have to take.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
The reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote in Twitter that James was likely to play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for about six pre-sessional games in Lakers.
“I don’t need pre-session games at this stage of my career to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
West Virginia Trimpa Pre-election Hong Kong, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled meetings of the Trump next week, including the friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate he proposed for the position of supreme judge has been postponed, the Tramp seeks support in the forthcoming intermediate elections, for the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote is taken in November.
How long will the Tempa meeting in West Virginia be held tonight, and how can we view it online?
The Trump meeting in Wiling, West Virginia, will be held today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting with West Virginia voters online on direct YouTube.
The trump would likely be in the hearings that will take place this week in order to put his candidate Brett Kavano to the position of supreme judge, and the proposal by the Trump of the candidacy had caused a number of negative reactions, since Kavano had been accused of sexual harassment and the vote to be taken in the Senate would be postponed for a week while the FBI was investigating.
But the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase the pre-election pace.
Thus, the campaign of President Trump aims to ensure that the five meetings to be held next week “intensify the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, writes Reuters.
“The Congress is so important to his agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, since we enter the tense electoral agitation season,” says Reuters, the Spokesman for the electoral campaign, who refused to be called.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wilinga can attract supporters from “Ogaio and Pennsylvania, and draw the attention of the media Pittsburgh”, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The visit by the Trump of West Virginia on this Saturday is the second visit of this state in the last month, which is where he received more than 40 percent in 2016.
The trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind the results of the surveys.
“This is the fact that Morrisi must come in front of the poll competitors — a bad sign for Morrisi himself,” said Simon Heder, a politicalist from the University of West Virginia (Reuters).
Ryder's Cup 2018: U.S. Assembly demonstrates the willingness to fight and hopes on Sunday for couples' competitions
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game two for two may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The transition initiative is an exceptional concept of sports, but it is believed by the players, and it is particularly strongly expressed in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I suppose it's a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Spit out.
Of course, Europe has four points, and 12 more.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel “the wind in the sails”, and they have reason to keep the spirit at altitude, not least because of the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can be praised by three out of four points.
Sleep was inclined from you to gren, than was a personal example.
The winning voices were getting louder as his round continued, stirring a decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when Thomas and I left two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the 15th moon, was met with a similar voice, one of those who say that he believed in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all our strength and focus only on our own game,” Spit commented.
That's all the players have left.
Go through 18 moons and become winners.
The only players who have earned more points over the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who have undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe beat four out of four, and they seem to know no mistakes.
Muliwood was the only couple who did not take gods on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided blasphemy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series of energy and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the fierce painkillers, strengthens the belief that they will not be won on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the Le Golf National horizon, there will be no more acquaintance of a player who has won the potential victory of Europe than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly crashed with Serhio Garcia, the morning hero of a four-ball game when he was in a pair with Alex Noren.
The gods and the two double gods in the first nine moons had dug the Spanish and led the hole from which they had never been able to get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your hole.
It is so fascinating to observe four balls and four players ' games because of the interaction between couples, the advice they exchange, and who deliberately silence, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has so far played better than a team, and has gone a long way forward on the last day, but this four session has also shown that the US collection has all the forces to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubts.
On the final day, Ryder Cup Europe leads 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup following the conclusion of the Saturday Games of four balls and four with the advantage of 10 to 6 over the United States.
Inspired duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two wins on Tyger Woods to bring the account to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the lost trophies in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the mistake of the American team in the morning games of four balls, winning the 3-1 account.
The United States was more resistant in the Quartet, winning two matches, but they were unable to reduce the account gap.
Jim Ferick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novel who won four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who received the name “Mollywood” after the sensational weekends, became only the second couple that won four points in the first four rounds in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After putting Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then brilliantly joined together to win the spirit of Woods and the American newborn Bryson Dechebmo with even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who passed the two Saturday matches, showed periodically flashing, but now he lost 19 out of 29 balls of four and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested before the morning game of four balls, returned to his partner, Henrik Stenson, in Thursday, winning Dastin Johnson and Brook Kepke, account 2/1 of the first and third seats in the world.
For Europe, games have not become easy and pleasant for a refreshing day south-west of Paris.
The three-fold Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas earned two points on Saturday for Americans as a guide.
They have won a decisive victory with an account of 2/1 over Spaniards John Ram and Ayan Polter in four balls and have returned later to play Potter and Rory Macilroy with 4/3 in the Quartet, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder's Cup was the team left behind four points, leaving alone, given that the Ferica team had to play as hosts to keep the trophies.
However, after two days of holding the second seat, the counterattack on Sunday looks like she's at the limit of their capabilities.
North Korea said that “category” would not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated in the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions reinforced the mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Rie Yon Ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “existent goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear weapons and the obligation not to build stockpiles of nuclear weapons or to develop nuclear technologies.
“We don’t see the same symmetrical reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“No confidence in the United States will be assured of our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able unilaterally to take the lead in disarmament”.
While Ri has reiterated the North Korean complaints of resistance to Washington in a step-by-step approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement appeared important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denucleication without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yun and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the US President-in-Original leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to move towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and the Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea was seeking to formally complete the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for weakening the rigid international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that “there must be denuclearization,” and increases pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal forcefully and even opposes “the announcement of the end of the war,” said Ri.
“The presumption that sanctions can put us on our knees is a Utopian dream of people who do not know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Moon Je-In, which had taken place over the past five months, and added: “If this issue of denuclearization were to be the part of South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri was sharply different from that of the last year when he said in the United Nations General Assembly that the North Korean launching of missiles on the continent of the United States was inevitable after Mr. President of the vicinity Trump called Kim a “self - killer”.
This year, in the United Nations Tramp, which last year threatened “to destroy fully” North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in adopting disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, the Trump said that it did not imply any timetable for the process: “Whether it would take two years, three years or five months is not important”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang to take the steps that have been taken.
However, Mike Pompeo, Secretary-General of the United States, said to the Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and bindingly until we see the complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimityly strengthened the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to discontinue the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the Kuluars of the UN Summit and informed the meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea this year three times, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of the visit, North Korea condemned him for the “bandit requirements”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, for its part, took “appropriate measures”.
According to Kim, the “responsible measures” he referred to were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest at special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all students learn more to sleep and to combat the shovinist culture of uninterrupted consumption of caffeine to keep awake tonight.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he considers to be the first in his history in the United States.
After his opening, he foamed with the idea of introducing such a course, pre-reporting on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘I'm sorry I've learned about it just now that I'm almost done.'
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — what surprised me, ” he told the Telegraph.
The course, first proposed to students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports performance, as well as how it improves the general feeling of the person.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University ' s Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce this course after it was clarified that students had severely lacked sleep during the school week.
It lasts for one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the class offers a picture of a room in a place where students, pressured by coffee cups, curtains, coachers, and books, receive information on how each of these activities and substances — coffee, light that and cause sleep shortages — affect sports results and the importance of getting sufficient sleep on a daily basis.
In another section, participants learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The online map of the Campus encourages participants to think about their everyday lives.
“We understand that these courses will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chasler.
According to him, a false sense of pride that a person can “flee all night” is still prevalent, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that deprivation of sleep is a problem.
According to him, a sufficient amount of good quality sleep is a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, nervous depletion and anxiety, and even to combat overweight, since underdrinking puts his brain into hunger, causing him to suffer a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler to develop a course by attending a class last year during his first year of study in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campaign.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to have a similar curriculum before entering a competitive school.
Professor Chasler recommends that students establish a clock to warn them that they should go to bed and wake up, and that the effects of the blue light, emitted by electronic screens and light-driven lamps that violate human biorist and lead to problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Reingers: Goll Menga wins the Jerard team
Reingers survived another sad visit, as the naked Dolly Manga led Stephen Gerard's unfamiliar team to defeat the 1:0 account in Livingston.
The Aibrox team was hoping to win her first victory after winning at 4:1 in February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt only defeated Gerard of 18 games as managers, leaving his team to eight points behind, giving a light victory to Harts, the leaders of the Scotland Premier League.
Manga was killed seven minutes before the break, and Reingers, who had lost the spirit power, seems to have not been going to balance the account.
While Reingers is now in the sixth place, Livingston has risen to the third place, and only Hibernian has agreed on a ratio of slainheads.
And Reingers may have additional problems after Kalumu Spence, a linear judge, had to heal the wound on his head after an item had been thrown out of the guest sector.
Jerard made eight replacements on the team that went through Er to semifinal for the Scottish League Cube.
In turn, Holt went along with the same Libya 11 strategy, which increased the Harts gap last week, and he would be pleased to see his well-practiced team tightening the opponents at each step.
Reingers may have been driven to own the sword, but Lingston was pushed out much more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to kill a bare in just two minutes when Manga Scott Pittman's first transfer stopped Allan McGregor, but the semi-defense took the chance.
Kigan Jakobs did a fine attack on the captain of Craig Halkette, but his defence partner, Alan Litgou, was able only to send the ball towards the far-reaching trouser.
Reingers overstepped, but the last third seemed to have more hope than to believe in their games.
Alfredo Morelos was sure that he had to strike a fine for forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Loules met, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the Colombian statement.
Reingers had only hit two in the first time, but the former Liam Kelly, Liam Kelly, had hardly been concerned about the blow of Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak blow by Ovi Ejariya.
Although the first naked of Libya, killed at the 34th minute, probably did not match the game, no one can deny that they deserved it exclusively by their own labor.
Again, Reingers failed to cope with Jacob's standard game.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson's ball, trying to pass the ball to Manga for completion.
Gerrard began to act on a break when he changed Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately yielded the result when the extreme semi-protector gave off the pass to Morellos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to drag the guests into the game they intended to play with Litgo and Halkette, constantly making long transfers.
The Hallt team tried to increase the break at the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgou handed over from the corner of the field.
Reingers, Glenn Middlton, once again demanded a punitive strike after he met Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: Heiger's inventor
And now the page of our Almanach, the Sunday morning: 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, a future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Being one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counter has also become one of the foundations of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s Colokola Coronado film, with the cowboylike Roy Rogers and Dale Evans — these seemingly unlike the scientists — in the main roles:
Man: What kind of thing is that?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Here's right now!"
Gance Geiger died in 1945, not only for days before his 63rd.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" anomalic cells
A new anti-aircraft vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" anomalically growing cells and kill them
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalic cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, the cells are given the ability to see the type of protein, characterized by many cancers, and then the cells must be reintroduced
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient whose vaccine was introduced and whose immune system has learned to recognize anomalic cells, the egg cancer has been at the remission stage for over 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins that are common to many types of cancer, and then reintroduce modified cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Wifeda, Maryland, states: “The Results we received are alluding to have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, eggs, lungs, and color cancer.
Similar techniques have been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia, which was to collect immune cells from patients and their “training” as to the effect on cancer cells.
Kanie West defended the Trump in the MAGA cap after his arrival in SNL.
It went bad.
Kanya West was a student at a Saturday concert, at which he spoke in defense of President Donald Trump of the United States, claiming that he would reoccupy this post in 2020.
Following his third song entitled "The City of Ghost", which he had dressed, "We Make America Great Again", the performer delivered a speech against the Democrats and supported the Trump.
"So I often talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support the Tramp, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were to be concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time,' said the evangelizer.
SNL made a parodious show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood Star ridiculed Brett Kavano ' s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Christina Blaise Ford ' s allegations of sexual harassment.
Television did not show how the crowd was upset by West’s comments, but this video recording was downloaded into social networks by Comic Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that he was being ridiculed for his pieces.
"They've been kidding me behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They really fucked me!
Washington Examiner quotes him as saying, "And they also said that my position is not cool."
West continues: “Do you want to know what's wrong with you?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the members of the SNL actor seemed bleak, and one man said to the publication, “The whole studio has been plunged into silence”.
West was invited last time to replace Arian Grande, whose former guy, Reperper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the I Love it song in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Kendis Turner, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the most courageous people: SPACIBO FOR THE MноGOOD SUPPORT”.
The leader of the show Karen Hanter wrote in Twitter that West was simply "the one who he is, and it's perfectly wonderful."
“But I don't want to support anyone (purchase his music, clothing or other support for his creativity) who, in my view, shares and disseminates the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the Reperer announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, claiming that he was now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Deaddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.D.D.
His colleague, Rapper Snup Dog originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, a newly legended performer, Prince, who changed his name in symbol and then in the name of an artist formerly known as Prince (Prince).
Attempted murder as a result of the legacy of Belfast Restaurant
The 45-year-old man was accused of attempting to kill after one of his visitors died of knives injuries in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballihakamore, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Keith Harington's Throne Games Star attackes toxic masky
Keith Harington is known for his role as the waving sword of John Snow in a cruel, medieval fantasy series of HBO “Crown Games”.
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor has strongly criticized the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such characters often impress young people on the idea that to be respected, you have to be cruel.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture Keith said he believed that something went wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masky in the era #MeToo.
Keith, who recently married his co-worker, Rose Leslie, of his peer, confessed that he was “very unevenly uneven” to this problem.
“I personally take this question quite seriously, ‘Where have we been wrong with the perception of courage?' asks the actor.
“Why do we teach adolescents that we have such a problem to date?”
Keith believes that television can be partly blamed in this spark of toxic bravery due to too brawn characters.
The actor continues: “What is inborn and what is acquired?
What does this teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they have to show just one aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change this?
Because today with young people, really, something's wrong.
In his interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any clues or Sikwells of the thrones, after the series ended the next summer, stating that he had “condemned the battalions and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play a major role in Sam Shephard's Resumable West, a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently announced that he believed that the meeting with Rose's wife was the best final for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my life, ” says the actor.
Rose played the Igrit, the object of the enthusiasm of the character of Kit John Snow in a fantastic series awarded to Emmi.
A couple observed a wedding in June 2018 in Leslie's name place in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens who were infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people are ill in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were registered.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, as evidenced by a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV was spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of contaminated blood.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way was almost zero, and Chinese health representatives at the Yunnan provincial conference stated.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission is a serious problem in China ' s LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Research confirms that because of the conservative values of the country, 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual contact with men eventually marry women.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refutes information on the leakage of the senators of the Republican Party, complaining of “dangerous lies” and “theory of conspiracy”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected the charges that one of her staff had posted personal information to three U.S. Senator-Republicans on the Vikipedia of Legislators.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the claims were fake by the “ultivate” experts and websites.
“False, liar and even more liar,” says Woters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the U.S. home addresses and phone numbers of the Senators, Lindsi Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on the Capitolian Hill during the hearings of the Senate Commission on Prosecutions of Sexual Harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano.
The leak occurred some time after three Senators interrogated Kavano.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified by the source was linked to the Waters office, and published information about Woters, reports Hill.
“This unreasonable claim is absolutely false,” assures Waters.
“The number of my personnel whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions has in no way been responsible for leaking this information.
This unreasonable claim is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement promptly led to criticism on the Internet, including by former Spokesman of the White House, Ari Fleacher.
“It is a rage denial, ” writes Flascher.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for work at the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why should you be angry?
You don't need to justify yourself either.
And we shouldn't be digging in the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the Democrats against Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics of being too angry at the hearings on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republicans to be at Waters in the intermediate elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
“If that's true, it's very important,” he writes.
In a statement by Waters, her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent acts.
“We will ensure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and to each of my staff.”
Johnny Ingliss strikes again — a weak pharmaceutical attack on the spy of Rhoen Atkinson.
Today, Brexit is a tradition to look for the meanings of any new film in which Britain is somehow represented; this is also true of the new parodine spy franchise, Agent Johnny Ingels, which started in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film Agent Johnny Ingress: Reboot.
Will a self-earthly picture be with the leitmotive, “obviously, that we are all shits” of a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the omen profane Johnny Ingels with a rubber face has received his right to chaos for the second time — his name is brighter than all that it is a broad-screen comic creation designed for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, is a dumb secret agent who, despite his fascinating claims for glamorous mosquitoes, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's traits and the part of this guy, who made one single note to the London Fire Chariots in 2012 at the Olympiad Opening Ceremony.
Initially, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious “international” Atkinson, who was once in the barclaycard’s forgotten television ad, where the hero left a full chaos behind.
This last issue of JE has one or two nice points.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingish was approaching a helicopter dressed in the middle-century armor, and the snails slammed on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson to physically performing comedious scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strange to surplus, especially because the “serious” movies, such as “Agent 007” and “Missia incomplete”, are now confident to offer comedy as an element.
The feeling that humor is designed for children, not for adults, and for me the fascinating scourges of Johnny Ingels are not as ingenious and appropriate as the Atkinson's fakes in Mr. Bin's movies.
The permanent message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker entered the supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, had an episode.
This is the last drop for the Prime Minister, a humid and violent figure already suffering from a huge political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing all he can to the character of Quasi-Teresa-May, but there's nothing to work with.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy was compromised, she will have to take someone out of the resignation.
And here on the stage is Johnny Ingels himself, who is now a schoolteacher in a pent-institution, but also provides informal lessons of secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, because Ingish offers the skills of the spying Academy in the “years” style.
Ingrish is returning to Whitehol for emergency training and reuniting with his former intriguing friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller this time.
The buff is now a married man who is under the commander of the submarine, the role of the “весy hokkee bloods” in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they're faced with a beautiful rocky woman, Ophelia Bulletova, in the execution of Olga Kurillenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously exposed to the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, Jason Volta, who is played by Jake Lacey.
Ingisch and Buff begin their odysse of farsse jokes: frozen under waitresses, they ignite a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves into a luxurious Volta yachte; Ingish produces a perfect anarchy, trying to use a virtual reality garbage to get acquainted with the Volt home interior.
All these scenes are, of course, a nice and embarrassing fiction, but there's something very childish about that.
Full of moderate things.
And, as with other movies, Johnny Ingels, I couldn't help thinking, can the British movie industry give Rhoen Atkins the role, really commensurate with his talent?
Leiborists deny that they are developing a plan to reduce the British working week to four days in five days' wages
The Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, is about to consider a radical plan whereby the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The Party is said to want company managers to give savings to employees as a result of the revolution in artificial intelligence, providing them with additional weekends.
This would enable staff members to enjoy three days of weekends for the same wage.
Sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” in the party's economic agenda and would help the population to take sides with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
The high-level source of the Laborist Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen at once, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing balances in the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party”.
The Leiborist Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the majority of the Laborist party is currently not supported by this aspiration.
The representative of the Laiborist Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party”.
Teneum Chancellor John McDonnell used the Leiborist conference last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to break the power of the “loose directors” and “speculants” of public firms.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water can not recover their entire share, as the Leiborist Government can make “exemptions” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and the establishment of Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector firm capital to workers who could receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell the “60 minutes” if the FBI investigation against Kavano can change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano held a final vote on his appointment as High Judge for at least a week and asked whether the findings of the Agency could encourage any of the Republic senators to support the Kavano.
In an interview shown on Sunday, Scott Pellie, correspondent for 60 minutes, took an interview with Senator-republicans John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their views.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course, ” Kennedy replied.
“ When I went to the meeting, I said that I was talking to a judge of Kavano.
I called him after this information came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
His response was decisive, determined and unambiguous.”
But Grem's opinion remained intact in the vote.
“I have made a firm determination about Brett Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by force, comparable to the dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is that Brett strongly denied all of this,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
“None of those she called as witnesses was also unable to confirm these facts.
That story has been 36 years old.
And I have not noticed anything new in it."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
On this Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual musical event involving an impressive star composition with an astonishing mission — the end of poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year, as many as tens of thousands of people have been leaping into the large grassland of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performance of such performers as Janet Jackson, Kardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to describe the present objective of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of Peace Citizens, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of the global project on poverty alleviated by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for an event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you have to participate in volunteering or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or do any other or other significant action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Society of the World ' s Citizens in 12 years been in achieving its goal?
Is the idea of remunerating people by being able to convince citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “cultivism” when people believe that they are making real changes by signing online music or sending messages in Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers state that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” carried out by its supporters have been registered at the festival, with many different objectives.
It is recalled that, as a result of these actions, world leaders pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that had been made as a result of its actions, at least 10 billion dollars of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important commitments is the The Power of Nutrition: the British Partnership of Investors and Empowered Specialists to “Assist children to fully develop their capacities”, has promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, which has been done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the participants in the Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national Governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices with regard to the undernutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 interventions calling on Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced the funding of the “Food Force” project, which would cover 5 million women and children through nutritional activities.
In response to one of the often asked questions on the festival website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizens respond: “It will be a long and difficult path on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wikend, Sean Mendes, Kardi B, Jeanel Mone, here are some of the artists who will attend this year's event in New York and who will be the leading Deborr Lai Ferness and Hughe Jackman.
The United States is able to use the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports: the Minister of the Interior
The U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could “as necessary” seek the assistance of its navy to prevent Russian energy transfers to markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a pretext for new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are some ways and means to deal with this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the seaways and, if necessary, the blockade to prevent their energies from entering the market,” said the Minister.
Zinke addressed the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that stands as the U.S. energy consumer's voice.
He further compares Washington ' s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is a more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” says the Minister, calling Russia “a ponies with one trick, whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
Statements were made that the Trump Administration had set the task of increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper version for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump Administration, including the U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of the North Flow-2 pipeline, which, according to Trampa, made Berlin the “happer” of Moscow.
In Moscow, several times, it was stressed that the North Flow-2 project, valued at $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's violent resistance to the project is due to economic causes and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said the Minister of Energy of Russia, Alexander Novak, following a meeting with the U.S. Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has given rise to a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, in the face of the German Industry Federation (BDI), encouraged the United States to keep away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When the third State intervenes in our supply of energy, this poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of the Chancellor of Germany, Angels Mercel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The Massachusetts Senator, Elizabeth Warren, will examine carefully the possibilities for presidential balloting in 2020
The Senator from Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren, said on Saturday, that he would carefully explore the possibility of presidential balloting after the intervening elections.
At a City Duma meeting in Holioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the electoral race.
“It's time for women to go to Washington and reconstruct our broken government, and for that, a woman needs it,” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I shall consider carefully the possibility of presidential balloting”.
Warren appreciated the work of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “Take this district in the wrong direction”.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy before the bones' brain,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Tramp and his candidate for the position of Chief Justice Brett Kavano.
In its Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we proceed to vote.”
However, the survey, published on Thursday, showed that most of the voters of Warren themselves do not think they should be balloted in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Saffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts ' “like” voters stated that the senator should not be balloted.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other famous names of democrats discussed in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Baiden claims that he will make a formal decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told me about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Paylina at a meeting with the electors of Donald Tramp.
Trek Paylin, 26 years old, took up military service in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now suffering the same as those of other families who have suffered the consequences of PTSD and who have been wounded, and our soldiers are returning to wounds,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talls, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest a “bloom on the eye” and said of her son and other veterans of war: “They are returning to others, inclined, asking whether the same respect is shown to their companions, soldiers, pilots and any other military force they have shown to their country.”
Trak Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of family violence against the woman by intruding in the situation of violence and possession of weapons of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, Colombia, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Colombia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts provided on Friday in Washington with an analytical note by the court consultant on the support of the asylum-seeker challenged the policy.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August is not disclosed against federal policy.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons in a criminal group” had subjected her to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace indicate that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have submitted a large number of applications for asylum in the United States as countries facing widespread problems of criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the decision taken by the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without documents to escape domestic violence.
The Attorney-General of Colombia, Carl Rasin, in his statement on Friday, stated that the new policy “is ignoring the decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Law requires that all applications for asylum be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and that prohibition violates this principle,” states the report of the judicial consultant.
Counsel also argues that the policy prohibiting the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens that is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, the Attorney-General, Jeff Sashnes, ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims of domestic or banditry violence.
“The refuge will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” said Saesn in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to address completely all the problems, even the most serious ones that people face every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: the number of deaths doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly difficult.
“It is now very difficult, ” says Rice Kusum's 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick child at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, quick help brings the wounded.
Clear water in a large shortage.”
The residents return to their destroyed homes, digging in wet things and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and 7.5 hospitals affected by the earthquake were overloaded.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a spine and shoulder transfusion, rested at the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients were treated in open air because they were forced to leave the premises because of continued strong impulses.
He cries, remembering the severe earthquake that destroyed the number in the hotel on the fifth floor, which he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think that I was stuck in the wall’s blasts, ” says Haris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife crying out for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are saved, and now they are all right."
United States Ambassador accuses China of “inheritance” through “promotional advertising”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page advertising in the United States and China daily, the United States Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the fee supplement of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper issue in the state of Iowa, in charge of China in an attempt to intervene in the U.S. Congress elections held on 6 November, which China denied.
The Proclamation of the Trampa that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. elections is evidence of the fact that US officials reported to Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington's growing pressure campaign on China.
While for foreign Governments it is the norm to place advertising for trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of the trade war, resulting in the equation of tariffs for imports of their countries.
China ' s counterfeiting tariffs at the beginning of the trade war had the task of impressing exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Tramp Party, Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador in China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter in China, argued that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and business.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Des Moines Register in Sunday, “now doubles this digestion by posting propaganda in our own free press.”
“In disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese Government enjoys our dear American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and advertising in Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“Only in the newspaper quios, here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear the different voices and see the true diversity of the views the Chinese might know about China’s alarming economic policies, since the local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China, ” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had been “too baptized” from the proposal to publish its article, although it had not given the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Republican dispersal of Kavano is pushing women voters away before the intermediate period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain side-sided and defend the candidature of Supreme Justice Brett Kavano, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative response, especially on the part of women, which may affect the upcoming intermediate elections.
Emotions around this situation were ravaged to extremes, and most Republicans officially stated that they wanted to continue the voting.
Such things cannot be returned afterward, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of political science at Maxwell School at Siracus University, in his Saturday article.
Rier doubts that attempts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI in the last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, and they will not forget it tomorrow or November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre on Friday, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group of MoveOn, Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters scanded “November ahead!” against the Senate, when the Republicans supervising the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavano, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, reported Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scope,” stated Stue Rotenberg, a non-party politician on the news site.
“ People say that the situation has already collapsed, and that’s true.
But it can be worse, especially in terms of women voters in suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29 years, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the high judge in accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts had assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the movement, this step could lead to a response.
“It is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the past week, reports NBC News.
“It is not only a matter of voting in the committee or a final vote, or whether Kavano sat on the bench of defendants, but also of how the republicans deal with it as they relate to it,” said Gay Cesil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select democrats, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have slightly split up on the question of whose beliefs are that Ford or Kavano, and are slightly more inclined towards the latter.
The new YouGov survey shows that 41 per cent of respondents are accurate or likely to believe Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they believe exactly or most likely Cavano.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano was likely to lie or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to FBI, FBI is currently investigating the charges put forward by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week Ford vowed to witness to the Senate Legal Committee that Kavano had attacked her when she was 17 years old when she was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the high judge showed her his genitals at a party during the Yale University in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web inventor is planning to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lie, the inventor of the World Wide Web, runs a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid enables users to choose where to store their data and to give access to what information.
In an exceptional interview by Fast Company Berners-Li, it was the wish of Inrupt to gain world domination.
“We have to do this now,” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to build their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as calendar, music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify -- everything can be used in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by the user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal empowerment through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the Inrupt idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and skills to make Solid available to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners Lie, Brussels, security platform, purchased IBM, several state developers contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer programmer community.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lie said that he and his team weren't negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make major changes that would make all their business models completely different at once.
“We will not ask their permission.”
In his Saturday medium post, Berners-Li wrote that “the Inrupt Mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Li converted the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the Berners-Li vote was quite influential in the debate on neutrality on the network.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet, ” says Berners Lie.
Bernard Vann: a church servant awarded by Victoria cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one war priest was awarded the cross of Victoria during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellengliz and Lowkour.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military reward.
The commemoration was solemnly opened by his two grandchildren at the Ruschden parade, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic ” that the monument had been opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received the prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann conducted his battalion through the St. Kanten Canal “in a very dense fog and under the heavy fire of field weapons and machine guns”.
Later, he threw himself on the line of fire and led the group forward with the greatest courage, and then with one hand threw the field gun, killing the three soldiers of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wangn, 72-year-old grandson of hero, said that “he wouldn't be able to do the same heroically, but it's humiliating.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a vein at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great privilege for him to take part in the parade” and added that “the plausibility of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people.”
The MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they were given a peppe pig.
Imagine you haven't slept all night to see full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 fights, including six main programme fights, which were broadcast all night in direct air on 5 British television channels.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British fans were shocked to see the Spring Peppa screens.
Some inmates were not impressed by this, for they had not slept until the morning just to see the battles.
One of the Twitter fans called this change of broadcasting to a child's cartoon “a sick joke”.
“It was decided by the State that this content was inappropriate for six o'clock in the morning, so they had to switch to child programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice-President of Bellator on Marketing and Communications when he was asked why it happened.
"Yes, Peppe's Lead."
President Bellator Scott Coker said that they planned to make a schedule in such a way that in the future fights could also be seen by British spectators.
“As regards redisplay, I think we can solve this issue,” says Koker.
“But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we're not going to be able to settle this issue until Sunday our time, and it's gonna be Monday for them.
But we'll do the best.
Believe when the news was changed, a bunch of text messages came down, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, thought it was a technical failure.
It turned out not to be a matter of public importance.
I promise that this will not happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that quantity, but we're going to have to go through.
Yes, it has been wrong.’
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inappropriate because of his sexual orientation.
The Olympic Davier Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than anyone because of his sexuality, but that's what motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete told me that he did not realize that “not everyone like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first programme of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, held by Lauren Lavern, he said that he spoke of the rights of gays to give others hope.
He also said that his victory in Olympics began to disturb him less after he had a child.
Kirty Young, a permanent multi-year leader, took leave for a few months because of his illness.
Daley, who was the chief guest in Laverna's programme, said that he felt “more neat than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and for girls.”
He relates: “To this day, these feelings of negligence and inappropriateness were quite real, but they gave me strength, and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he meant something, not to disappoint all when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The twofold Bronze Olympic Medalist became a well-known LGBT activist and, in his statement to the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he had been able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
The threefold world champion said that his feelings for a man, the American director, Dastinu Lance Bleck, whom he met in 2013, “has caught him out of the way.”
Last year, Daley married Oscar's laureate, which was 20 years older, but claimed that the difference of age was never a problem.
“If there is so much in your life in this young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a peer who would have the same very opposite experience.
A couple became parents in June, and they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that “the whole world's perception” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I don't need to win a gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know, there are things and more important than the golden Olympic medals.
My Olympics gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept his death, and one of his last requests was to be tickets for London 2012.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you're not going to be there, and you can't sit there in the first row, ” says Daley.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible, ” says the athlete.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won Bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in front of a crowd of fellow citizens in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling, ” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for Olympics and still enjoys him so much.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikelson, not in uniform, held this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
The American Phil Mikelson will set the record on Sunday, playing his 47th match of the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to pull up the shape to avoid a bad mileage.
Mikelson, who played at the binnal in the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürik on the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-fold large winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in anticipation of what he was concerned about.
Never had the most direct stroke, even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf National rifle, where a long ruff usually punishes for inaccurate blows.
And if the course isn't scary enough on its own, Mikelson will meet the exact British Open Molinari champion on Sunday with the new tourist Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in 12 single matches make a fair start, Mikelson's match might be decisive.
Ferick expressed confidence in his partner, although what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role entrusted to him today, twisted me on his back, hugped me, and said that tomorrow would be ready,” he commented.
“He's pretty sure of himself.
He's a grace Hall, and he's done so much for these teams last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's the way it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all."
On Sunday, Mikelson will beat Nick Foldo's record by the number of matches in Ryder's Cup.
This can mark the end of a career in Ryder's Cup, which never corresponded to his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven others, although Ferik said that his presence brought great benefits to the team.
“He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to design people, and he's a great guy with whom he's interested,” he explained.
“ I think this week young players had fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a great advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, in his own experience knows that a significant solitary leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavourable side.
Danish debuted in a match in 1997 in Walderram, where a team headed by Severjano Ballesteros had five points over the Americans, but had overwhelmed the finish line just a little ahead of the smallest difference, winning with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but only so far”, said Bjorn, who had been sealed in a photograph, after watching the class in 2018, won the Le Golf National field with 5-3 account both on Friday and yesterday, which resulted in a 10-6 account.
So the story will prove to me and the whole team that this isn't over.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do it right.
Until the scores are put on, nothing's over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophies, and that's what we need to focus on.
I told you not to be silent, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that we are against the greatest players in the world.”
Enjoying the way his players spoke on a frustrating golf field for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have exceeded myself.
We'll have another test tomorrow.
Individual speech begins tomorrow, and this is a different matter.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you're feeling all your strengths as a professional golfist.
That is the idea that players need to be inspired to put themselves in full tomorrow.
The partner is now behind it and must also make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferick, believes that his individual players will be better off than their partners, except Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who's got three points out of four.
Ferick himself went through all of this carousel of the last days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing Europe when he spent the Medina Crude.
“I remember every damn word about this,” he said in reply to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had united his players before the last day.
“We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish all of this quickly, like in Brooklyn, like in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts great pressure on the middle of the match.
We set up our plan for a game accordingly and set up the kids as we thought it was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to create a miracle.”
Tomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Makilroy at a top-master with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players at the top of the tournament table.
“I have chosen this group of guys, and in this order, because I believe that they will thus close up all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said by commenting on his choice of individual players.
Resumption of new German military ship in operation
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be operational in 2014 to replace the oldest military ships of the Cold War, but this will not take place at least next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the lavino price growth, local media report.
Introducing the Reinland-Pfalz operation of the main ship of Baden-Württemberg, which is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The ship had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since delivery had made the fate of an ambitious project more difficult.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the older Bremen fregates.
It is well known that they will have a powerful gun, a number of airborne and anti-corruption missiles, as well as some “stels” technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signaturs.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods — the possibility of deploying the latest fregates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the continuous delay in the deployment of ships means that the most modern military ships, which are said to allow Germany to distribute its power abroad, are already obsolete by the time they are armed, notes Die Zeit.
The frigged F125 was in the news headers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ships in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned to the ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects” that made the military ship use use use use use useless.
The software shortages were particularly critical, as Baden-Wurtemberg vessels would be exploited by a crew of about 120 seafarers — only half of the labour force in old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy to reduce its productivity and limit the ability of the IMF to introduce updates in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton “Rainland-Pfalz” is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to malfunctioning equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached an impressive €3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of retention of the newest fregates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
Previously this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, recognized that the naval forces had virtually “consumed stocks of ships capable of deployment”.
The ruler said that the problem had become worse over time because the old ships had been removed from operation, but no vessels had been replaced.
He said that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregats could be taken into arms by a fleet.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of flying mice
A new study carried out in one of the sites of the Scotland Hill has the task of showing how volatile mouses use the landscape in search of food.
It was to be hoped that the data received would allow a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and would help in further conservation activities.
The study of the Scotland National Fund will explore common natopics, soprano natopics, and the brown long-wheeled long-wheeling mice and Dobanton nights in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registries will be installed at some locations to monitor the operation of volatile mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the area using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screaming as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their conduct on the scale of the landscape.
Rob Duar, NTS Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for volatile mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of life management, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forests, the best for volatile mice and other related species.
The use of volatile mice in Scotland and throughout Britain has declined considerably in the last century.
They are at risk of disappearance because of construction and denial work that affect their habitat and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities may be dangerous, as well as a fly band, chemical processing of construction materials and the hunting of cats.
In fact, the bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to fishing.
They use complex echo-location techniques to determine precisely the obstacles to the flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of volatile mice.
There are ten trained experts in the organization who regularly conduct surveys, exit checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only reserves of volatile mice in Scotland in Threave in Dumphris and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish volatile mice live.
The real estate manager David Thompson says that the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, is a great place for flying mice," he says.
“There are old buildings here, many old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But a lot of things about flying mouses remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for well-being.”
It recalls the importance of checking the existence of volatile mice before maintenance within private ownership, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young persons, perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice is protected by law, their destruction, the digestion or destruction of their habitat is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland Officer of the Flying Mice Conservation Fund, calls on the public to help.
She says: “We still have much to learn about our flying mouses, and we simply do not know how many species live.”
Ronaldou denies rape charges and his lawyers are going to file a German journal with a court.
Krishtian Ronaldou rejects the charges against him of rape, calling them “fetch news”, and claiming that people are simply“willing to be pedagogical”, using his name.
His lawyers are going to bring to court the German news magazine Spigel, which published the charges against a football player.
Forvard of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American on behalf of Catherine Mayorga, which was allegedly in Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday to Spiegel.
In the Instagram video, in which a 142 million subscribers, a few hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldou, 33, referred to this information as “faying news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they told today is all the fairy news, says the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They just want to be pissed with my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, saying my name, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy person, and I'm fine," adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to submit to the court for the charges they called “unreachable information on suspicion of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Scherz stated that the player intended to seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the hotel number Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
When Ronaldu and Mayorga met at the night club, they allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to the documents before the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga argues that after the alleged incident, Ronaldou fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent good guy but fell by one percent”.
The papers claim that Ronaldou confirmed that a couple had sex, but that was mutually agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “fear that she would be revenge” and feared “public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence as she continued to experience traumatic feelings resulting from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Real Madrid of Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian Yuve giants in a transaction of Euro100 million.
Brexit: Great Britain will “regret for permanently lost autoproducers”
The Minister for Business and Enterprise of Greg Clark stated that Great Britain would “regret on it forever” if Brexit lost its status as world leader in car production.
He also commented on information that Toyota UK had informed BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without transaction, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the consequences of delays on the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could result in job loss.
The Construction in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about withdrawing from the EU without an agreement on international trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to autoproducers, if there is no Brexit supply chain transaction, the supply chain will be at high risk.
The Toyota production line shall be launched “due at a time” and the details for cars manufactured for orders shall be provided by the British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain withdraws from the EU on 29 March without transaction, there may be a boundary failures which industry said might cause delays and shortages.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks in its factory in Derbishire for more than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that the plan of Teresa May, as expressed in Chekers, on future relations with the EU was “preciously calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, again, not only to succeed now but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said in the BBC program “Today”.
“Not only Toyota but other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify for which time the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the leader of the factory trade union, says that the concerns of the members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose those jobs, we will not be able to return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House information.
The responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney-General, Rod Rosenstein, may be “transmitted for another week”, as the struggle for Brett Kavano ' s candidacy to the position of Chief Justice continues, stated the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser, Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's interference in the elections, the relationship between the Trump's assistants and Russia and the potential barriers to justice by the President.
Whether the Deputy Attorney-General's Tramp had been dismissed, thus threatening Mueller's independence, in Washington for many months had been controversial.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire for recording talks with the Trump and the possibility of impisting the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denounces this information.
On the last Monday, however, he returned to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
The Tramp said that he “preferred not” to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid collision with the Senate Judicial Committee, at which Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blaise Ford, testified.
On Friday, the Trump ordered a weekly investigation into the complaints of the FBI in Kavano, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Spokesman for Tramp, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court”.
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not conducted briefings in the White House since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of briefings was not due to “a contempt for the community” of television reporters, although she added: “I will not deny that they are playing publicly”.
She suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press should be increased.
“The President has more meetings to respond to journalists than any other President before him,” she added, without citing, however, the exact figures: “We have these numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me”.
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, this is a decent replacement for press briffes.”
The tram regularly responds to questions from the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking persons.
The conference is rare for the press at all.
Frivolous and sometimes strange behavior of the President before the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer why it is.
The Minister of Health is writing to EU employees in Scotland about the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed the EU staff working in Scottish GSO to express its gratitude to the whole country and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, MSP, requested this letter to the staff members less than six months before the British departure from the EU.
The Scotland Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of status declarations for EU nationals working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “In the summer of the negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit, the expected solution should be made.
However, the British Government also strengthens the preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know that this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Collectives from all the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your house, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercromebi undertook an emergency operation with regard to head injury
Michael the Authority from Tennessee reported that the semi-defense of Tennessee Tigers Christian Abercromebi had undergone an emergency operation, having suffered head injuries on Saturday after the 31 to 27th in the Wanderbilt Commodores match.
The head coach of Tennessee Rod Reed stated to the journalists that the trauma was received shortly before the break.
“ He went to the side line and just broke down there, ” said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromebi oxygen on the side line before putting it on the wearers and taking medical examinations.
The state official of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Neshville, Tennessee, that Abercromebi had an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the type/steps of trauma is available” and Tennessee seeks to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercromebi, who had only entered the second course, it was the first season of Tennessee Steit, after moving from the state of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully grabbed five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher herb fee for the purchase of real estate in Britain.
In accordance with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher herb fees for the purchase of real estate in Britain and additional funds will be used to assist the homeless.
This step will result in the attempts of Corbin to attract young voters
Higher herb fees will be charged to those who do not pay the tax in Britain
Treasury expects it to collect up to 120 million pounds per year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher leakage for the purchase of real estate in Britain, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless — this will be announced today by Teresa May.
This will lead to the failure of Corbin ' s attempts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to raise the income of citizens.
The increase in herbal collection would be levied on individuals and firms not taxing in Britain, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The allowance for existing herb fees, including the increase imposed two years ago for secondary housing and rental housing, could be up to three per cent.
Treasury expects that this step will provide up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate is not purchased by British residents, which has resulted in higher prices and complicating the task of buyers who acquire their first housing to improve their housing conditions.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing, spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction of herbal assembly to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction firms of jeopardizing real estate prices by acquiring land but not actually using them, and called on Ms. May to renounce the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the “sustainable housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include control over rent and end unfounded evictions.
He also wished to empower local governments to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “ last year I said that I had dedicated my premiere to fulfilling the British dreams to make life better with every new generation.
This, among other things, means solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it is unfair that for people who are not citizens of Britain as well as for foreign companies, real estate is as accessible as employment-loving British.
For too many, the dream of acquiring a home has become too distant, and the threat of being on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
The boss of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, says that his “final goal” is to become a Scotland manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the rebirth of the north-east club, which is currently the third largest in the first league, separated from the first three points.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after he returned St. Mirren to the Scottish Prize League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I've got a B cap, and everybody," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching my father and Scotland as a child in Hampden, and this always attracted me back.
But only if I am able to be a successful club manager will this be possible.”
The predecessors of Ross, the directors of Sunderland were also Dika Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gas Poyet and Paulo Dy Kanio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says he didn't feel trembled before such authoritative names in such large clubs, previously renounced Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“To me, success at this time will depend on how I can return to the Prime League club.
In its structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly a premier League,” says the coach.
“To get him there is a challenge, but I will take it that I have done my job only if I can return the club.”
Ross is only three years in office as supervisor, first becoming an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Hearts Coach Headquarters.
He then helped Alloa rise from the third level and in the next season brought St. Mirren out of the lower position to the winners of the championship.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his game career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crosshair,” he recalls his responsible work in Alloa.
“ I sincerely believed that the manager was better than the game.
It sounds weird, because I did everything well, I earned a good job and made some progress.
But the game is more complicated.
There's a lot of things that need to be done weekly.
I still feel stressful at work, but I feel good at managerial positions.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, in doing so, I feel the most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”

According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for pints of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pabs, but reduced sales in restaurant networks.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants dropped by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistics, relates: “Intense solar activity and longer than expected, England’s participation in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when the sales in pubs grew by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.”
The June decline in earnings in restaurant commerce was also continued by 1.8 per cent in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food were also affected by the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people want to jump outside just to miss a glass.
The sale of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent per month and food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for leisure and hotel business, says: “These results continue to tend to be seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of major social or sporting activities remain critical factors in the market market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to be difficult, especially since sales drops by 4.8 per cent in annual calculations will be particularly painful due to continued price pressures.
The long hot summer has proved to be more than ever for food operators and is not yet the fact that August, by bringing more moderate temperatures, will give the necessary rest.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of brands.
Industry sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the British Pubs, bars and restaurants are collecting and analysing the productivity of 47 networks, with a total of over 9 billion pounds of sterlings, and is a recognized sectoral reference.
Each fifth child has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, every fifth child — some only 11 years of age — has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools revealed an increase in the pages of the Fellow Inst.
This news has reinforced fears of sexual content
Twenty per cent of the students said they had a “core” account known to their parents
However, 1 out of 5 children — some only 11 years old — create social accounts that they hide from adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of instability foe accounts, i.e. the Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news raised concerns about publications of sexual content.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a basic, “clean” account to which their parents had access but also had secret accounts.
One mother, who had accidentally gained access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, encountered a teenager who urged others to “against him”.
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Directors of Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social profiles, half of which admitted that one of them was generally secret.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan says: “Many adolescents are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is an alarming fact.”
Ailed Doyle will become the voice of Scottish light athletic athletes
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Ailed Doyle was elected to the board of directors of Scottish light athletics as an observer member of the board of the Director.
Doyle is the most solemn Scotland athlete on light athletics, and President Ian Betty argues that this is a great opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of the extensive international experience of athletes in the past decade.
“Aylyd enjoys great respect in the Scotland, British and the world light athletic community, and we are confident that its participation will bring great benefits to a light athletics in Scotland,” says Betty.
Doyle says: “I'm trying to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and promote sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 m at Atlanta 1996 Games, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and is now working as a row commentator on BBC, after the stroke has lost its ability to walk.
He writes in his Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would show me if I was going to get better, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I was completely cured, I learned to walk again, and today I do my skill!
Thank you so much for your support!"
The Milk Soup Advertising, in which mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The Milk Oxygen Manufacturing Company has raised disputes on the Internet, publishing an advertisement where feeding mothers are compared to dominant cows.
By producing the market, “the world’s first cheese-free milk-to-mobile that can be carried on the chest, ” Elvie has published an advertising music video showing the freedom that the new milkboat provides to feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a full hay under a musical track, saying, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you will not see my tail" and, "If you didn't notice it, it's my breast."
Then the choir said, “We follow, we follow, we feed our babies with breast milk, we follow, we follow.”
This advertisement that was published on the Facebook page has caused disputes on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video has received a mixed reaction from the audience, and many say it sheds light on the breast industry.
“It's a bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, except for their children to be taken away within a few days of birth,” writes one user.
Molokootosos Elvie is dressed directly under a special busthalter (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise the milk cubs for mothers who leave their children?"
Another user adds: “Reklama, separated from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “very beautiful. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed a baby, I'd certainly buy one.
The breast feeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is, of course, a little crazy, but that's exactly how it feels.
A generic product, ” wrote one user.
And another comment: “The adorable ad on the mothers who feed their breasts (often they do it directly in their jobs or in the toilet) and who, indeed, feel a little "cows."
This advertisement is not to praise or scourge our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women shows that they were all dancing with these unseen milk utilities hidden under the busthalters.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milkboats are totally unreasonable, have no wires or tubes, are freely placed in the busthalter for feeding, and are unrecognized to enable women to move, hold children, and even walk outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood specialist of Mother, commented: “Molocotossos Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves courageous and provocative advertising.
Conversely, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing an incredible and cheerful sense of freedom that gives the new milk oxen.
It's not the first time that Elvie's milkboy gets in the news headers.
During the London week of fashion, the mother of two children appeared on the designer's chip of Marta Yakubowski, using the product as assigned.
Hundreds of migrant children moved unhinderedly to the tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings of the border remained relatively constant, partly because the rhetoric and the policies imposed by the Trump Administration made it difficult to place children with the sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by taking the child under the supervision of the child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking Immigration and Customs Officer, witnessed in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to be sponsored by the remaining minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been tried before.
“Around 80 per cent of persons who are either sponsors or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
We therefore continue to prosecute these persons,” said Olbens.
According to the shelter workers, in order to accelerate the process of children's education, officials had introduced new rules that required some of them to be brought before a court within a month of detention, not 60 days later.
In order to state their legal status to the immigration judge, many are present on videos rather than on their own.
Those who are considered not entitled to assistance will be deported quickly.
As reported by shelter workers and information in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the greater the likelihood that they have a cause of anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornilo, where the signs of a child's difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them already struggle with.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Mualem, also called on the Syrian refugees to return home without seeing the eighth year of war in the country.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of counter-terrorism, and “will be treated accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the gatherings.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over.”
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly trained and consulted by both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Asad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in a war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return and accused the “some Western countries” of “dissemination of irrational insurance”, which had led refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They politicize what must be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union caution that Syria will not be assisted in reconstruction until a political agreement on the cessation of war is reached between Asaad and the opposition.
The UN Diplomatics say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large harbour of the insurgents of Idlib provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian Turkish Agreement prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia against a province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “due time frames” and hoped that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants associated with the Al-Qaida front of Nusra, who would be “destructed”.
UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will soon be convened, comprising representatives of the Government and the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
Mualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in that committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “constitutional consideration” and cautioned against interference.
Why the Temple will win the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump would win the re-election in 2020 if the impistence and the scandal would not prematurely complete his presidency, which is probably the hope of many liberal audiences.
And that will certainly be “the most dramatic end of the presidency in all history!”
At present, there is no sign of tireful viewers.
Since 2014, the ratings of the Prime Times have grown more than twice, to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primm audiences, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded the cable channel ratings by collecting 3.5 million spectators at evenings during the show of the main news.
“This is a fire to which people are drawn because it is outside of our understanding,” says Neil Bar, director of the ABC Drama Designed Survivor, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes President after the Capitol is destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skowell, a long-standing comedian writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about entering the Hollywood boy club,” suggests another theory.
She recalls one day going to a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
'Why?' she asked.
He said, "Yeah, because he's funny!"
In all of this chaos there is something valuable is fun.
Of course, as opposed to all other content broadcast on television, Washington's video lines can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
The exception is a luxury that only the most privileged audiences can afford.
Yet, when you're six hours in a row, watch the group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodwood's "deep Background" for his book "Strah," or the Pol Manafort jacket of $15,000 from the ostrich skin (a humiliated haughty," says "Washington Post"), or the sharp description of Stormi Daniels, say so, Mr. Trampa's anatomy is already beyond the normal awareness.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same eyes, for instance.
“It's his job to make us feel that the realist show is that he feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, the executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Pawn Stars creator about the changing actorial composition of the Trump show and the daily turns of the story (draca from N.F.L., the glorification of Kim Chen Yina).
You can't afford to miss any episode, or you're hopelessly back off.
When I contacted Mr. Flaces this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north coast of Kauai, the sun shone, but he hid inside his house and watched MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not escape the screen, at least not when he showed how Brett Kavano appeared before the Legal Committee of the Senate and decided the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy show, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of western civilization,' says Mr. Flace.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outsiders' money is poured into the worst intermediate elections leading the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash flows as a result of the change in districts in Congress, in which two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long ago, supports a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who took place in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, the Republican of Kit Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersected with the new 17th.
The maps were reviewed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January had ruled that the old areas had been in violation of the Constitution as a result of the election.
The Hong Kong in the New 17th District gave rise to a fervent discussion on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the March special elections to Congress in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Tramp has won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts have given democracies a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for China's support, but then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had caused a negative reaction to Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with President Khuan Carlos Varela, President, and was also in Panama until the Trump management team was evicted.
The representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “the recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan”, stated at the beginning of this month by the Spokesperson of the Department of Hezer Naurt.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visas restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country, with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
In the background of regular internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, followed by a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, high-ranking representatives of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to proceed, and had actually discontinued the consideration of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be presented by Vice-President Mike Pens as a sign that the Administration attaches real importance to the meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without taking any new stringent messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the outside analyst, which is similar to that of the administration, but also speaks on anonymous terms.
Learn History
The next step may be to report to the Special Adviser, Robert Muller, on the possible impediment to Mr. Tramp of justice, which is now very significant evidence in public reports.
Mr. Muller is also reportedly inquiring into the facts of the conspiracy of the Tempa campaign with Russia and its attack during the past elections.
If Congress changes the master, Mr. Tramp will face the responsibility of the body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury among his colleagues.
But there are many “ifles”; I do not want to say that the fall of Mr. Tramp is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to erect a coup and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened if the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We did not, however, and thus missed the possibility of avoiding the next years of bloodshed.
The course of history is on such points, and the unrelenting march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are experiencing some of these breakthroughs now.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump dismissed Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Muller's destiny?
Rosenstein was in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he had proposed secret records of the President ' s activities last year and had reasoned on his inappropriateness to his position.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that The Times data are not correct.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavano is not complete or true, or if it is still upheld to the position of supreme judge in spite of credible accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in the medium term for the Congress, which will bring Mr. Tempa to account?
If we do not go through these trials well, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can walk them decently because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish woman who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied an embassy house, where I lived many years later.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she spent me igniting Saturday candles on a table with a swastic symbol.
With such a family past, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Reingers is optimistic in the face of collision with the Vienna Rapid soccer club.
Reingers accept the Vienna Repaid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, following an impressive nomadic in Spain over Villarréal at the beginning of this month, will enable them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe group.
The knee trauma hindered Gram Dorrance's semi-professioner to speak for the first time in the season with an account of 2:2 vs. Villarréal, but he believes that Reingers can use the result as a temple to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us, because Villareal was a good team,” said a 31-year-old soccerist.
“We went into the game, believing we could get something, and we left with nothing.
Perhaps we could eventually be able to deal with it, but, in general, nothing could have been a just result.
They were probably better at the first time, and our success came to a second time where we had shown ourselves better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a complicated game, because they've shown a good outcome in their last game, but given the support of the inmates, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive outcome.
The past year has definitely been difficult, given all my trauma and replacements in the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully acquaintance, and the kids are really enjoying it; training has been done in the Ur.
I hope we will be able to move forward, to leave the past season and to succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of their pension accumulations
Although the interviewers had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed the value of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 per cent said that they spoke to their children on the subject.
“People want them to be cared for by a family member, but they are not trying to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of Nation around the world on life insurance.
That's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not express your desires in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and your family, where and how you will receive medical assistance, as this choice may be an important factor in spending.
Consult with your financial consultant: it will help you to develop a payment plan for these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care policy or a mixed monetary insurance policy that will help cover these costs or insure yourself by means of your own property, provided you have money.
Get your legal documents ordered: get rid of the legal battalions.
Suppose medical trust and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of financial trust.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your accounts if you are incapable of doing so.
Think of the small things: Imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to provide information on the medicines he takes and the allergies he has?
Write down all these details on the paper so as to prepare for each case.
Martin adds: “The choice of doctors is essential not only the availability of finance, but also the choice of doctors.”
“ What drugs do you take?
Who will take care of your dog?
Introduce and write down this plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people died as a result of a major earthquake and tsunami attacking the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to increase.
As a result of the withdrawal of communications, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Dongal, a region north of Palu, near the earthquake episcenter with a force of 7.5 points.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulavesi Province, located at the end of the narrow covet on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with the estimated population of 379,800 (dated for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a circuit extending 300 kilometres [180 km] of the coastline in the north-west of the island of Sulawisi.
The district, administrative area less than the province, was 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the Central Sulavesi province, and in particular the Dongal coastal region.
Nickel production is also important for the provincial economy, but largely concentrated in Moralov, on the opposite coast of Sulawisi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years, the tsunami has been devastated several times in Palu and Dongal.
In 1938, tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of Dongal homes.
Tsunami also occurred in western Dongal in 1996, resulting in the death of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The heavy earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis, which struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Strong earthquakes occurred at the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake by force 6.8 perished south of Yava, the most populated island of Indonesia, calling the tsunami on the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of the magnetud 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points occurred on one of the islands of Mantawa in Sumatra, calling tsunamis up to 10 m, which destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The severe earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district in Aceh, calling for destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake of 2004 and the tsunami.
This time no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombo, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily under ruins.
Sarah Paylin's older son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Paylin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice candidate of President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charge of the attack.
The 29-year-old Paylin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intruding in the situation of domestic violence, and for resistance to arrest, according to a report issued on Saturday by the police of Alaska State.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in the Mat-Su detention facility and will be released under a bail of $500.
He appeared before the court on the Sabbath, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “single innocence”.
Paylin is threatened by three minor offences of Class A, which means that he may be deprived of liberty for up to one year and fined by $250,000.
He is also charged with a crime of Class B punishable by imprisonment for a period of up to one day and a fine of US$2,000.
This was not the first time that criminal charges were filed against Peilin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of family violence and possession of weapons of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016, after explaining the misconduct of her son's post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake caused a tsunami of 7.5 points and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake took place near the central Sulavasi, which is north-east of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The social networks have videotapes of an accident.
Hundreds of people were on a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
The Federal Procurator ' s Office wishes to impose a rare death sentence on the suspect in New York
The Federal Procurator ' s Office in New York seeks the death penalty for Sifullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist attack in New York, which killed eight people, a rare penalty for a federal crime that had not been applied in the State since 1953.
In October, Saipov, for 30 years, allegedly took the home Depot truck to attack a bicycle track on the West Sid highway in Lower Manhattan, whiping pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight persons and “intentionally inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the intention to achieve the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York.
According to a judicial document, the two charges may have resulted in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the large federal jurisprudence read out Saipov ' s conviction with 22 counts of charges, which included eight murder charges for a requit normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “unreasonably planned and deliberate”, Saip has implemented it, as described, in “abusive, cruel and criminal manner”.
“Sipullo Habibullayevich Saipov suffered injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laura Dekadta, Darren Dreik, Ariael Erliya, Ernana Ferrody, Ernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukko”, states the notification of intentions.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have elapsed since the prosecutor demanded the death penalty in the Southern New York district for the criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death penalty in the federal case in New York was applied to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, a couple who had been executed for a conspiracy in favour of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi were executed using the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov ' s judicial documents, the Uzbek promulgated a lack of repentance after the attack.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was glad he had done so.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to see the IGIL video on the phone to commit the attack.
He also asked the IGIL flag to be hanged in his hospital room, and the police reported.
He denies his guilt for all 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on Saipou's side, said that they were “unreasonably disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to impose the death penalty, not life imprisonment without release, will only exacerbate the pain of those events for all participants,” said Patton.
The protection of Saipov had previously applied to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of Parliament from Tori said that NAJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
The former Ukip leader said that the policies should “sense” the euroskeptics, as one of the members of the Parliament of Teresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, a conservative party member at the Birmingham meeting, said that Britain would be “upon” if Mr. Faraz was Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deep-separated ranks is exacerbated by the fact that members of the Tori party opposed the withdrawal from the EU join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister is striving to maintain his compromise plan, which was expressed in Chekers in the midst of attacks by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to enter into a deal with Brussels, despite negative reactions, and thus make Euroskeptics and lieborists choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Boun said at the meeting Leave Means Leave in Solikhalle, he wants to play Chekers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraja be leveled and held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
“ If he had been responsible, we would have gone, ” he said.
Wellingboro added, "I will continue to advocate Brexit, but we need to play Chekers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their views and wanted to remain completely inconsistent with the reality”.
Brexit party party Brexit, Andrea Jenkins, was also at the meeting, giving journalists a comment: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“The Chekers are not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, and he is also unpopulated among the members of our party and our activists, who are actually jogging the streets and who first choose us.
"Please put Chekers back and begin to listen to what you are told."
In her sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies were to make a decision taken at the 2016 referendum, they needed to be forced to “hear the filament”.
“This is now the question of confidence between us, human beings, and our political class,” he says.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, "We will not let it go."
Turning to an alarmed crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is at the verge of the betrayal of Brexit, to feel fiery.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has won us to Brexit, and we will not calm down until we become independent, independent and proud United Kingdom”.
In the meantime, Brexit’s opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham, then held a two-hour meeting at the center of the city.
Several activists wore the Tori v Brexit posters on these weekends.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, member of the Leiborist Party, criticized conservatives because of security problems in their mobile annex.
“And these people claim to be able to set up the IT systems and technology of Canada plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one complete fare.
There is no good Brexit in principle," he claims.
Warren plans to “examine carefully” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
Member of the U.S. Parliament, the Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would “examine the possibility of presidential balloting”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told on Saturday about her future at the West Massachusetts meeting.
Warren, the frequent critic of President Donald Trampa, is being re-elected in November to re-election against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
They're talking about her chances of taking Trump's post in 2020.
On Saturday in Holioka, she had held a regular meeting with the voters; since Trump had entered the post, it had already been her 36th meeting with the voters in the format of the Ruth.
One participant asked her if she planned to stand for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to reconstruct our broken government, and that would require a woman upstairs.”
As a result of the killing of Sims (incarnated), the LSU player was arrested
The Baton Rouge police, Luiziana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder (rail) of a basketballist LSU Wade Sims, who took place on Friday, had been arrested.
At 11 a.m. in English, at a press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video shooting to help identify the person who was able to be filmed on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot at the Southern University on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims has been shot with a gunshot in the head after which he died”, said on Saturday to journalists, Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he had participated in the incident, had arms and shot at Wade Syms.
When Simpson was arrested, he did not resist and was detained at the East Bayon Rouge District Police Department.
The young man grew up to 1 m 82 cm in Bathon Rouge, played 32 start-up games in the last season, and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 suits for the game.
Gran to Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Feter
Since Waltter Bottas had been qualified on Saturday, cheating on Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' command tactics would play a major role in the race.
From the Poul Possishn Bottas had a good start and almost hanged on Hamilton when he defended his position at the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pie-step, leaving Hamilton to splash in the tail of the whole group -- the choice that had become decisive.
The Mercedes left one circle afterwards and left behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some battle of the wheel wheel, flew forward, causing the driver Ferrari to reluctantly leave the inner space free, risking being trapped after a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstaphen started from the back of the grid and was at the seventh place by the end of the first circle.
He then led most of the race, holding his tires on his tyres, with a view to finishing quickly, whispering Kim Rakeconen to the fourth place.
As a result, he left on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight circles, as Rakeconen took the fourth place.
The day seemed difficult because Waltter had done fantastic work for the weekends and had a real grace by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of stocktaking tricks," said Hamilton.
Traitorian Sign Language
President Donald Tramp criticized Senator Daenne Finstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her allegation that she did not promulgate a letter from Christina Blaise Ford, the accused of Bretta Cavano, a candidate for the position of Supreme Justice, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in Western Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, saying that what happened in the Senate showed that the participants of the events were “false, disgusting and lying people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what has taken place in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, is anger, anger, disgustingness, disgustingness and falsehood,” he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Did you get the information?
Remember her answer... you've "saw" the document information?
Oh, no.
I didn't sweat.
Okay, stop.
We didn't slip, he added with the intonation of the senator.
In July, Finstein sent a letter detailing the charges made by Ford v. Kavano, and in early September it was illegally promulgated, but Fainstein denied that the leakage occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not confuse her information,” declared Fainstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of leaking seems to be disapproved by the President, who commented on this during the Saturday meeting: “This is what I will tell you: the body’s language has made her awesome.
Maybe she didn't slip, but the tongue of the body was the worst I've ever seen."
By continuing to protect his candidate for the position of Supreme Judge, whose three women had been accused of sexual harassment, the President had suggested that democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“They definitely try to restore power in all available ways.
We have seen the filth, the disgusting, the indignant, the insults they're going to hurt, through whom they should pass over, in order to gain power and control,” quotes the Mediaite words of the President.

Jayants received an early two-headed advantage as a result of Patrick Duaier and Francis Bovilleer's blows.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Duyer led Jayants as leaders.
François Buchar compared the Dandi account before two naked Lucas Lundwald Nilsen stabilized their victory.
For the people of Adam Kifa, who had won Dandy at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was a third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties in the season when Jayants won three previous matches.
The first naked of Douayer was at 3:35 a.m. after Kendall McFall's bare paste with the support of David Rutherford, after which Bovilleer doubled four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markvardt assisted Koni in the reconciliation of the account at 15:16.
Duyer was assured that Jayants had intercepted the initiative during the first break when he killed the second head in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts were regrouped, and Bucharus again leveled the account, killing the head at 27:37.
Koni and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nilsen give Dandy the first opportunity to gain leadership at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, won the victory by holding the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.

Aviadispertcher died for hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air detector was put to death after his deliberate death in order to enable the aircraft with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of the severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, which caused the tsunami.
Strong underground pushes continue to destroy the area, and many residents of the city of Palu are under the siege of buildings.
Despite the fact that his colleagues escaped to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the terrifyingly hot airport high of Mutiara Sís Al-Jufri, the city of Palu.
He remained in his place to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft, which was then on a landing strip, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he felt that the tower was falling off, he jumped from it.
Later he died at the hospital.
The Indonesian aeronautical representative Johannes Sirait stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to get him to a large hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, the manager died before the helicopter got to Palo.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of casualties resulting from the earthquake may be thousands, as, according to disaster management agencies, access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still under debris, and many have never been able to get out of there, ” said the representative of the Sutopo Puru Nugroho.
The waves of which were six feet [6 m] high devastated the city of Pala, where the mass graves of the dead would pass on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, relates to Sky News: “Speaking aid brings the victims every minute.
There's no clean water.
The mini-marketes are all over the world looted."
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, relates to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help survivors, but we do not know that they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
President Joco Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Pala on Sunday and addressed the armed forces of the country, inter alia, saying: “I request you all to work day and night to carry out all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? ”
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now reports that one person disappeared after the crash of the plane in the lagoon
Aviacoma, who had been hit by a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reported that one person had disappeared, while it had previously been said that all 47 passengers and the crew had safely left the towing aircraft.
Air Niugini states that as of Saturday, she has no information about one male passenger.
Aviacoma stated that she cooperated with local authorities, hospitals and the police in trying to find that person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more information on the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local sailors helped to save other passengers and a plane team after he fell on the water, trying to land at the Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The causes of air accidents and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses argue that the plane was unable to land on the airstrip.
American passenger, Bill Janes, says that the plane began to go down on the airstrip too low.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janice told me that he and other passengers were able to get to an accidental exit on a drowning plane because the level of water was on the belt.
He also told me that the stewardesss were panicking and yelling on board, and that he had a light head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that seafarers repairing the jar nearby also helped to save by using a boat on which they were shipping people to the shore before the aircraft was loaded up to about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Flight Safety Network data show that over the past two decades, 111 people have been killed in air accidents with companies registered in PNG, but none of these have been involved in Air Niugini.
An intelligence analyst has been able to prove the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution instituted a case against the man accused of burning the Mississippi residents in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roolett gave a long-term testimony as an expert witness in the area of intelligence analysis.
He told the departmental members how he used mobile phone records to provide a common picture of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jesse Chambers victim the night she died.
Roolett reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that night, which was contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his mobile phone was close to Chambers; when this was found, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford whether Tellis was truthful, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Neshville.”
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he had met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to the telephone records, they only convened for one week.
Roolett also showed that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis had removed her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life, ” says Hail.
The defence should begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.

Another black one?
New York nanny brought to court a family couple because of racist texts
The New York Nanny brought to court a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny had been “one more black”, which the woman had wrongly sent to the nurse instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that a claim is filed with a “health of extortion”.
Lensi Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern that the new nurse proposed by the Child Care Service, Gisel Moris, was black when she came to her family for her first working day in 2016.
“NOTHER THIS, THIS THIS THIS, ONE HERNY, ” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexsman in her husband's text.
However, instead of sending a text to her husband, she twice mistakenly sent it to Ms. Maurice.
Aware of her deficiency, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, claiming in the service that a nanny who was afro-American had done a bad job, and that they were expecting a Philippine rather than an African American, reports New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now submits to the court for a family couple and demands compensation for dismissal of $350 per day for six months, under the original oral agreement, which, however, was not established by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said, “Post” on Friday, adding, “And I know it's discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism and claim that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since, if they hurt her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her in a report what she did not mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, post.
"Would you trust your children to someone you were rude with, even if you were tired, who didn't want to?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!'
Plasco said that his wife had born a child just two months ago and had been in a “every difficult situation”.
"And are you ready to persecute the man in this situation?
It's not very nice for you," he added, a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already rendered its sentence in social networks, indicting a couple of inadmissible behaviour and logic problems.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand the course with the bear speaking, said the new letter
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Janquel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, responded to the letter: “It is difficult to put himself in the place of the first reader before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he had decided to write a child book on the bear, was an operator for BBC and would have responded to the denial of publication with optimism, and added that the 60-year anniversary of his publication was “happy and bitter” since the author had not been published last year.
With regard to the Paddington bear itself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained knowledge.
“He was a quiet and modest man, ” says his daughter.
“Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child were successful; he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think that's how he felt about the success of Paddington.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.”
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After a plane was landed, her daughter was taken to the hospital of Nizza Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors futilely tried to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said that everything was really bad that something went wrong,” relates Mrs. Ednan Laperus.
“Then he called again and said she would die in the next two minutes, and we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashy, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that the doctors gave her, causing her heart to work, gradually ceased to operate, leaving her body.
She died before she was expected.
I had to just sit and wait, knowing that everything's coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, shout or cry, because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to keep myself firmly in my hands."
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperusa, mourning the loss of her daughter, sat on an airplane with other passengers, reconciling the enormous loss she had just had to survive.
“No one around me knew what had happened, ” she says.
“ My head shook, I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this pervasive feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are putting postcards on the Walsh bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers for which people can seek support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and when he was 18, he killed himself.
“ I don’t want other parents to feel the same as I do every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, living in Lydney, says that her son was a great cook and had a damn charming smile.
“ Everybody liked his smile.
Everybody said that when he smiled, the room seemed to be lighting."
But before he died, he left his job because he was experiencing a truly terrifying time.”
That happened in 2014, and Tyler, who killed him, found his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I'm still afraid that it's going to be a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis invented these cards, “that people might know that there is someone to whom you can turn and tell everything, even if that's your friend.
You can't sit and keep quiet, you need to talk to people."
Mrs. Humphriz, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who had lived with 15 years of age, who was not soon after his mother’s death.
“He didn't say he felt depressed, upset or something in that kind,” she says.
“ A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
It was especially bad for him at Christmas, and he did not even look at the children when they opened their gifts."
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must pass through it, this event shocked our family.
It ripped it apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

The future of Bretta Kavano is hanging on the hair: the FBI is starting to investigate
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked us to do, an investigation limited by time and volume, we could bring at least a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was “dissolved” in the background of a growing chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The intermediate elections will be held only five weeks later, on 6 November, and if, as expected, everything is bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the Senators by lobbying the support of Mr. Kavano, who has since worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who worked at that time as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which is currently composed of 51 republicans and 49 democrats.
To date, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Penz to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his nomination for the position of the Supreme Judge.
The number of North Korean winners decreased with Kim
Since Kim Chen Yen came to power seven years ago, the North Korean leopards in South Korea have declined, claiming a South Korean legislator.
Pack Bohn Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared with 2,706 flights recorded in 2011, the figure last year had been reduced to 1127 cases.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher rates imposed by smugglers exporting people, had been key factors.
The Pyongyang has no public comment.
South Korea ' s citizenship is ultimately proposed for the vast majority of North Korean winners.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regards the winners as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, two leaders met in Phenyang to resume the impasse for nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jung Yun in Singapore, at which they reached general arrangements for the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Yun Ho, accused the United States of being hampered by their sanctions.
“If we do not have at least the least confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavano “external” and claims that he is not worthy of work before the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the position of Supreme Judge, “external”, and said that he was unpleasant because of his temperament to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help but think that if a woman ever acted like that, she would immediately be called a “expression,” says Pelosi about her reaction to the Cavano testimony at the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's allegations of sexual harassment that occurred when both were still adolescents.
Kavano spoke emotionally enough, and at times he even shouted and choked about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Committee ' s democrats, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and well-planned murder of a person” organized by liberalas, frustrated by the failure of Hillari Clinton to the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kavano merely confirmed that it was not possible to serve in the Supreme Court because it was biased against democrats.
“I think that he disqualifies himself with his claims, as well as the way he attacks Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
The peloss were grieved when she was asked whether she would try to hold Kavano accountable if his fault was confirmed and if the democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say, ‘ Unless he speaks the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court at which he is present,' said Pelosi.
Cavano is currently a judge of the D.C District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of the Kavano with regard to the Law on Accessible Medical Services or “Row v. Wade”, as he was considered to be a conservative justice representative.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavano was a party to the question of whether it would cancel some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now it is not time to let the hysterical and biased man go to the office of supreme judge and say, ‘ How wonderful!’ ”
And women have to do that.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of anger; it cannot pass through it without tears.
“ When we get angry, we cry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 later.
“I don't think it's so unusual, as you think?”
She went on to say, "I've been very helpful to a woman who worked somewhere at the office, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger partly because they are misleading.
One of my most painful memories of the first job in the office where men dominated me was that one day I was crying out of rage, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a ruthless manager, whom I always feared, and pulled out on a staircase cell.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
They do not know that you are crying for evil.
They think that you are upset, and they rejoice in the thought that they have finally proved you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on a slight intrigue and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason for her to run for the presidency.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates had already participated in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case "Bellownage and seven Dwarves".
The campaign was nearing its end, and it was very slow in the collection of funds, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race if she didn't collect $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only offered her 250.
“I'm what for them, the valued goods, or what?” she wondered.
When she spoke, declaring that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the feelings of gratitude to the people who supported her, the frustration of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as the rage of sexual discrimination that she suffocated.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Ms. Schroeder about the way the press reacted to it.
"Maybe I think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I still wondered what they would write on my monument.
"She was crying for no end"?
How trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first set of trade wars between the United States and China has been deaf, and although the battle is far from completion, the divisions between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The largest escalation took place this week when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds) by actually taxing half of all United States revenues from China.
Beijing has had an equivalent retaliatory impact, recently setting US$60 billion worth of between 5 and 10 per cent.
China promised that the response to the United States would be equivalent every time, and the second largest economy of peace would not be likely to face at least the slightest difficulties in the near future.
Forcing Washington to retreat means abstaining from demands, but publicly abstaining from the United States would be too disgraceful for the President of China, Ci Jingpin.
However, experts believe that, if Beijing is able to produce its maps correctly, the pressure of the United States trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a short-term political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic hurdles in any of these countries, in fact, is much more dangerous than previously recognized by observers,” says Abigail Grayce, a researcher of the Analytical New American Security Centre (Center for New American Security) specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of refugees
Syria states that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance in the reconstruction of the country that has been devastated by the war of over seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Mualem, reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and safe because of the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rebuild the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists to enable people to live there in peace.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for helping to rebuild the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that the country would not receive assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Consolidates the Reider Cube in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, winning the U.S. team with a total of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The European Reider Cup has been lost six consecutive times on European land, and the European Reider Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who had won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who strenuously fought most of the tournament, took his first long-range blow in the water on the 16th berth of par-3, stepping back to his Frenchsco Molinari match.
Italian Golfist Molinari defeated in all of his rounds, becoming 1x-4 players who ever went 5-0-0, since the current tournament format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit hit a 5.4 player with the lowest ranking in the European team, Turbjörn Olesen in Denmark.
One of the world’s best players, Dastin Johnson, gave up 2.1 Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Hispanic Serhio García, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has won the tournament in Europe with 25.5 points for a career.
“ I don’t cry at all, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I've been able to help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's handing the torch to his fellow countryman John Ramou, who won the American golf legend by Tyger Woods on Sunday with the count of 2:1 in the solitary game.
“I feel incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching the game of Tiger Woods, ” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the record of his career is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 main titles, only withdrew to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. assembly fought all weekends, futilely trying to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the highest grade golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fürik said, after an uncomfortable statement by his team: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to slightly crack Europe.
It didn't work.
We're taking off the hats to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played great.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Ryder Cup, and we will move forward in order to succeed.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We have lost."

The recent Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission report reflects a general decline in the concentration of red tide in some parts of the Tampa Gulf region.
According to FWC, in Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, a large number of flowers indicate a decline in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tile extends approximately 130 miles of the coastline from the northern Pinell to the southern districts of Li.
Hours can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough, but as compared to the past week, their number has declined considerably.
The Red Tide is also observed in Pasco district.
The average concentration in and near Pinellas district was reported last week, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasot districts and coastal zones, average concentrations in Charlotte district, high concentrations on the coast of the Li district, and low concentrations in Collier district.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts, there is still the likelihood of irritating breathing paths.
In northwestern Florida, no such probabilities were reported last week.
