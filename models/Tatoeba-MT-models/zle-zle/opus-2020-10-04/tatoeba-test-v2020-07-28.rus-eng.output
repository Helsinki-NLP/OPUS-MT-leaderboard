I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of dogs.
The party was full of girls.
I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
How did you make an impression on Tom?
Why does he hate me?
Stop teasing him.
He knows her from high school.
Tom looked like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
The accident almost cost him his life.
He chopped the bottle.
We're home now.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you don't get me wrong.
Why are you so mysterious?
You just run away from life's problems.
Outside the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting for you for three hours.
I failed the examination.
Eat as hot as that.
So I had to wait three hours.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Mary was an idiot.
I told him to wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come too.
Last week I hit Boston on Tom.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked cooking.
I told him you were busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
Do you want anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what Tom should do?
I can't just ignore him.
She's going to school on a bicycle.
I'll pay now!
You want to drive?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're peers.
A coin rolled up under the table.
She's empty.
Wash the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
The fiftieth camel caravans were moving unseafully in the desert.
You should be ashamed of your own ignorance.
I changed with Tom.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom would hardly lose.
Tom said Mary wanted to drink.
What are you kidding about?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get around.
Didn't I tell you I had allergies on peanuts?
I know how old you are.
I won't show him anymore.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to disappoint Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He's coming to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to strangle Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win again.
Astronauts wear vaults.
Algeria purchases artillery from Russia.
Should I tell you what happened?
I have nothing to give you.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
It's empty in this room.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
We're in Germany!
We were sleeping under the open sky.
Don't lock the door.
When are you free?
Isn't Tom supposed to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
The humour is one of five feelings.
What do you got?
They're afraid of him.
Tom's at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you made a name for a newborn?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got a cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I still go to Ukraine.
I made you breakfast.
I didn't think you'd let me do it.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The humpback grave will fix it.
Soup's so hot it's impossible to eat.
Why is it so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where'd you get so hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is unpleasant.
Father's in the garden right now.
Harry works part-time at the local supermarket.
It's very unlikely that I'm gonna be late.
I told them to be in hats.
Tom said he was really tired.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning on breaking up with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom locked the door in his bedroom.
I knew Tom for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom is very good at the violin.
Nobody blames you.
The next year is the year the Rabbit.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What have you learned?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last strokes.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have books.
Tennis is the only sport Tom knows well.
Come to the fire.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember I love you.
He's said to be a murderer.
Mary didn't want to wear Halloween's frank suit, so she decided to dress like a woman-amish.
Tom picked up his hat.
Tom waited three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have children.
I'm not gonna be like that anymore.
I go shopping every morning.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom to go anywhere without me.
I watched you do.
He's got great math skills.
Careful, on the roadbone.
He's a new marriage father.
The men were then men.
The Swiss banks are very secret.
Once you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you think.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom's gonna say when he finds out?
Christmas is nearing.
Do you want us to do this together?
All our attempts were empty.
He poured another glass to himself.
Please, please, I'm going to go to the patient's audition now and make sure you've traced the correctness of this procedure, you'll have to turn to the use of it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the barn.
You'll ruin your eyes.
Tom was high for his age.
Did you notice Mary's earrings?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie genre?
So I didn't have to ask me twice.
You need to go to Boston.
I jumped out of joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I don't see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many deficiencies in his plan.
It's the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
On your face, you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a ruined plate.
I can't let him go alone.
It's Tom's window broken.
By allowing the demons to enter the flock of pigs, Jesus demonstrated the steadfastness of God’s Law on Unclean Animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we'll be fine.
We had to come.
I was wrong about it.
It's my birthday today.
We need to tell people what to do.
If she's inexpensive, I'll buy her.
I told you what I had to do.
She almost drowned.
That was a good movie.
Are you a leak?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom forbids me to talk to you.
Who were you going to sell it?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave me the will of anger.
The missing boy was identified on his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it was like.
She likely refuses to follow his counsel because she does not like it.
Did you write that?
I know you're working for them.
I hope I can help you.
Are your parents aware of this?
The waitress put a white scooter on the table.
That day, I stayed home because it was raining.
Is there a pharmacy nearby?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why does Tom look at me like that?
I called the police and said my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
It helps a bit.
Cats in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak frankly?
I work for the oil company.
Why don't you find someone who needs your help?
Tom put a wet towel in Mary's forehead.
He hurt his left hand.
She's Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city is declining every year.
Dan didn't want to look shy.
Can you tell me something about yourself?
Did you find the difference between these two pictures?
I've never seen so many books assembled in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
Cats have a wool tongue.
I'd never do that.
Reform it, please.
We need to put a ice bag in the calf to reduce the wreck.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't have to apologize, you didn't do anything wrong.
Take another cookie.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom's in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here tonight.
"Who are you national?" "Argentines."
Why are you sad?
I can do it much better than you do.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The umbrella's broken.
Tom brought his room down.
Did you complain?
I don't really love Tom.
So we have to change our plans.
Someone bit him.
Do you want to know anything else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before he left.
But I don't have any money.
How's Mary's new dress?
Fear was on his face.
If you don't tell her, I'll tell her.
Can you trust a secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Should we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
You're the one to blame.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Make her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Smell it.
Tom arouses deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do that.
I hope I'll see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There are no girls on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why it happened.
We'll send them a card.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look left and right, before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm really upset.
As often as it is, Mike's late for a meeting this afternoon.
Tom told me Mary had a new guy.
We don't let that happen.
These fools have violated the law prohibiting a violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John said so loud I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to Tom.
Strange rumors are coming.
I know you're rich.
Bill's put a hundred dollars on his trip.
He served in the Navy.
Who taught you how to dance?
Tom wrinkled his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not lying.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not gonna screw up.
He's in the car and he's gone.
Tell him about everything that happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do my homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We don't know the side effects of this drug yet.
Tom has been in pain for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies the last.
It's a girl who came in yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You said it was yours.
Where did he get these shoes?
Don't make me do that.
What was your smile?
Tom's usually going to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are team partners.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more often every time I see her.
Is that how I think?
Everyone except Tom has hats.
She gives him anything he won't ask.
Is that sold?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have that much?
That's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only exacerbates the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of the barrel in the toilet.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're gone.
Can I take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jesse stood there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's a little sugar in the packet.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something very good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't go to other people's business.
Who's in the blue T-shirt?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have money to buy a dictionary.
Why are you so surprised?
Carrots are good for the eye.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself for marriage.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom's bathed.
It's half a third now.
The lion's strong.
I had to make sure he'd come here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the hat.
Maybe we should take a walk.
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of cats.
I heard you play banjo well.
Did you read them?
I told him I wouldn't help him.
Tom regrets leaving Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom's awful French speaking.
I don't remember how much I paid for this.
Don't you sing with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I'm barely on a train.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fantastic movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to go upstairs.
His house is behind the hill.
It was Sunday, and I didn't get up early.
How many pens!
Mary, are you a good look now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom made 20 retracts.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave Tom a stove, threw a glass of wine through him, and a firm step came out of the restaurant, a dead silence arose.
You're two years younger than Tom.
We learned them.
Tom's gonna paint the fence tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary alone.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes Tom.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him for a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom could swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone is interested in Japan.
Tom's very easy to get out of here.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I don't agree with him.
That's what luck is.
It was so dark in the room that I had to get through my eyeballs.
How many air carriers in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Sleep again, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom knows he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in winter pots.
I speak French.
If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where you found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why are everyone watching me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so weird.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you awake?
Get the garbage out.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you buy a candle?
Canada is the home of hokkey on the ice.
The brain is a very complicated organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese is good.
The thief has crossed the window.
Spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss without a moustache, like a salt-free soup.
You tried to talk to him?
Where are the other prisoners?
So much has happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired of death.
Do you know what your children are doing now?
You want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Tom kept chirping her.
Six goes in front of the family.
I went to my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone wanted to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who ate from a garbage tank last night.
I think Tom lied to me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Mary stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his finger.
Did you sign the contract?
I told him he should talk to the lawyer.
What, did they take the wrong bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of friends.
This area has changed completely.
Tom is an anti-Semit.
What is your strongest side?
Tom doesn't like to be pushed.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbas sang a song on Neclayev's words, could she have imagined he'd be balloted to the presidents?
There's yogurt in the refrigerator.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom always speaks frankly.
The Thomas's got to be there by 230.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he was extremely exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why don't you look for him?
They survived despite the destruction of the building.
I wouldn't want anything better.
Tom wants popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned down.
John is not careful, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's that guy?
Keep the kids away from the pond.
We'll talk about it tonight.
I have to fix this.
They don't know French.
Relax!
I knew what Jacksons were doing.
You shouldn't apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one grandson and three grandchildren.
He wants peanut oil.
You're so lucky.
Tom's starting to drink a little bit.
I barely understood him.
He escaped the bait.
You can live in a big house and still don't feel comfortable.
I'm waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red's better.
The universe is infinite.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a word?
Don't make a noise like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We eat at six.
The deer was the victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom is a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to persuade her to help us.
Are you with us?
Make a wish.
Tom's alive.
It can lie in the water for ten years, but it won't be a crocodile.
Tom pretended he didn't understand what Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw it happen.
I think there can be no other reason than this.
I'm very happy right now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How can you always be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What ego!
So you bought it?
A man is as old as he feels, and a woman is how much she looks at.
Wisdom comes with age.
Do you remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He tried to cross the river.
Everything seems to be happy.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want a daughter yet?
I like walking along the river.
You can quite come with me.
This dictionary is a great gift to us.
"How long before dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary's been spending all her time at work.
Tom got on his motorcycle and took him.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I waited for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing that comes to his mind.
Why do you want to leave?
How's French gonna be "bye-bye"?
It wasn't that expensive.
What do you have with your computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not gonna fire you.
You really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend that big money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that every week of the world disappears in one language.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we'd talked about it.
How sad my parents would be if I had failed.
I'm feeding a cat every day in the morning and in the evening.
Hold your tongue, you don't get it.
You have to take into account all the consequences before you make any changes to the existing code.
I can't bite, I don't have teeth.
I think you did a great job.
Last night we had heavy rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I damaged my nude.
I don't have anything else to say about him.
What other choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come home early, Bill.
She was sitting on her chair and reading the magazine.
It's forbidden to cry from now on.
If I knew it, I'd tell you.
That's where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the monkey.
Don't even think about it!
Beautified in white, the house seems bigger.
I have difficulty finding the original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What is the point of doing so?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give Tom more time.
You haven't told me what Tom says in French.
Tom's coming back to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a film on French with English subtitles.
I'll have lunch.
I think Tom was good at playing.
He only blames others, he never blames himself.
Do you know how to play banjo?
Tom came up to Mary and hug her.
"When do you come back?" "All depends on the weather."
How many turtles live?
How safe is this?
Your message has been received.
My house was completed for three years.
I was annoyed.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to be at his party.
I suddenly realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Are your parents still living in Germany?
I need it today.
Tom is likely to win.
What would you like Dead Moros to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where is your adventure seeker's spirit?
Why were you angry with me?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his people to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done it yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's engaged with my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, think like a man, act like a lady, look like a girl and work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
That sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in my hat.
Put it on the box.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles traveling on this road.
You deceived us all.
I don't think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
To pretend that you make me believe that I believe in what you do not believe.
I think that would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was pardoned.
I appreciate your support.
Do you think that's possible?
He got sick to finish everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, I don't think he knew you.
I refuse to help Tom.
Can I sit with her?
Leave it to yourself.
Are you reading anything but the Bible?
Please read me the report from the boiler.
What does this gentleman do for his life?
Why do you think Too likes it?
Do your parents know that?
Are they talking about you?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoeb is not to say a thought above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four dollars.
Because of the strike, I had to cancel my trip.
I don't know your name.
How long a train is coming to Boston?
What are the words to this song?
Mary likes to tease her brother.
The law's on my side.
So we had to find where to live.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was engraved on the date of the professor's birth.
You got your phone a few times while you were in the shower.
She came out for him because of the money.
Not any bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just a superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
Account, please.
Your shoes must always be clean.
You've got a birthday soon.
Count it.
I don't like those shoes.
Tom had been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I've downloaded on the Internet.
I think that's less than thirty.
Did you drink?
Clearly, he is best suited for this work.
You're facilitating my work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I love you.
It doesn't look like you're very busy.
Deadline's gone.
You look a lot like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom left the room without saying a word to anyone.
That probably didn't happen.
Have you finished lunch yet?
Tom and Mary spoke at least an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He was trying to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How many tie do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the last rumors?
I'd show you how it's done.
I begged Tom to come.
You've got a giggle.
My mother taught me not to waste money for nothing.
We could walk.
She died yesterday afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took a seat for me.
I wanted to talk about it.
I yelled for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know it's important to you.
They all knew her.
We better stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm awfully hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's taking care of horses.
Why don't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
Usually people die if they're killed.
They cut Tom off the lifesaving apparatus.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
Excuse me for my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary have a lot in common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't fire me.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I'm never satisfied.
Tom is twice younger than you.
Tom closed the lid.
I'm married to a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is the heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you say that first?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
I was tired of a 12-hour trip.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
Nobody saw us do that.
He came back two days later.
Tom's gone by tomorrow.
We should be at home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know Tom and Mary are engaged.
Food!
Did you help him wash the windows?
It's beyond my competence.
It was yesterday.
I love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm over here.
Don't tell me what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you this.
What are you gonna say then?
You talked about your hobby?
Come down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed these cards to my friends.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I dropped the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want me to say?
Please open the door.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of twenty.
I can't give that dictionary to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.
I know Tom is higher than Mary.
I didn't have time to do this today.
Mary told me to help him.
The number from “person” is “people”, not “persons”.
It's two steps.
You ruined everything!
I think that's why I had to stay in Boston.
Did you invite him?
Tom told me what the baby's name is.
Tom thinks I'm in Boston right now.
Tom didn't want to buy a new car.
We're teachers.
Tom will find you.
Everyone has weaknesses.
I hope they pay you well.
Tom didn't eat meat at all.
This book seemed interesting to me.
Hundreds of unemployed people sleep there day and night.
I guess I'll be late.
Your kids know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup gives the fish.
There are lots of girls in the room.
He talks too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in her coffee.
Didn't you know I used to teach French in Boston?
Tom was very surprised.
They tried to win the time.
I already discussed it with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke about the horrific, Jewish, Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the inability to claim the existence of any sacred language, whose use in prayer draws special attention to God.
After all, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast wasn't wrong.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'm gonna ask Tom to prepare you for something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom wasn't wearing a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man.
Tom's on duty tonight.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing a little piano.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom's up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
Rest is important.
Have you ever called Lucy?
A good idea came to her mind at the last moment.
There's a very hot air in this room.
Why aren't you in the sweater today?
Pound is a unit of weight.
I wouldn't talk to him again in your place.
Japan consumes a lot of paper.
It's very hard.
You betrayed me.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tom seems very busy.
And I'm very happy to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help Tom.
Is that my book?
Laundry is routine work.
Who else is on your list?
Don't let that make me a phone.
I've already decided who I'll go with.
I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you need to talk to them.
He reads physics in Oxford.
He was hiding this fact from me.
Did you save me?
He screamed loudly in his sleep.
What's your favorite browser?
Tom learned Mary by voice.
You don't even look at me.
Tom is too lazy to do it.
Please stop fighting.
Grandpa always said the days would come like today.
I didn't tell her that.
I want to live in Australia.
No one could help them.
When did you meet her?
Thanks to your timely efforts, the people who were trying to help you in your work have not been able to put themselves in danger in the Theatre, and the Masky are rehearsing a new pantomime.
After the earthquake, many decided to sleep in tents on the street.
Tell your people to abandon their weapons.
There's a secret door in the library.
Mike has friends in Florida.
We both laughed.
We need three more chairs.
I like this office.
I have a friend who lives in England.
Tom's trying hard.
Why won't you be tomorrow?
We need to get to know each other better.
Somebody said something, but I didn't.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get himself to the hospital.
I sat down next to Tom.
Your voice is upset.
You've always been so selfish?
I think that medicine will be very useful to you.
Tell him to be here by half the third.
It's not a god's news that's science.
Tom suspected Mary was taking drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't tell her.
I'm afraid it's raining.
Want a beer?
Where did you see him?
The poor cat was on the threshold of hungry death.
I've learned so much from my mistakes that I think I'm gonna do some more!
My favorite color is blue.
I have made some corrections.
You don't know what you're talking about.
A Football player hit the ball.
It's a good book to sell.
Tom didn't say anything.
I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that.
Positive nuclear nucleus attracts negative electrons.
You're so wrong!
Tom opened his bag.
Everyone looked at my feet.
Tom was the first to come.
Don't help me, I want to do it myself.
I'm not good.
Come to me.
The hotel gave me an account of 8,000 yen for the number.
I stopped chasing the fashion.
Tom's allergic.
I know this girl's father.
I definitely don't know what my kids want at Christmas.
Why did she do that?
Tom has it?
I finally got to work.
Tom's in the kitchen, washing the dishes.
Temperature has dropped by three degrees.
Tom refused to let Mary go to the party.
Tom won't ask me to do that.
I want to be like him.
I'll never tell you.
The bus was overcrowded.
Where do you want to go for the next weekend?
How wonderful is that?
I've got a humiliation.
Tom wasn't polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
That car's a good sale.
I have to work for these weekends.
You can't do that to us.
His words made me embarrassed.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know what to do.
Say hello to her.
Was that a lie?
Tom's answer shook everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in return?
I have to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it at the store.
The world is rude.
I've got a good dream.
That's why there's nothing to do with anyone but yourself.
I'm from Sydzooki.
Tom burned all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is the day he is free.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in thirty minutes.
He told me he'd do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you very much for staying with me.
She didn't give me anything.
Eat right.
He wrote to his parents.
I'm pleased with what I am.
What are you doing here just now?
It's a pottalon nice.
I want to know if Tom and Mary eat meat.
Tom wouldn't listen to my advice.
You want to say something to Tom?
You don't want another son?
How can I give up my weight?
I think we should report to the fact that we're going to be late.
Where are our friends?
Don't forget us.
They tried to hide their anxiety.
There's a big body in this cathedral.
I don't think you're right.
Did you find him?
Do you want me to come in?
Please put me on this side of the light brass.
Tom shot and killed a tiger.
I've never met anyone above me.
How much is the rusty torment worth?
I want to drink something cold.
What's the difference?
Each nation has its own special character.
A healthy person doesn't know the price of health.
Did I miss something interesting?
I had to tell them myself.
The public started laughing.
You don't pay attention to me.
I have a broken ankle.
You like to take pictures, don't you?
He's a noble knight without fear and fear.
They hate women.
I don't have any details with myself.
Tom was trying to run.
What color does her eyes have?
Come quickly!
You overestimate him.
How many weeks ago?
Tom was sleeping in his room.
Do you know why it's happening?
I looked around.
Tom's still alive.
Hawaiian is my favorite pizza.
Tom was a hokkee fan.
Who was the first one here?
Are you singing in the choir?
You were home last night?
I've been homeless for three months.
She said she wanted to win.
Prices are going to go down.
I'm glad Tom wasn't hurt.
I never hurt anyone.
It wasn't an accident.
Don't blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom's yelling at Mary.
This is my favorite song.
Don't leave the engine on.
I don't know what's in the box.
Tom said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You're very perceptive.
Again and again, there are obstacles in our life, some call them problems, others speak of opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him to fishing.
You won't have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with my friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog grazing in the woods.
He told me he wanted to leave the company.
You want to come in?
You and I both know it won't happen.
I thought you knew them.
Tom bought me a hot dog.
I'll be back late.
We need actions, not words.
Tom was suspected of being a spy.
You just run away from problems.
A courtyard without women like a garden without flowers.
You can't leave the baby alone.
She'll do it if she can.
I'm done with that.
I put it on the cream of a bait.
Don't leave your glasses on the table!
We sold our souls for money.
Are you working tonight?
The wind's over.
I rarely met her.
I know it's really important.
I'm eating an apple.
Tom learns as diligently as the other boys of their class.
I'm not hungry.
Their job is to cook food for soldiers.
What happens if they catch us?
I can put things in the box.
I'm going to make orders in your bedroom today.
He speaks five languages.
Tom had a difficult childhood.
I'm divorced.
How did you know Tom was sick?
I like the way you say my name.
Tom didn't tell me anything.
There aren't kids in this class who are as high as Bill.
Should we go?
I knew you could be trusted!
Tom put the wood in the fire.
"Love never killed anyone." "Do you ask Romeo and Juliet."
What did the boy say?
I bought everything I planned.
It's like the operation of the virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I shouldn't have let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you'd come back.
These books are old.
Are we leaving already?
Neither Tom nor Mary have never been to Boston.
Have you ever sucked?
If I had money, I'd buy a computer.
Is Tom smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom's at school, isn't he?
Let us know, please.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove I'm wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have any pain somewhere?
He couldn't go because of a shortage of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door or we'll hack it!
Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't give up French.
I think that's why we can trust.
There are a lot of mysteries in life.
Isn't it too salt?
Tom and Mary look healthy.
It's an apple of rottenness.
Tom said he didn't have any money.
Boston is the favorite city of Tom.
I'm sorry when someone dies.
Are you getting better?
What makes you think that we might be interested?
I'll think about you every day until I'm gone.
That was a bad rate.
The thought that she was going alone was bothering me.
The river flows in size.
He looks like Johnny Deppa.
I've been watching them.
Do you really love her?
He gave an account of the facts without comment.
He was dark green.
He'll definitely come.
Do you have a message?
Yesterday, Tom called me unexpectedly.
We really need that.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I'll get the glasses.
I decided to give up.
Their only son was selected by an accident.
Everybody knows there's something new in this old capital.
I'm always careful.
I went to the market.
You brought a towel?
Tell him I have his keys.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom went to the bus going to Boston.
Sleeping, she's scratching the elbow.
I'm sick.
We'll deal with Tom later.
You want to be rich?
They call you.
You're both very impressed tonight, I'm proud of you.
She doesn't like my manner of talking.
Mary wants another baby.
I don't care what you're doing with your money.
I'd like to see the boss.
Tom didn't go to Boston car.
For weather forecasts, we can't rely on it.
She's still young.
Did you follow Tom's advice?
Tom said he was a fartton.
How's your father?
They said when?
This car looks angry.
Do you study English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.
Why does the moon shine at night?
I couldn't understand anything that Tom said.
You won't need that anymore.
Tom did it on purpose.
Let's think about it.
I know Tom wants you to do it.
Tom said he didn't know anything about robbery.
You know everyone here?
Tom couldn't read until thirteen years.
I prefer hooked eggs.
She lives in Muhosransk.
Those people who aren't smarter than I, I don't care.
Is that your first visit to Australia?
The owls are wise.
Tom asked for some water.
The loser had a brook in all three networks he had given him.
I can't go with you because I'm very busy.
Kilograms of figs cost two and a half euros.
A lot of animals in the zoo?
She's the pride of her class.
In other equal conditions, temperature is the most important factor in this experiment.
It's better without meaning than without a suggestion!
What is he talking about?
I haven't seen Tom a long time ago.
Tom said he didn't want to sleep yet.
What's Tom on the floor?
There's no direct flights to Bologna from here.
I live outside town.
Give me a few hours.
Don't make yourself eat if you don't want to.
I have an assignment for Tom.
"How was the accident?" "No one knows."
What do you like in it?
When I arrived at the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Do not believe anything he says.
Tom was free of his foreign accent.
We all knew it would happen sooner or later.
No one expressed disagreement.
She's running.
It's a man.
If the Icelandic language were in color, I think it would be white.
Do you know where the meeting will be?
I'd like them to be happy.
I want to ask you out of work.
Christianity has many followers.
The carpets absorb the sound.
Tom told me it was impossible.
It must be Tom's place.
Tom's a weird kid.
The phone was invented by Bell in 1876.
I fell asleep on his shoulder.
I know you're working a lot.
I love Ural languages.
I hope you're mistaken on this account.
Sometimes it is necessary to speak the truth.
Tom's an opponent.
I have a suggestion for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married on 20 October.
If you want to be alone, I'll leave.
He's got a lot of talents.
He's in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?
He's got a Japanese father.
Who would want to kill him?
I was in a hurry.
He says he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he was tired.
He's sitting in late night.
Tom's room is very small.
Are you speaking Italian?
The girl smiled for me.
This song is doomed to success.
I'll surprise you.
We showed them what we could do.
I'm proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns in his furnace both a tree and a coal.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We have to be prepared.
What were his first words?
I'll take them with me, okay?
Tom left Mary his keys.
I'm talking to him all the time.
I can't help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zechariah, God foreshadowed the reconciling of the kingly power and priesthood in Jesus Christ.
You want me to talk to Tom?
Every one of us went home.
The thread's thin but strong, and it's not going back.
It's a little stupid.
I don't know what I want at this point.
That's incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six-five for the TV!
I think she's a good dancer.
Tom's interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really so bad?
Tell me, please, where you're going to live.
They all need attention.
I'm on my own.
He didn't want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one saw you come in here.
It's Tom's voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I wasn't beautiful.
Are you crying a lot?
We did not expect such results.
I've read this before.
If the car breaks, let's walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Did you find anything interesting?
Everybody's doing it.
I often go to see my relatives.
He'll be expelled from our club.
You have to be punished for what you did.
They got up the stairs.
She's got to drink water.
It's one of the most ugly buildings I've ever seen.
The robber broke into a post office in the middle of the day.
That's why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come, too.
With God's help...
I don't like coffee too much.
My desk is old.
We're both very busy.
The darkness is obscene.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I'll get you.
Tom tried to drown in the bathroom.
Tom and I have one growth.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You're acting like a fool.
Tom likes to play cards.
It's a big book.
Don't say that about Tom.
I kind of made myself clear.
We've been waiting for three hours.
It's important that you understand.
Time can change, but human nature is the same.
Tom looks pretty upset.
I brought cookies.
Next year Tom will teach French.
I've listened to her for the rest.
I told him to rest.
Why is that hurting you?
The worst part of the trip's over.
We'll miss both of you.
Don't be so shy!
I heard that phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in his shoulder.
You don't speak French?
How dare you do that!
That knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
It'll take you only a minute.
I would really like to change that situation.
We took care of everything.
I used to be very fat.
They're not coming back.
You don't have to believe any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a squirrel in a wheel.
He didn't survive.
Don't you want to come with us?
Is Tom able to swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We're going to leave as soon as possible.
He went to ski on Hokkaido.
"Stop your fucking music and read the book." "I see my censoring spell still works!"
You knew her better than I did.
I've already discussed it with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There's no salvation for her.
I'm sorry I did it without you.
You're getting blood out of your nose.
Mary kissed you, didn't she?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
Soon you will be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same as you.
We can't just ignore it.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where's the supermarket?
You have to trust me.
Tom didn't know Mary.
I don't think I like it.
Even if you're lying, join in.
Tom wanted to ask Mary again for forgiveness.
Tom was thoughtful.
You're too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I can't swim.
He was never there.
I really would like to come with you, but I can't.
It's never happened before.
I wasn't gonna do that.
I can't believe you.
I bought bread.
Let's go quickly, or you'll be late for school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom's not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they bear you?
Where are you going to live?
I'm usually a peaceful person, but it's hard to imagine what I'm capable of when my family is at stake.
Mary sewed Alice a new dress.
That decision was difficult to take.
I thought you'd want to drink.
I got what you asked me to do.
He said he'd do it.
So you didn't have to leave.
Mary recovered from her illness.
I didn't know where you were.
Where did Tom get that?
Eating meat harms your health and the environment.
You tell me you don't know anything about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom can't enjoy life.
I want you to talk a word for me.
Nobody loves me.
I'm sorry I don't know Tom's phone.
"You told him?" "No, he learned everything."
Your explanation was very clear.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I'm just sure you just thought about something.
Sahara is the largest source of dust in the world.
What do you like most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to talk to anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
Yesterday I read an interesting book.
Tom's gonna pay.
You don't need to know why.
My favorite tree is weeping Eve.
I don't have that book.
I don't see any difference.
What are you studying?
You're hopeless.
The sun is at the center of the solar system.
You're a cop?
Tom failed both me and Mary.
You shouldn't have said what you said.
He'll be back in a few days.
I cut a razor.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river was irrigating the garden.
The wind's cool at night.
The giraffes and giraffes are far-reaching relatives.
Tom did it because I told him that.
I'm not leaving.
Who taught you that?
You need him.
Tom carried two suitcases.
Tom, I don't think he knew me.
Someone's missing.
I'll tell her.
When are you leaving?
Don't slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I used to lie down early.
Do you think I wouldn't help you?
Tom's in the office.
All Tom's doing is watching TV.
Tom's in a good mood today.
It's the most delicious pearl I've ever eaten.
I had trouble parking.
I'd like you to meet my husband.
You can't do that.
She's not mine.
Do you know what this is?
Ottawa is the capital of Canada.
Tom never was late for school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go and ask your father.
You still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief comment on each letter.
You're hard to take seriously.
The tribes settled along the river.
I'll fix it.
I said let them go.
When did it begin?
Nobody cares about what she thinks.
I don't think that's weird at all.
"Where did you get my phone?" "Thom gave."
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do this.
Is there any point in doing that?
Why do you lock the door?
Tom said he was three times trying to do it.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
A plane flys out at eight o'clock in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can't write programs.
Change the subject.
I love traveling around the world.
Tom understands.
Tom's low but strong.
It's cool this morning, isn't it?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She's cooking dinner.
Find, please, Tom.
He'll give it to you.
The proposal is not clearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
You don't understand what's going on?
I'm glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you're fat?
Tom had fun with Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is infinite!
This box weighs a ton.
He's getting it because he's slack.
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.
He says he's never met her.
He seemed to kiss me.
Don't yell at me.
Are you having fun?
That's hardly gonna happen.
I'll order it later.
You didn't know Tom was going to Boston?
This is our school.
I've been free all day yesterday, and I'm working today.
Take your coat, it's cold tonight.
If you think about it, I really need a mobile phone.
Don't lose your patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a horrible man!
Carton's stronger than papers.
Don't be angry with him.
You've exceeded your authority.
The curse was destroyed.
Tom's grandfather was born blind.
Tom's higher than you, isn't he?
She hurt her back by playing tennis.
Tom's easy to frighten.
This table is white.
It was a weird game.
I've heard of all your problems.
I've known him for a year.
I'm going with you to Boston.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer, they traveled to the mountain resort.
You're not gonna tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary aren't afraid.
Can you get closer?
She's a little shy.
What kind of action do you expect from Tom?
She seemed quite calm.
Click on the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary wore her boots to her knee.
It's a lie.
I'll follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
Tom wants to follow his father's footsteps.
I don't see any problems here.
I don't have to do this tomorrow.
He lost his solar glasses.
It's awful bitter.
Tom told you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Last time Tom was the first.
Everything's different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Put the tree down there.
Do you typically wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom's gonna fix that.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
Mother was busy cooking dinner.
I don't understand what you're trying to say.
Small pots have long pens.
Tom was in sandals.
Under the tree is a bench.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
What's my story for you?
Tom turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you singing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
Tom often plays a guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was filled.
Tom is rarely wearing his tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he doesn't plan on going.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chicks.
Do you have a cable for Tom?
Whatever you say, I won't change my mind.
Tom can talk.
Thank you for your help.
Tom could have told me.
This will bring your family misery.
I was really nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It's useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You need to try not to sleep.
Mom helps me very much.
Tom's got a snake on his back.
You bought meat at the supermarket?
He hit me mistakenly.
What's that dog's name?
Go on the pavement.

You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do that again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you get her?
I've been to Sapporo.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She's always early.
Do you want her to help you?
Are you eating rice every day?
We were sitting at the very bottom of the audience.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When do we have a woman president?

I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.

I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Thomas to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should screw me up.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still be in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time treats everything.
Why do you always take his side?
It wasn't cold for us.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't let go of the case.

Some birds did not fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?

Take them to the hospital.

She never replied to his letter.
I hired someone to work today.
Stop waving the fool!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did it.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Can't you imagine me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told you Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like living in town?
How much time did you have for this?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's leader.
Who are you planning to go to Australia?
Somebody shouted.
What's better?
We're grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell him to leave.

Get the beasts out of the cell.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like a father.

Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please watch this movie.
Someone's calling.

Did you tell Tom?
I am!

I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know what you'd do for me the same thing.
I can't believe Tom did it all.
I don't want to listen to your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can the vicious circle be used in evidence and appreciated.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they only stared at me, so I couldn't make those bastards understand their own language.

I'll open it.
It's been ten hours, my mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
The owls are cute.

Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he gets there.
He must have missed her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris is far away?
How much time is it in Tokyo?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim won't come tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
Last Monday I saw you and Tom.
Where did you get your shoes?
We went to the beach.
What do you think it'll be this year's Christmas snow?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you until you pay me as well.
I'd like to have some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth at all lately.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have the second chance.

All the accounts have to pay me.

When I grow up, I want to be a fire.

We forgot to record!

This time, I'll forgive him.
I love Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.

How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I definitely didn't know where to start.
That's memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I've got two tickets for a concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's spearheaded.
He dictated several letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much does that cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to look after the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about 180 grams.
I should have left Tom's note.
Are you a Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half the third.
He likes it so much.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Has anyone else noticed that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom is kind.

You can write any language you want. In Tatoeba all languages are equal.
The infection was in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me for telling me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I still don't think so well.
Run, chicks!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The net is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the present situation of things.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
So it wasn't as difficult to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I tried to wake Tom up.
They say that the film is very interesting.
Do something with that, please.
As you know, we're late because of the heavy rain.
She seems to be healthy.
Tom was in his straw hat.
Watch your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for the permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I love the bitter pepper.
How much do you usually stand on Saturday?
I added milk in coffee.
How can I change this?
Spain adopted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We've done it together before.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincible ones.
Tom's winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're packed.
I didn't know it would be impossible to do it.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow last night?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.
Did you die of her?
Tom knows French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one age.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to walk.
We didn't discuss that.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the beast.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defence.
How Is Faith Different From Confidence?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you learn?
If the weather permits, we'll get to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to do this.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of Ra's god.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the harder it seemed.
His grey eyes glittered and glowed, and his typically pale face was alive and covered by a Romanian man.
What kind of pizza do you love most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were slept by the cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I find it difficult to solve this problem.
Typhoon destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here to speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your baggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I'm not waiting for you when I see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to study and play as my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not at all busy right now.
Children enjoy playing more than learning.
He was taken for his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm talking about.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend is a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on political talk.
Is that red or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Come on!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to that kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
What's the matter, all of a sudden you're in the fashion?
Tom said he didn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born tomorrow.
Tom's suit for pirates.
It's pure truth!
Let's go get the egg.
What are these people doing?
I did what I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here for 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll help you out.
We are proud of our achievement.
That's why Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me alone here.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop hitting the cat!
What are you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What kind of crime did you commit?
How do we know this man is the one for whom he turns himself out?
King Harald Hormsson, more famous as Harald Synezubai, introduced Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay a little longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last days were very hot.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to pour flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Tom's never seen Mary after that.
You can't go to this room.
Did you have other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bought Mary?
Tom likes to read Hermann Hesse.
Truly, I never spoke Portuguese.
When criminal cases reach court, it is generally accepted that the jury consists of 12 persons.
What exactly was Tom doing at the Australian embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys were marching around four in a row.
Tom was very puzzled.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do that.
Here's another day.
You have to do it right now.
Tomorrow I have to go to X-ray.
His bag was severely damaged.
He was wounded when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we'll be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably can't do that.
Excuse me for doubting you.
McDonalds is globally known for their hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a dear gift.
Do you have any opinion?
Do you like these spirits?
The lock's broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Have a cookie, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English vocabulary.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom's a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from underestimation?
Was it too simple?
What Alice faced, waiting for her answer, was a sudden warrior, a loud noise so sharp that she could break down her drums, and so loud to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
A lot of books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, aren't you?
We need to hire him.
I was in vain trying to solve the problem.
You should've done your homework.
I talked on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
That rock was so heavy that I couldn't raise it.
Why doesn't Tom sleep?
Both auctions will respond.
We've taken a canoe blast.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom great?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look very high at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey got on the tree.
The language I teach is very complicated.
Your baby can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
You really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom I've got the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been ruling for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Can't you solve this question?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would he do that?
Twenty-floor building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't know when Tom comes back?
I don't have Tom photos.
Can you wait a little?
Are you going to give him something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm a Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would have been a rich man now.
I made this decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the courage to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long are you planning to be home tonight?
The bag's empty.
Are you feeling all right?
He's stubborn like a donkey.
I think we can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had the foreboding that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to a party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom's ready to defend himself.
You've never been right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but some girl took the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she would win.
We must follow the plan.
I'll tell you what you called.
Tom's very tough on the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I'm mixing mayo with ketchup.
They complain forever.
Tom's got little oysters.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of dispersed.
Don't piss her off.
I'd better stay.
That's what a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's resting right now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe it's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and clean.
I suspect Tom needs to go to Boston next week.
Don't go outside the land.
Tom was horrible.
Tom's face is painted.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger for him was an abstract notion; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the hall.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the rats?
How long do you want to go?
She was sick with her legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important to both of us.
We have to take you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't often do that.
I hope we won't do that again.
How many times did you help Too to do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewelry are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get, there's gonna be an opening time.
I'm not sure how big she is.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on a flashlight and entered the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas's gone off the door.
We have to do it.
She couldn't help thinking about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn't admire them?
He and I cried.
Don't you want to try again?
Wait a little longer.
What's the matter with you?
Milk can be made with oil, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I've got a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her family?
When you drink water, remember those who dug the well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for a younger daughter.
Be good.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an unfamiliar guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He snapped back.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You can do it if you try.
You didn't think of asking Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Could you say that in human language?
Nobody's hungry except me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in a snowflake doesn't feel guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know I forgive you.

We checked.
Go see what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think it works like this.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you going tomorrow?
A hole lizard.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.

I'll take care of it immediately.
I don't trust her.

Scala is an anagram of lavishness.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.

Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.

Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've read this before.
It's thanks to you.

What really happened last weekend in Boston?
What is the point of learning?

As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The picture hangs on the wall.

Are you coming with her?
Let's take one of those ready lunches that are sold at the station.
Tom was trying to kill them.
She says she's happy.

Let's see something else.
You think it's an accurate translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both wanted to eat.
That's why there's nothing to do.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You really helped.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take into account his age.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom began to suspect something was wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you're tired, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
Did you know Mary was Tom's wife?
I have to go on.

Look at that girl.
Tom's got a live imagination.
He's got a broken neck.
What are you talking about?
Yesterday, you left the bar just at the moment I was going to put everyone in my bill.
Tom told me it was working.
I want to play chess.
I'm backing you 100 percent.
I haven't seen you for almost three years.
You should tell her how you feel.
I have a light headache.
I heard about what happened.

Don't open this box.
I hate waiting.
I sometimes see him at the club.
Tom asked Mary why she was crying.

I stayed in Boston for three days.
I'm sure he's hiding something from us.
Tom knocked him off his feet.
Tom tried to prevent Mary from opening the door.
I didn't do anything wrong.
You need to do more.
Only you can manage your money.

Who are you to decide?
Pull the cat down.

Do you like driving?
The car didn't move.

This skirt is too tight.
We'll try to keep it calm.
Tom's in the park with his friends.
She talked fast.
That's why Mary didn't have to be deceived.
The baby's in the cradle.
I didn't tell them you were here.
Tom stuck the offer and copied it.
You could've hurt yourself.
Get out of this room.
You don't have to smoke while you work.
Tom wanted to play poker with us, but Mary didn't let him.
Tom didn't do anything all week, just complained about Mary's shit.

I'd like to be a Canadian.
It's only sometimes.

I'd like to talk to you privately.
I thought you weren't dating him anymore.
This magazine is well sold.
Her clothes attracted a lot of attention at the party.
They're gonna get married tomorrow.
She was right, and he was wrong.
They pulled lots to whom to go first.
Maybe we should ask him the way.
Fortunately, it worked.
Tom won't call.
He said he was cold.
I love spending time with my friends.
I didn't know you were Canadian.

She has a very tense schedule.
Tom is also speaking French.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
The garden was filled with tiger lilies.
I told her not to do that.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
We're here to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to go.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, I'm ignored." "He's coming!"
He has one purpose in life to earn money.
He gave the dog a piece of meat.
A letter to you.
Tom's grandfather couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Should I come with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom was staying at the hotel.
I explained it to her.
Tom's not resolved.
Battone nucleus!
I'll take my leave if it's raining.
Everything must be perfect.
There's something I want to talk to you about.
It's the highest building I've ever seen.
It'll cut my ears.

You didn't look tired.
I'll pray earnestly.
What are you gonna do if the war begins again?

I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us what he was so upset.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.

He got out of bed.
The trains are followed according to the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible to avoid confusion in languages.

Is there an exam tonight?
What motivates you?
Sami gave Leila his computer.
Shoot your sleeve.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom would agree to meet us?
They say that in America anyone can become president, but that's probably not the case.

Didn't you see that?
You need me to call.

I'll give you some more time to think.
Translate it to French, please.
Take the cold steel away!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
That's Tom told me about what happened.
Coss and kill.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
Tom has a weak heart.
So we'll have to pay for her.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his overhead beard.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm half a Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix her.
You have to come back.
We've already talked.
I can't believe I'm finally able to do that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is thirteen?
I don't know which book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's dressed in a white cotton shirt.
It's the tower.
I'll have to wait.
It was Sunday yesterday, not Saturday.
Is there anyone here who knows them?
They're watching you.
How long do you want?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.

We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of broad avenues in this town.
What are you carrying?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to marry next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's not stronger than I am.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't make people do that.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Are they sleeping together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know what you knew.
I won't let her come in.
The neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She's also got shortcomings.
I wonder why that's why.
It seems suspicious to me.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only Boston here.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter is about to end.
The titles and the rewards don't mean anything to me.
Where did you even find him?
The meeting's prolonged.
I'll find out.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
Don't you want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring him a drink.
What do you want to eat on these weekends?
Get together!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for your rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxist when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not gonna buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I'm connecting you to her.
She received the highest grades.
Tom might be getting up.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have in your childhood?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do that.
I was a little scared.
Tom used a cocktail cottage.
I'd like to lie down.
Get me some note papers or something like that.
I want to relax in front of TV tonight, I don't want to get out of the house.
He'll be here tonight.
The cat's dead.
It's only half nine now?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I wouldn't mind if you smoked.
This lake is unsafe.
I cut my finger yesterday.

My car is covered with pigeon shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie's home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not going to make this mistake anymore.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I persuaded her to marry him.
I've been waiting for my whole life this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the examination?
The plane went into the airport.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any correspondence friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary lost her mind.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to a concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd love to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your probes?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do that for you.
"Hi," said Tom sillyly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm hurting everything.
She didn't have food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the pricing.
You don't have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: someday it will be transferred.
You're not gonna find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are his own souls.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I never worked with her.
She began to learn from her new office.
Let us take care of this.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do this yesterday.
It's a few early drinks, isn't it?
My parents don't like how I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay may stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him nicely and hard.
Because, worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I get you a hand?
He's green.
Tom heard a noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom didn't lie all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about the target.
We have to start looking at the seasons off!
Road accidents occur daily.
Where did you ride on skiing?
You've been in the parrot?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the balloon pen.
The only way to know what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Disappearing.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture with each other.
I failed in the examination.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
Footballist made a huge mistake.
Will they come, too?
She's sleeping like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brake.
This song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hug.
That's my cat.
Do you have any children?
Tom didn't want breakfast.
They like Tom.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-reliant idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I suppose you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all cowards.
Tom thinks it's a sin to throw out food.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place is blinking right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why didn't you talk to Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has made a lot better.
Let's go to church.
Tom screwed the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I didn't see him any more.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you immediately.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
Nobody knew about that.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do it.
The kidnapper will steal a cow.
Tom's not very good at swimming, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just the shadow of himself.
How do we do this?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Anything happens.
What day is it?
Let's give him another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Did Paul kiss Lily in his lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I must stay together.
I heard only good about him.
I'm not working here anymore.
What do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You won't compare with us.
I saw the car exploded.
The window is here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV broadcast?
You want to go to the movie tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's case is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you'll lose.
I like going to school.
I offered help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank you for your son.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
The dog is yours.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell him I'm going to come home tonight.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer instilled courage in his people.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying things like that.
I don't really know how to hunt.
For the first time, I'm cooking the grill meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many prons do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It's already been known to everyone.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You shouldn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said that.
Who told you a story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom's supposed to be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I bounce every month.
I told you I didn't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an apple sour.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Do you take work for home?
According to mythology, Prometheus abducted a sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the physics world.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before he was burned.
I want to help you figure this out.
You speak French better than I do.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were frozen in the night sky.
I doubt Tom's gonna win.
"Eh, here you have so boring." -- "My boy, this world is looking for..." -- "Here and I, your Majesty, Henon and his servants have captured the island of Coridaiy. "Hmm. How can we..." -- "How is it written, only Link can overcome Genon. "Yeah, how can we. "
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch going right?
I'll see you on Sunday at three.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're good at it.
I met her on her way home from school.
I didn't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm headed for that guy's home.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed money.

I just wondered if you had any experience you'd like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What kind of music are you listening to in the car?
That's what I was told three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It's going to be totally dependent on him.
I met a classmate.
He's grown up enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was swollen with a power.
Nobody saw them come out of the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We talked about you.
What kind of music are you usually listening to?
There's no food without bread.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
You had to quit smoking for a long time.
Stop joking!
Some of my classmates know nothing about computers.
Did you like the bicycle?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
So they were not allowed to leave.
I didn't find them right away.
Hurry up, please, Tom's waiting.

Mary forgot to shut the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call Too tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic powers.
Who is he from nationality?
Tom was sitting with John in one cell.
I didn't mean to swim.
He drank a beer.
Nowadays, it's harder for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom's wake up!
I'll fix my nose dresses.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She came out and yelled at me.
Did you take your medication?
Boys are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time's on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bouling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still angry.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of pale rubber?
Not that happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I understand.
Tom stretched Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my soul.
Tom's got a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's gonna try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom is dead.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between Mary and the door.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The championship manager is a complimentary master.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I'm working.

He had to live in a room with a brother.
I'm not imbecile.

I can't hunt.
He's got a brother in Tokyo.
Dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can go if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already talked to this student.
What is the chemical symbol of bromide acid?
We've got a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to the lawyer.
I think you should do it.
That's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a palace.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
Neboscreb is in the middle of town.
Who sent you?
She tied him to the sweater.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come with you to Boston.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine, is it cheaper?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
How long are you planning to stay?
We ate hurriedly and left.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start every meal from the soup.
I'm afraid of being alone.
What's she whispering to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The cabin was open.
I've been guilty.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to see you before I die.
She's beautiful too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I propose another strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
Did you know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She sings?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go in the car.
You're hindrance to me.
She wondered what his lips would taste.
A good coach trainer trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was detained because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What makes you think I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It was supposed to be you.
Mary left my hat in the room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You won't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom planned to do that or not.
I'm falling.
I couldn't come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he didn't go outside.
On the street, I saw my friend.
How many houses are there on your street?
Elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" "My name is Tom."
Her native language is French.
It's a wool coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naivety is its only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
The baby Tom lived in Boston.
I didn't eat six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She kept quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary's always very welcome, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies sleep under cradle.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
Excuse me for upsetting you.
The one who has never left his country is full of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when the snow falls.
Tom's helping his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I included imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mother opposed me driving alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
You know what you're doing, right?
Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You don't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
There's plenty of fish in this river.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're peers with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had those symptoms?
Prisoner's released.
What did they say?
Could you leave the door open?
It's gonna have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice as old as I am.
Tom knows that what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a soft climate.
Check it out again.
Don't condemn Tom.
My mother finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom only pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your view of taxes.
Tom's watching.
We can open the windows again.
There's never been one with me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was gonna come out when I called the phone.
I don't have to tolerate it.
Always shrink the road to the right.
We're asked to be in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's pretty, but I don't like her.
I can give you a ride if you want.
Tom told Mary she was wasted her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I've never asked her.
Nothing so relaxes like a hot bath.
I don't really have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
It's on the table with the open book.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about it.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my lover!
The sound of your voice is like a melodic dreen song for me.
How does it feel to be married?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers were left on the print window.
Chemistry is great science.
I feel like my French doesn't get any better.
How do I get my passport best?
Perhaps you can help Tom.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
It's still bright outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my father's car, but it'll be mine soon.
You forgot his name?
If I had time to do this, I'd do it.
Do you see Tom's boat?
A big Thomas?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
My stomach hurts.
Do you know how I was busy?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I don't have to trust anyone.
She's a worshiper of Sex in a big city.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Get him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing is like a glass of beer after a long day of work.
What happened?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How long will you need?
Let's get some rest here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom said.
She cut off the flux when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
That peach is beautiful.
Do you see?
Tom's not thrilled.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good work!
You often say that yourself.
Here are some letters for you.
It is almost unthinkable that a scientist at that level would make such a basic mistake.

She misled the students.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I've filled up the backstairs.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it now.
What kind of house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this afternoon?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't often drive.
So it doesn't like the end of the film.
Just get inside.
Just apologize to him.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow, there will be a strong snowfall.
We decided to move the meeting to the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.

What book are you looking for?
I don't sleep much.
Someday you'll get there.
Tom's good with Mary.
"You owe me money." "No, you shouldn't."
He came and kneeled.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did it for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.

I was drinking milk.
It'll be snow tomorrow.
Isn't life wonderful?
When it comes to preparation, no one is compared to Mary.
You're not alone lately.
Tom lost his foot when he attacked a shark.
I burned it for you.
We'll do it as it's time.
Next year I'll be three times older than you.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom is a little higher than Mary.
Nobody seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it?
This tissue is coming to your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom was lying to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to do that.
Tom and I were surprised.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a few times.
This time you went too far.
It works.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
It's nothing surprising,' said Tom.
We want to rent an apartment in town.
They spoke French.
It's extremely expensive.
He doesn't sing anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woke up yet.
Tom a couple inches above Mary.
I'm glad you offered it.
Your question is hard to answer.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
That sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just told him to leave Mary alone.
Didn't you know Tom was living in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for work.
Why do you need a hammer?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of darkness.
The situation's getting worse.
I'm picking where to bite.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's split up.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give them to him.
Run, or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom sets himself on meditation every morning.
Have you checked your calculations?
He tried to make a short story.
The room without books is like a soulless body.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you for a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.
It's easy to impress.
You're grown-up enough to do it yourself.
Aristotle believed that the earth was the center of the universe.
I wonder what Tom really meant.
Nobody understands me.
There are so many stars in the sky, I can't count them.
Everyone turned around and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom don't have to ask me to do something a few times.
Let us wash today whoever loses a paper stone!
I'm so unhappy!
I'd never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He's running Russian, at least he said that to me.
Tom's a third-trainer.
Will you stay for a long time?
I'm not a woman.
She has a tall father.
The train was overcrowded.
The house's red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You know Boston well, don't you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention that before?
Tom didn't want to be a knocker.
He was born at 7 p.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom only eats white meat.
Thank you for helping me.
We only have three rules.
She bought one for herself.
The guards didn't see Tom.
In recent years Tom's been a mother-in-law.
I helped carry those bags.
They're full of time.
Fifteen times five is seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You don't know what he's gonna say yet.
My hands are tired.
I lied to my wife all the time.
Finally, she succeeded.

When are you gonna tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Uh, you're so boring here!
Reading the book is like traveling.
Tom saw Mary enter the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary was likely to win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I miss Boston so much.
She always writes letters.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do that.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I don't give up disobedient children.
Tom bought it for me.
What you said was pissed at everyone.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for thirty years.
She showed her talents.
I wish that was possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At the next school festival, Bob will play the first time.
You have to stay uniformed.
I've been screwing seeds all day.
At the accent, I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Pity!
Tom obeyed.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for that.
Do you know how to ski?
The Duke owns many lands.
At least have fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting comfortable.
You'll feel like you're at home.
It won't end well!
He looked like he didn't eat a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get the fuck out of here!
So what's this, I'm wondering, if it's not the sale of goods at home, then maybe it's a new way to get to know girls?
Tom picked up a coin.
Why didn't you leave your room?
If God is not, then it is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please strap the belts during the flight and the landing.
That was Tom and Mary.
We both like seafood.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
I rejected the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'll have too much time to explain why it won't work.
Nothing changed.
Did you build all this for yourself?
I'm looking forward to a summer vacation.
Can I formulate it differently?
From here, he looks great.
The wooden homes are easily ignited.
Let's start that party.
The dog's still alive.
I'm going to university.
I know you lied.
The bed is very convenient.
I'll do this report tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's trembling.
I want to listen to your side.
I'll wait here for his coming.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I've got to think about it like that.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is José, we're friends.
You forgot to mention it.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everyone's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged a meeting?
I'm such a miserable guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the skirt.
What bird can't fly?
That must be put to an end.
Tom didn't answer immediately.
Tom died at seventy years of age.
Life is a gift.
Tom speaks French too.
The invention of a transistor has marked a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexei?
You look like a girl.
Here are some pictures.
What's going on in the tenth channel?
I hate spinach.
Mother's cooking lunch.
Tom is a pilgrimage.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's inclined to give in to emotion.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You're just saying obviously.
He had cancer.
You're the one to blame for it.
He's clear like a watch.
I know where you're going.
You're catching everything on the fly.
Let's roll him up.
Let's leave this before tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing that.
The cleaning woman stopped talking.
A cat on a written desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not stabbing anymore.
Tom was an envious smoker.
Tom put on his gloves.
Tom's hard to talk to.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to that weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him decorate the snow?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has an inheritance disease.
That's disgusting.
Is that snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
The best protection is the attack.
She's married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Can we help you with anything?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigations began last year with the confiscation of computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How you doing?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What makes you think you can't?
We went back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe it?
Thank you for your correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's pushing his pencil.
Tom can't ride a bicycle.
I'm not talking to the service at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed.
I spent 500 dollars in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Put it anywhere.
They didn't have time.
It's seven thirty now.
I see you woke up.
I want to know who told Tom.
Tom got up early to see the sunrise.
Dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually go up one step.
Tom had that year.
I'm near the station.
Tom is a very good boy.
Are you drinking?
You're from Boston, right?
Put it on my writing desk.
Tom got out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you've done.
I've got everything out of my hands today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom was only 30 years old to learn how to drive.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed so long.
The knife was not sharp enough to cut meat, so I used my feather knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You're about to adapt to village life.
Keep a bucket next to the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
Here's the deepest river.
Thank you from the heart.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
Maybe you should tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Individual words when they are to be written in a slippery language, a big problem in Norwegian.
What do you do with the remaining rice?
It's been ten years since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left shortly after that.
You should read that book.
Tom and Mary made lessons before dinner.
I don't want to drink your tea.
You're always so romantic.
Wife's not a boot, you're not going to throw it off your leg.
I'll pick you up at six.
I teach Tom French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary's got brown eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom's going to be in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give him a chance.
I like the fruits.
Tom lied.
He's selling cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate an egg.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check it out.
Tom gave Mary a gun.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to get to the bus.
Let's wait until Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake here.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning beats twice in one place.
I'm not boasting.
Leave it for later.
Tom told Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
You make it yourself.
You were surprised?
We counted the annual ring on the tree that we cut down and determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom to never write to my daughter again.
Rabbits breed fast.
I don't want to talk about it now.
How much is the coat cleaning going to take?
We'll paint her.
The opening's narrow.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness knocks on your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tell me frankly.
I'll be there anyway.
Do you mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonolulu.
You don't tell me anything I wouldn't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last.
Tom signed a request.
Did you try to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know so much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Would you like them to help?
Tom can't be seen anywhere.
That's what I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Could you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's a butterfly.
I slept on my belly.
Keep me informed.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.

I was too ambitious.
You want to hear my opinion?
I had to stop him.
I feel like it's gonna rain.
Mary's parents hate Tom.
I did so at his request.
I can read English, but I can't speak.
Thank you for taking me through the road!
I'm going to free this closet so you can use it.
The bride is an American of Polish origin.
Someone meets me here.
How many sandwiches?
Russia and China are best friends of Algeria.
Are you afraid of dogs?
Did you cry?
Tom won't buy bread.
She's not my grandmother, she's my mom.
This book is popular with students.
I told him you were hungry.
I like everything that's connected to summer.
I expect you to be ready for half a third.
The sine and cosine functions shall take the values between -1 and 1 inclusive.
I'll never let you go.
The police really arrested someone.
The baby is not a receptacle that needs to be filled, but a fire that needs to be burned.
My birthday is Sunday this year.
Tom was armed with a rifle and a knife.
You won't forget them.
My name is all known in my school.
I knew you'd miss me.
I couldn't find his house.
I'm thinking about going to Australia next spring.
Someone's coming.
He's been outside the window for an hour.
I burned that cookie for them.
You're twisting my words.
Let's go back to the third lesson.
Tom's not often at home.
I hope you feel at home.
I'm still waiting.
That soup's very delicious, isn't it?
A huge crowd of people were waiting.
There's a bottle in the refrigerator.
I still can't believe Tom hates Mary.
Tom didn't say when he'd be here.
You like Tom very much.
Can you do that for me?
I can do a little for you right now.
I'm here because I was asked to come.
Shortly before the explosion, a man who was suspicious of himself was observed.
He's sitting with his crossed feet.
I definitely heard the scream.
There are many foreign tourists in Asacus.
I wrote it for Tom.
You're not married?
Tom must have been drunk.
Tom told you where he's going?
He's not richer than I am.
If only I could tell you!
She's late for the train.
I'm going to the sea in the summer, and in the winter I go to the mountains.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know everything about me.
The old man lives alone.
You're so stupid.
He's almost never angry.
You're kind of tough.
I don't know how to do it.
What would you like to find?
I'll be on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, and Mary on Wednesday.
Are there raw eggs safe?
What's Empair Steit Bilding's height?
How are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, that's true.
Can we lock this door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you all doing here?
The police arrested the robber.
Keep Tom in ignorance.
I'm not going to school today.
You two go with me.
Tom was drinking red wine, and Mary was white.
I read the article.
It used to belong to them.
He doesn't even notice me.
He is the shame of the whole city.
Are you struggling?
The pigeon stirred it up.
That's my favorite.
I don't think someone noticed what Tom's doing.
I'm not selling my soul.
It's not my house.
They should have moved fast.
I think you paid too much for that.
I'll take it.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You're above all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my boss to raise my salary.
Do you know how much trouble you've brought?
Could you conduct me?
Mary closed her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom looks a little like a father.
We never talked about that.
I know what that means.
I had to act quickly.
Mary said she'd do it herself.
Don't you remember how I told you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to the doctors in French.
Roots are used to produce cars.
Tom's punctuality was never different.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
They were all surprised to see me there.
Drink for my health!
He cut himself with a knife yesterday.
The singer suddenly turns to the falzette.
You don't have any temperature.
Thank you so much for that information.
I can't afford to buy a new bicycle, so I'll have to do this old man.
Tom doesn't think Mars has a life.
I can't spend the whole day here.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I visited Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She didn't look like she was more than sixty years old.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done it many times.
Don't play poker with them.
Tom's upset with something.
I'll get her right away.
I want to devote this song to To.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom was holding the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay attention to Mary.
Tom lives in one building with me.
Don't blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom would come see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers on the plate.
They took her.
Mary could've done it if she did.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go to dinner.
Can I have one, too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
This is the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I've been thinking about them all day.
I can't read or write.
How's Tom?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
X-ray showed that two fingers were broken.
Tom said Mary really wanted to eat.
That's why I had to go there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a little.
The laws must be respected.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I do it for money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I count?
I thought you'd laugh.
Mary put on two sweaters.
You'll see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to take them to work.
I'm sure he's smart.
How dear should I go?
Are you born there?
My hearing's not the same anymore.
He said it was nine.
Mum was flying.
There's no time for that.
Both of these suitcases are mine.
Prices are growing.
She's not mistaken.
Today, I'll finally tell you what I really think about him.
Don't get mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like singing?
I love winter.
Show me her picture.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom, of course, doesn't think so.
He called me just when I was going to go to bed.
If I can do that, then you can.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
