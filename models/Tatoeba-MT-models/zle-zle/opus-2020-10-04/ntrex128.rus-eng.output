Welsh Assembly members do not want to “mappets”
Among some members of the National Assembly, it would be a matter of disappointment to propose to adopt the MWP abbreviation for their name (from the Member of the Welsh Parliament, a member of the Wales Parliament).
The problematic solution relates to plans to change the title of the Assembly to the Wales Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the lieborists, expressing the opinion of his party, expressed concern that the new abbreviation was “refunded by Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, not from Wales: in the Wallyan twp means "dust" and pwp "wash".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Wales Party, his organization as a whole was “rejected” and offered other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “no objection” to the new abbreviation but note that MWP is close to writing Muppet (muppet).
In this context, the letter w in the Wallyan language is spoken roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire English dialect.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently drafting the draft law on the change of title, made the following statement: “The final decision on how to name the members of the Assembly will, of course, remain behind them.”
The Welsh Management Act of 2017, the National Assembly of Wales, has the authority to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options, according to which the Wales Parlament had found broad support for the local population instead of the Assembly.
With regard to the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of the Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament, or WMP), while the version MWP received the greatest public support.
It seems that the Assembly offers other options, but the presiding member, Elina Jones, will find it difficult to find a convenient solution, reminding us that the draft law on changes should be submitted within a few weeks.
The reform laws would include other modifications to the work process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the Committee ' s system.
Members will vote in favour of the final version of their name in the debate on the bill.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on the change in the name of their country
On Sunday, the Macedonians will vote on the renaming of the country as the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” involves territorial claims to the Greek province and has repeatedly opposed its northern neighbour ' s entry into the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the change in the country ' s name is the very price of EU and NATO accession.
Crisis in the harlems: St. Martin's bell was silent.
“ The areas I had been talking to said that earlier in each corner was a bar and a church, ” relates Adams.
“Now there is no one left.”
The disappearance of the bars is still clear:
“The form of communication has changed.”
“Bar ceased to be a kind of living place all over the area to which he regularly came.”
But as for the churches, it is worrisome that the funds received from the sale of assets will not be long enough, no matter what their leaders trusted in. “Rano or late they will remain with nothing.”
At the place of the church, he added, a multifamily house would be available, whose inhabitants would not be able to support the remaining parishes in the area.
“The majority of buyers of these apartments will be white, ” Adams believes.
Both churches were constructed by white assembly before Harlem became a black region: Metropolitan Comunitis in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church 10 years later.
The first motivated methodist church left the coming in the 1930s of the last century.
Their building was bought by a black coming nearby.
When St. Martin's church came into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was organizing a boycott of stores on the 125th Street, the main commercial artery of Harlem where they refused to work or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged as a result of the fire, and during the reconstruction work, Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of the father of Johnson, who replaced him at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the carillon “poor colons for the poor”.
But the expert testing the carillon in July called it “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical instrument”.
An expert from the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that it was a carillon from St. Martin's Church that was the first in the world to play a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play a larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merriuezer, St. Martin’s church has not yet found a replacement for him.
The last few months around St. Martin’s church had a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom had been invited by secular leaders, others by the Episcopal Church.
The congressional council, the governing body of the parishioners, in July turned to the eparchy, expressing concern that the eparchy “will try to transfer the cost of work” to the parishioners, although the latter did not have to do with the choice of the architects and contractors directed by the eparchy.
Some of the adherents expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of transparency on the part of the eparchy.
In California, a shark wounded a 13-year-old diverger who was mining lobsters
Official sources reported that on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, a 13-year-old diverger in California had been attacked by a shark and had suffered bodily injuries.
The attack occurred about seven o'clock in the morning near Beach Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview of the KSWB-TV station (San Diego), on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends and about half an hour later heard the boy's cry for help, and with his friends, they sailed a boat to the site of the attack and pulled a teenager out of the water.
According to Hammeel, at first he decided that the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but he quickly “saw that he was shouting, ‘ I was bitter!
I have been bitten!"
As he approached the diver, Hammel observed that “he had completely ripped his skin around the key.”
"I yelled for everyone to get out of the water, "Here's a shark!"" says Hammel.
A helicopter boy was taken to the Radi Child Hospital (San Diego); his condition was assessed as critical.
The view of a shark attacking a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Guils, reported during the press briefing that a few weeks ago a shark had been observed in this place but had not been classified as dangerous species.
Guils also added that the victim was injured in the upper torso.
The authorities closed the zone from the Ponto Beach in Casablade to the Saami Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Gails noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to conquer Britain's perfumer and cosmetic market
Seinsbury is about to establish cosmetics and perfumeria offices in Bouts, Superdrag and Debenhems stores with cosmetologists, a model of luxury umbrella.
Britain's portfümer and cosmetic market is estimated at £2.8 billion and continues to expand, while sales are falling in the area of fashions and goods for houses, to capture a large share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 shops throughout the country, spaced cosmetics and perfumeria offices will be represented, and if success is expected in many other shops next year.
The owners of the supermarkets are looking for more than filling the shelves previously placed under television, microwave kilns, household goods, and investments in the perfumerous and cosmetic market are a good decision.
According to the representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to double the list of cosmetic products to 3,000; including for the first time, marks such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be proposed.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially selected locations, by type of organization of goods at Bouts stores.
In addition, the Boutik-Cosmetic Product Line will be reorganized with vegan products to meet the demands of young buyers.
Two Saintsbury shops will present perfumeral producers of Fragrence Shop, the first of which was already opened in Croydon in southern London last week, and the second is expected to be opened in Selli Ouk, Burmingham, this year.
The Internet trade and the tendency to buy a small amount of food per day in small shops near the house have led to the need for supermarkets to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, President of Seinsbury, says that the autlets will gradually turn into umbrella, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops like Aldy and Lidle, offering more services and non-food goods.
In hundreds of Saintsbury supermarkets, Argos outlets are placed, and some of them now have Habitats stores since the network acquired both marks two years ago, resulting in increased sales of food and sales from these purchases.
Previous attempts by a supermarket to give a new life to their cosmetic and pharmacy departments have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinsbury and Bouts was organized, but there were further differences between the participants on the issue of the share of income from the sale of pharmaceutical products in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury's pharmaceutical business (the entire 281 shop) of Selesio, the owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for £125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the plan by adding a broad luxury line to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Speaks Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director of Seinsbury: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfumeration and cosmetics divisions in order to create a more favourable environment for our buyers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with the Council.
Our markings will attract many visitors to the search for cosmetics and perfumeria, and it will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones reacted ragely to Holly Willowby's exit from a deal of £11 million sterling
The Star of the Dragon Lagos show, Peter Jones “disbursed” by Gollie Willowby's telecommunications from a £11 million deal that she intended to enter into with the Laifstile Brand Peter, but instead preferred new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint stamp of domestic clothing and Truly axes.
This couple's business was compared to Goop actress Guinet Peltrou.
The 37-year-old lead programme, “This morning”, announced its decision at Instagram.
The decision of Holly Willowby to leave their profitable Lifstile Brand to focus on new contracts with Marx and Spencer and ITV led to the anger of Peter Jones, the dragon Lagoon Star.
According to our sources, Jones was “disaggregated” when a telecommunications favourite during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlou, Bakingemshire, admitted that the cost of up to 1.5 million new contracts would not be sufficient for their common mark of domestic clothing and Truly accessaries.
Their stamp was compared to Gwinet Peltrou's Mark Goop, and it was expected that its sales would double the state of Willowby, estimated at £11 million.
The 37-year-old leader announced her departure at Instagram, but Johns himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “the Mark Truly was the main priority of Holly.
This was a long-term attachment that would ensure her careless existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led to the stage of all parties to the transaction.
Everyone was amazed at what took place on Tuesday, since the marks were held for weeks before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlou, there was a whole warehouse filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the leader ' s morning, one of Britain ' s most popular stars, could cost a firm in millions of pounds of sterlings due to significant investments in goods, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing, as well as potential delays in launching the line.
In addition, it is a breakdown of long-standing friendships.
The three children raised by Willowby and her husband, Dan Boldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years now.
Willowby created a Truly stamp with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company in March.
Both couples often spend vacations together and, in addition, they own 40% of the company's shares in TV production, Dan Boldoin.
Willowby will be the Ambassador of the M&S and replace Anthony McPartlin as the leading ITV transfer, “I’m famous”.
The source from the intimate neighborhood of Jones said last night, “We cannot comment on his business.”
Complex talks, “and then we fell in love with each other”
He had been chased about the criticism that would affect the media because of the “unworthy President” of the commentary and the positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump renounce such claims?
Said Trump, imitating the voice of the leading news.
"I didn't give up on anything."
He noted that Kim Chen Yen was interested in a re-study meeting, after Trump called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing the stockpiles of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have gone into an impasse.
Three months after the June Summit in Singapore, the high-ranking diplomat Li Yon Ho of North Korea addressed the world leaders at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, stating that North Korea is still awaiting “responsibilities” from the United States after the initial disarmament measures of the DPRK.
Instead, the United States, the diplomat noted, continues to use sanctions as a force of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“North Korea has a wonderful situation, ” he said.
“We were at the verge of war with North Korea.
Millions could die.
And now we have a good relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jung Yin had yielded fruit: the missile tests ended, hostages were released, and United States soldiers left in the DPRK also returned to their homeland.
Referring to his relationship with Kim Chen Yun, Trump stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy was not strange.
“Take yourself a good President, so easy, but then, instead of 10,000 people on the street that tear up in this completely slain hall, there would be only 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: catastrophic destruction recorded, victims counted as hundreds
In the first days after the Lombo earthquake, foreign NGOs said that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had lost their roof, the Government did not find it necessary to declare a national disaster, which was a mandatory condition for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they clearly made it clear that international support was not needed, so it was difficult,” says Celina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, but we do not know until we know whether a foreign group can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, official representative of the National Office for Natural Disaster Management, the Indonesian leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether to involve international organizations.
Given the persistent seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains appallingly poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters were constructed in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite warnings about the tsunami threat, there was no raw material to warn the population that most likely resulted in so many victims.
Transportation between the many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital previously docked in Lomboka to assist the victims of the earthquake is being sent to Palo, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidododo has made the strengthening of Indonesia ' s old infrastructure the main focus of his election campaign and has spent considerable resources on improving roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joco, who was balloting for a new term next year, was embarrassed with funding problems.
The President is also criticized for the aggravation of the interfaith strife between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
Over a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were killed as a result of collisions between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other jamheads.

Cromwell's monument to the Parliamentary Building gave rise to an aggressive discussion on “Rewriting history”
Cromwell’s exile would be a barbaric retaliation for the destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by its followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, the Cromwell Memory Society referred to Mr. Creek's proposal as “invasion” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmite, president of the Cromwell Memory Society, stated: “In the ongoing debate about demolition of historical monuments, the question of Oliver Cromwell’s statue was inevitably raised in the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell has nothing to do with the Iconocial Movement during the British civil wars.
Oliver Cromwell is likely suffering for the sins of his forefather Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Sir William Hamo Thornikroft, Cromwell, reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of the human being, which many still regard as worthy of respect.
In an interview The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmit stated: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell to be the advocate of Parliament against external pressure, in his case monarchy.
Whether this view could be considered historically accurate, it remained the subject of the debate of professionals.
But it can be said with confidence that the conflict that arose in the mid-17th century had affected the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was an important historical figure representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as the Lord of the Protector are also commendable and respectful.”
China's farmer's dead pigs
In one market in southwestern China, a farmer was a victim of pigs, and local media reported.
The bloody body of the victim (the media mentions only his name, Yuan) with the broken artery was found near the glue in the market in the Lupanshui province of Guichou in southern China, reported by the Morning Post on Sunday.
The leader is preparing to vaccinate pigs in the pig farm, 30 May 2005, the Bluein district of the Chinese province of Tsinghai.
Yuan and his cousin came from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs to sell.
The next morning, the cousin discovered the breathless body of Yuan, and the door to the nearby pig was opened.
The pig was in a huge cart with the blood on the throat.
During the forensic examination, it was determined that the pig weighed 250 kilograms of pigs killed the farmer.
“ My brother’s legs were bloody and crooked, ” said Guyang Evening News Woo, a relative of the murdered man.
The video from the surveillance cameras showed that Yuan had come to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed its animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the newspaper Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate cabin for the time of investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
It is reported that the Yuani family is negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of a farmer.
There are few cases of pig attacks on people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, U.S. state, by traumatizing a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal brought a Wallean peasant to a tractor and released, just frightened by a sub-sexed wife.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs, and, according to one Canadian farmer in CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “leave mechanism”.
Pigs of games,
They're bitter and very curious, but they don't have the purpose to hurt you.
You should simply impart to your animals a sense of measure and respect," he explained.
Rosa Hurricane will bring rains to a large part of the South-West United States
Hurricane Rosa is projected to lose its strength by moving through the cooler zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring rains and floods to northern Mexico and south-west the United States in the next few days.
As of Saturday, 5 p.m. in New York, the cyclone reached 1st category, with winds up to 135 km/h, 360 kilometres south-west of the city of Punta Euchenia (Mexico).
It is expected that Sunday hurricane will move north.
At the same time, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low-pressure zone that will travel east of the western U.S. coast of the State of Lower California, and will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico to the southwest of the United States.
More than 25 cm of precipitation is expected on Monday in Mexico.
The tropical humidity in the forming low-pressure zone will lead to strong rainfall in the next days in the South-West.
Precipitations between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rainwater, dirty streams and possible desert landslides.
In some areas, particularly in the south of the states of Nevada and Arizona, high tropical air humidity can increase from 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In selected areas of the south-west of the United States, mostly in most of Arizona's territory, up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden rapidly developing floods is not excluded by uneven distribution of tropical rains.
With the current risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert has serious consequences.
Livns can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and thunder can cause ravages of winds and raise the clouds of dust.
With low pressure on the coast of southern California, rainfall will fall.
It is possible to fall up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small dirty streams and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
These are the first rainfall in the region since the beginning of the rainy season.
On Sunday night and morning, the tropical rains in Arizona will take place on Monday night and Tuesday morning.
By Tuesday the rains will pass in the area of the Four corners and will be spent until the evening of the environment.
In October, temperatures across the United States will be sharpened, owing to the low air temperature in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
At times, such a combination leads to severe temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperatures will be particularly noticeable in central United States on Sunday.
There is a difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between Saint Luis and DeMonnes, Iowa, about 20 degrees.
During the next few days, summer heat will be accumulated and extended to other territories.
Most of the United States central and eastern territories are expected to have warm weather in early October, and the temperature will be up to 27 degrees from the South plains to the North East.
In New York, air temperature may rise to 27 degrees on Tuesday, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an extremely high temperature on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
Senate hearings in Judge Bretta Kavano ' s case over 20 million spectators
Bretta Kavano and Christina Blazi Ford, who accused Kavano of an attempt to rape in the 1980s, received the attention of over 20 million spectators of six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to the Cavano's approval had received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was made to the media: Jeff Flake Republican made a condition that the charges against a lawyer should be investigated within one week by the FBI.
As Ford stated at the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she “100 per cent” believed that the Kavano had attacked her and tried to sabotage her at the school party.
Cavano gave emotional evidence stating that 100 per cent were confident that this was not the case.
According to the research agency Nielsen, over 20.4 million spectators watched the Friday debate.
The Agency took into account average data from CBS channels, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account the audience watching TV at work.
For comparison, this is the average audience following the American football match in the Flei or the Oscar service ceremony.
The largest audience was Fox News Channel, whose leaders warmly supported the appointment of Kavano: the Senate hearings lasting all day looked at an average of 5,69 million audiences, reported the Nielsen Agency.
The second is ABC from 3.26 million audiences.
The CBS auditorium was 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC was 2.89 million, while CNN had 2.52 million views, reports Nielsen.
After hearing, the interest in the case was not weakened.
There was a real drama with Jeff Flake on Friday.
After the Senator from Arizona, considered a moderate republican, reported on his intention to support the candidacy of Kavano, CNN and CBS, the camera was captured, as on Friday morning, on his way to the meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake faced an elevator with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world has seen him dropping his eyes, getting a blow from angry women in a direct CNN air.
"I'm standing in front of you," said one of them.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
“You have the power, while so many women are powerless,” the woman has tried to explain her position.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would address it at the committee meeting, and the elevator doors were closed, hiding the senator from all over the cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve the nomination of Kavano as a judge and to send it to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast the meeting in direct air.
However, Flake made one condition — to investigate the FBI on the charges against the candidate by the next week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flake claims to have changed his view thanks to the intervention of a friend, senator from the Democrats of Chris Kunes.
He made a final decision by talking to Kunes and several more senators.
Fleuk's decision had the effect, since it was evident that the Republicans lacked votes to approve the Kavano without conducting an investigation.
The FBI decree of the President Trump opened an investigation into the charges against Kavano.
U.S. Prime Minister Teresa May accuses his critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview of the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Tereza May accused politicians who criticized her plan to leave the European Union that they put narrow-party interests above the interests of society.
The British Prime Minister is present at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published on the May interview, the former head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, criticized its so-called Shashes plan in Brexit, stating that he considered the introduction of customs duties between Britain and the EU to be “absolutely futile”.

The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of the shooting of Wade Syms, a 20-year-old basketballist playing for the University of Louisiana.
According to the Baton-Ruja police, Datheon Simpson was arrested and detained for the second degree of murder.
The police published a video of the fight with Sims and Simpson, where Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, CBS regional channel, the police discovered the DNA of the Simpson on the scores found at the crime scene.
During his interrogation, Simpson admitted that Wade was fatally wounded.
According to Advocate, the bail for Simpson is $350,000.
The coroner of the eastern Bahton Ruja district issued a preliminary opinion on Friday: death was caused by a cross-cutting firearm wound of neck and head.
The Division is grateful to the Division for Criminal Investigation of the State of Louisiana Police, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local residents who have assisted in expeditious investigations that led to detention.
Joe Alleva, Director of Sports of the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good work on the detection of the offender”.
Symsu was only 20 years old.
A two-metre forward was Bathon Ruja; his father, Wayne, was also a member of the Louisiana University team.
In the last season, Cims recruited 5.6 points and made 2.6 picks for the average match.
The team trainer Will Wade made a statement on Friday morning, saying that the tragic death of Wade Syms caused “sock” and “real woe” to all players.
"That's what I always feared," added the coach.
Volkán covered Mexico City's coat.
The Popocatepetl volcano fell asleep in the southern vicinity of Mexico’s capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention of Mexico recommended that the population not approach the volcano: 183 perished peragogaz emissions were recorded in its crater.
According to the Centre, vicinity of the volcano was often rampant and trembling.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochillo, social network users have published pictures of lobster glazing cars covered with thin ashes.
After the earthquake of 7.1 Mw, which hit central Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded the increased volcanic activity of 72 kilometres south-east of the capital.
The Popocatepetl Volcano (or, for its own, “Don Goo”) has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police collisions with Catalan separatists prior to the first anniversary of the referendum on independence
On Saturday, a multi-thousandsth meeting was held in Barcelona on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps, and there were no clashes between the independence of autonomy and the police; and six rioters were detained.
The police had pushed protesters to independence, while the last black masked had been thrown into detention by eggs and powder paint, raising clouds of dark dust in the very centre of Barcelona.
After the police took the trigger of the crowd, the riots resumed with a new force.
During the few hours, the advocates of independence scandated, “We don't forget, we don't forget, we're not easy!”
According to local press reports, fourteen participants were taken to the hospital with light wounds.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized as illegal by the Spanish Government, but was a milestone for separatists.
The Catalonia, with a huge peak, voted for leaving Spain, but the appearance was low because the opponents of exit were predominantly boycotting the referendum.
Catalonian official sources reported that in the last year, almost 1,000 people were injured in an attempt by the police to block a referendum at the polling stations of the country in violent clashes.
On Friday, separatists spent nights following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent its conduct.
The demonstration still took place, but it went another route.
The 68-year-old electricity Narcis Termes, who visited his wife's separatist visit, is struggling with the hope of acquiring the Catalonia of sovereignty.
“One of the most important events in our lives took place last year.
My parents wept for happiness, having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a weighed state,” he says.
In recent December elections to local authorities, Catalonian parties in favour of Spain ' s separation have won an important victory, even with a small breakthrough, but this year they lose supporters because many of the known leaders of the movement are either in flight or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in the organization of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puch, a 42-year-old mechanic recording police rallies, said that the conflict was heated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“Enhancing tension, ” he added.
On Saturday, Oriole Junkéras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, who have been held in a pre-trial detention cell since the end of the past year, announced his intention to be in the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next elections to the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government”, he said.
Londonderry: The car crashed into the house, all three co-parties arrested
One of the Londonberri houses was a number of cars, where men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested.
The visit was carried out on Thursday, about 19:30 local time in the Ballinagard Crescent area.

There's reports that a shot from the bow could be fired into the car.
Lingston's victory over Reingers thanks to the notion of the naked Mangi
The first head of Dolly Mengie brought a guaranteed victory to Livingston
Thanks to Livingston's slain ball, he won an unexpected victory over Reingers.
The exact impact of Dolly Mengie was equal to Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian Club in the table, where they divide the second.
The Jerrard Club was left without a victory at this premier League season, and on Sunday, they are to meet with the leaders of the Harts group, from whom Reingers stands behind for eight points.
On Thursday, Redgers will hold a field of the League of Europe match with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
Livingston's Club continues its unwindless series in the Division, playing six matches and has not been defeated since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as chief team coach.
Missing points for Livingstone in the rival guests
The training coach of Holt had to keep an account from the outset — the “eyngers” obviously failed to deal with their pressure.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of protection, but he was naked with his weak attempt, and then Alan Litgo's defender, swinging too wide, was unable to prevent Kayg Halkette's ball from getting on the grid.
The host allowed the Reingers to play before their line of protection, expecting dangerous moments when the game resumes.
That's how they missed that important nak.
Reingers retracted the free strike, and Lingston took the opportunity: the Declaration of Gallager and Robinson have made the transfer of Menge, which has slain from the central position.
By that point, Reingers had a superior position in owning the ball, but the protection of the host team was untested, so Liam Kelly was not concerned.
The second time was on the same pattern, although Kelly had to beat Alfredo Morellos.
Alan McGregor's leader, Allan McGregor, beat his foot off Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a wide-ranging presentation from the standard position.
Mys was constantly caught in the Livingstone fine, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two demands of the toolbars — one of the provocation of the Hlenn Meddlton Halkette spare player and the other by the hand — were not satisfied.
Livingston Funnel Game - analysis
BBC Scotland - Alasder Lamont, report from Tony Macaron Arena Stadium
A phenomenal game and a great result for Lingston.
Absolutely all the players were great, and once again they went beyond expectations, continuing to climb the soccer Olymps.
Their game style and composition have not changed much since they came back to the top of the rating, and the great merit of Coach Holt is that he's mobilizing this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes in his team.
Captain Halkette led an excellently organized protection, and Manga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Warorall relax.
Reingers could not enter the rhythm at all.
Although they had good game points with the Jerraard coach, this time they did not justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, they lacked the possession of the ball, but only one day they were able to protect the host team. “Rangers”, who had dropped at the middle of the table, had something to think about.
Erdogan ' s cool reception during the visit to Keln
On Saturday, on 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, there was a beautiful weather, and both the superiors were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO parties — a visit and already a conflict.
Heads of country were unable to find understanding on such issues as human rights, press freedom and Turkey ' s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to participate in the ceremony of the discovery of a huge new mosque.
Kelne is the largest Turkish diaspora living outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-thousands-to-four crowd to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan placed themselves nearby to see their President.
At the same meeting, the opposers of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurdas, met in a full voice to condemn both the Erdogan policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically contrary views at the meeting reflects the ambiguity of the figure: many Germans with Turkish roots exalted Erdogan, while others regard it as tyrant.
Deptford road accident: collision with the car led to the death of a cyclist
In London, a cyclist who died at the scene of the accident encountered a car.
An accident occurred near Becousud Street and Evelyn Street, a lively crossroads in the south-eastern part of Depfort, about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car and the cyclists who came to the site tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometres from the scene of the accident, on Childers Street Street, another cyclist was hit by a vehicle whose driver hid.
The London Police reports that work is under way to identify the deceased and inform his immediate relatives.
In the meantime, roads are closed and bus routes are changed: motorists are asked not to enter the area.
Long-Lartin prison riots: wounded six police officers
According to the Administration of Long-Lartin, six policemen were injured during the riots carried out in the male prison.
In the men's strict regime, Long Lartin (Wustershire) has continued riots since Sunday, which have been tied up to 9:30 local time.
To suppress the turmoil of eight prisoners from one wing, the opera group “Tornado” was called.
The police had suffered minor damage to the soft fabric of the person and had been provided with medical assistance on the ground.
According to the official of the prison, “in order to resolve the incident in the Long Lartin correctional facility, specially trained staff were recruited.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our establishment, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their preventive measure may be changed for a longer period.”
Long-Lartin currently holds more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had been hit by an inmate in the hospital.
Last October, the prison leadership had to engage a special-purpose unit in order to calm the inflammated prisoners who had thrown the billion balloons into the supervisors.
The Rosa Hurricane may flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the drylands)
Arizon rarely enters the intensive tropical cyclone, but this time it is “lucky”: at the beginning of the next week, Hurricane Rosa has to go over the desert part of the South-West and pose a risk of rainwater.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of rainwater floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east of the state of Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstuff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass through a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will be raining on Monday night.
The National Meteorological Service Office in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “a total of ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression in 320 kilometres of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 65 kilometres from the Arison border.”
According to the latest projections of the National Meteorological Service, it will fall from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, reaching 15 cm on the Arison Plateau of Mogollon Rim.
In other desert regions of the South-West, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Big Bassain, it is possible to fall up to 2.5 to 5 cm in precipitation and can reach 10 cm in precipitation.
For zones with streams on their side, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing because the region has long suffered from drought.
Although rainwater floods may pose dangers, heavy rains can facilitate dry seasons not occurring in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40 per cent of Arizona’s territory has at least a strong drought (second by gravity)”, reports the weather.com website.
Hurricane Rosa will first break into Mexico’s state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, a hurricane with a maximum speed of 137 km/h is 360 kilometres south of the town of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and travels north at a speed of 19 km/h.
Hurricane was found in a more cool water zone on the Pacific coast, thus losing its strength.
During the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of Tropical Storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rains are expected to take place with a threat of floods.
“In the territory from the Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, it may be up to 7 to 10 cm of precipitation, up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Then, hurricane Rosa will head north across Mexico and, on the morning of Tuesday, reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone, from Arizona to the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The underlying potential risk posed by Hurricane Rosa and his remains is associated with heavy rainfall in the Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and in the desert areas of the south-west United States,” reports the National Meteorological Service.
Precipitation is expected to cause dangerous rainwater floods, dirty floods in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.

Donald Trump: “The whole hatred, all the malice” of democrats in the Kavano
“The Voice for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by democrats,” said the Trump at the visit of his fellows in Wiling, West Virginia.
In the view of Trump, the Cavano ' s nomination for the candidate was “invaded by all hatred and all malice” by the Democratic Party.
On Thursday, Cavano testified at the United States Congress, categorically rejecting Christina Blazie Ford's accusation that he sexually gained her more than 30 years ago when both were adolescents.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that on that day, “the American people saw a brilliant mind, class, and courage”, Kavano.
“The Voice for allegation of Judge Kavano is a vote for the approval of one of the most prominent lawyers of our time, with an unpunished public service list,” declared the President of the crowd of his fellows in the state of West Virginia.
In his speech, the President indirectly raised the question of the nomination of Kavano, referring to the importance of the Republicans appearing for elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“Prior to the most important elections in our life, only five weeks remain.
I'm not part of them, but I'm involved in a race in another way," he said.
"I'm worn as hard as I'm fighting for our great candidates."
The Trump believes that the democrats have set themselves to “do our best to resist us”.
In accordance with the rules, the first key ballot in the Cavano Senate on the approval of the candidacy should be held no later than Friday, and the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party had informed.
The earthquake in Indonesia has claimed hundreds of lives and the total number of victims continues to rise
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, and many had been driven by giant waves by the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, which had been hit by an incredible force of tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Palu, and on Friday, the coast of the West reached waves of nearly six metres, which dared all on their way and led to the instant death of many of the present.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnetud on the Richter scale.
“When the storm warning was announced yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of fleeing immediately and thus lost their lives,” said Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo, an official representative of the Indonesian National Authority for Natural Disaster Management during a press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis did not come alone, there were cars, logs, whole houses, the elements destroyed everything on their way,” explained Nugrojo, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h and, with all force, collapsed on the coast.
Some of those present fell to the trees, saving their lives.
Approximately 16,700 local residents were evacuated in 24 shelters in Palu.
At the aerophoto survey of disaster management, houses, shops, bridges and mosques have been destroyed.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by underground pushes.
A series of earthquakes took place in the Territory with a population of 2.4 million.
The Agency ' s statement on the assessment and use of technology of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicates that the emissions of energy caused by the earthquake were about 200 times higher than those of a nuclear bomb destroyed by Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected by the geographical location of the city at the end of the long, narrow gulf.
Nugroho referred to damage as “majorous”, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, trade centres and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of the destroyed buildings, the bodies of the deceased were discovered; 540 persons were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho added that victims and destruction could be even more significant along the coast 300 kilometres from Palu, at the Dungala site near the earthquake episcenter.
Communications with Dungal were “full-destructed, no information received”.
“More than 300,000 people live in the Dungala area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already travelled to the disaster zone.
“The tragedy has taken place, but it is not yet a limit,” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it did not report the tsunami coming to Palu on time, but the authorities believe that the waves reached the coast as the initial warning was still in force.
Amateur video appeared in social networks where the man on the top of the building screamed about the tsunami coming, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water erupts on the shore, carrying whole homes and cars.
The Reuters Agency has not yet been able to confirm the sponsorship of this video.
Earthquake and tsunami have resulted in large electrical deterioration, causing Palu to lose contact, which has made life-saving operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft with humanitarian assistance were shipped from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuated populations still lacked food and necessities, and government sources reported.
The airport of the city was opened only for humanitarian assistance; it would be closed for other flights until October.
President Joco Vidododo's evacuation centres will visit Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision have safely arrived from Dungala to Palu, where the staff have found shelter in the tarpaulin tents broken in the yard of their office building.
“They have seen a great multitude of destroyed houses, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian assistance mechanisms, but many complain that experts from international NCBs have failed to reach Palu.
Indonesian legislation permits the attraction of funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the declaration of the site where the disaster has hit the national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster,” reports Aulia Ariani, the Spokesperson of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the Government declares a natural disaster to the national, we will be able to accept foreign assistance, but the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day of the natural disaster that struck Paul, friends and relatives of missing people still look forward to their marvelous salvation, which will restore the people to their faith in the best.
On Saturday, a little boy fell into a sewage hatch.
On Sunday, rescuers removed a woman who had spent two days there, alongside her mother's idle body.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of Indonesia ' s national assembly on paraplanerism, prepared two of the missing pilots for recent Asian games in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his disciples, including Mandaga.
“ I am not the last person in this sport, and emotionally it’s hard to survive, ” he said.
Hendon recalls how, when he learned of the collapse of Roa Roa from other paraplaners, he was desperate to contact his colleagues at Palu who were resting on the beach festival for the next hours.
However, his messages were shown with one grey head, not two blues.
“This means that the communications have not been delivered,” he believes.
Stolen burglary of $26,750 during banking in Newport-on-Livy City
On Friday morning, the thieves kidnapped $26,750 from the incassator Brink's, who runs one of the bankomats in Newport-on-Livy City, reported in the press release of the New York Police.
According to the investigator Dennis McCartti, the driver of the armoured microwave took the cash from the bathroom located in the entertainment complex and was about to fill it with new notes.
At that time, “the brink's staff member ran off his back and stole a bag with bank notes to fill the bankroad.
Witnesses reported that several suspects had escaped from the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information about these individuals are requested to contact the New York Police Office at number 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: Rapper changed the name Ye
Rapper Kanye West came up with a new name: Ye.
On Saturday in Twitter, he said, "Life formerly known as Canyo West."
41-year-old West has been wearing this pseudonym for a long time and even putting it in the name of his eighth album that came out in June.
The news of this came in front of Canya's transfer of Saturday Night Live, where he plans to present his new Yandhi album.
Kanye West will speak as an accomplice in place of Ariana's singer, who has revoked her participation because of “emotional experiences”, reports the author of the communication.
West had previously stated that not only was an abbreviated version of his name but also religiously meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, meaning you, you, ” so West explained the title of his album in a recent interview to Big Boy.
“ I mean, it's you, I'm us.
It was first Kanye, which means “one, ” and now I'm just Ye, that is, a reflection of all the good, bad, misunderstandings in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
Kanie's not the first famous rapper to change the name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deddy, P.D.D. or just Deeddy, asked to call himself Lav (love) or Braza Lav (Bratian Love or Brother Love).
Speaking with West Rapper Jay-Z, he also changed his name several times: with defis and without, inscribed letters or strings.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military forces against the civilian population
The President of Mexico, Andrez Manuel López Obrador, swore never to resort to military force against civilians in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration ending a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in the area of Tlatelolco, President Lopes Obrador promised “no time to resort to the assistance of the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On 2 October 1968, during the peaceful demonstration of the students, the first shots were fired on the crowd and a massacre of 300 people killed, which took place against the background of the strengthening of the left student movements in Latin America.
López Odrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship for training and the opening of more free State universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of education led young people directly into the criminal world.
The United States dollars need to be redoubled in financing the development of FDI
It should not underestimate China and its efforts in the area of artificial intelligence (DI) — the US — should redouble investment in its scientific development, according to Lee Caifa, investor and entrepreneur in the development of DIA with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Several United States ministries had previously made declarations of work on FDI, although the United States as a whole did not have a clear strategy for the development of FDI.
At the same time, China has submitted its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in innovations of the DI by 2030.
“Increasing the budget for research in the area of FDI would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are expecting the next breakthrough in the area of DI,” said Lee.
The increase in funding could double the chances of the next major achievement of FDI in the United States, said by Lee CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “University of Artificial Intellect: China, the Cremn Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the Director-General of Sinovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding FDI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that exceeded the highest player in the American Othello and was then headed by Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. governmental technological competitions, such as Robotics Challenge Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next competition would take place to help find people with non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to receive government grants.
“China does not absorb academic leaders, but corporations,” Lee believes.
Facebook, Google and other technological companies have been hiring lights from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policies can also help the US to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think Gren Cards should automatically be offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the Council of State of China published a plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides funding similar to that of the National Scientific Fund and other governmental organizations in the allocation of money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China below, says Lee.
Previously this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established the Joint Centre of Artificial Intellect, in which industrial and scientific partners should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intellect.
During this month, DARPA pledged $2 billion to the AI Next programme.
As for NSF, it is now investing over $100 million a year in the study of FDI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intellect has not taken any action in that regard for several months.
The Macedonians vote on a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday to the referendum on whether the title of their country should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”, which would resolve a long-term dispute with Greece, which blocked her application for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, asserts that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim for its territory and vetoed his entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments entered into an agreement based on the proposal of a new name, but nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the electoral appearance would meet the minimum of 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question raised for the referendum was as follows: “Are you supporting NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?”
The parties to the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the breakdown of Yugoslavia, should pay the price for joining such organizations as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it could live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Oliver Georgiewskaya, Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of Parliament stated that they would observe the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it was not legally binding.
The change in name would require a two-thirds majority of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13:00.
However, the appearance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the recent parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old José Thanavsky, voter from the capital of Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dusko, voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way for her accession to NATO and the European Union in Srumika, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
Prior to the Parliamentary Building in Skopje Vladimir Kavardkov, 54, prepared a small stage by laying chairs in front of the tents established by the citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We're for NATO and EU membership, but we want to combine with a high-ranking head, not with the thresholds of business offices,” says Kavadarkov.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
The Prime Minister of Zaev said that NATO membership would invest in Macedonia, which was so essential to that country, where unemployment was more than 20 per cent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be for, because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zayb after the vote.
He believes that a positive answer will be “the foundation of our well-being future”.
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Studies showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this was below the required phenomenon.
Another survey conducted by Telecom-TV, Macedonia, revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of that number claimed to vote positively.
For a referendum to take place, the appearance should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first major impact on the policy of the western Government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Serhio Aguero of Manchester City is circumventing the protection of Bryton to kill the naked.
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling were attacked with the protection of Bryton, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero slammed his head for the 65th minute, it seemed to him that he had nothing to do with it.
At the beginning of the episode, an Argentine attacker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He leaned between the three Breiton defenders before erupting into the open space of the United Nations.
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He crossed one defender and hugged several more at the edge of the Brayton penal zone.
Then he handed the ball to the left of Sterling.
An English attacker, while in the penal zone, turned Aguero's ball in one touch, who struck Matty Ryan's gate at the right corner with his right leg.
“Aguero is in trouble with the legs,” stated the journalists, the Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he's killed his head at that moment."
But it was Sterling that gave the Celestial Blue the original advantage in the fight of the Premier League.
That nak was beaten for 29 minutes.
At this game, Aguero received a ball, deep down in the territory of Brayton
He gave a great cut-off transfer to Leroy Sane on his left-hand flank.
Sane made a few salutations before giving Sterling a long-range trouser transfer.
The attacking Blue and Heaven-Blood ball was smashed into the gate just before it flew out of the field.
Manchester City fought Hoffenheim in the League of Champions on Tuesday, 12:55 at Rhine Neckkar Aren in Zingsheim, Germany.
Sheerzer is going to pick up the glasses at Collorado Rockiz.
After Washington Nashionals was out of battle for play-off, there was no particular reason to force events.
But she's hopeful to take over in the fight against Collorado Rockiz on Sunday, but only if Roquez, who is running one of the Los Angeles Dodgers games in the Western Division, will have problems in the playoff.
The victory of 5-2 over Neshionals on Friday night, “Rockise”, has already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they still hope to have a title in the first division.
“Although we play just this, we can at least hold our positions, knowing about the enormous significance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of the audience and the other team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss that?'
Nationals has not yet been declared a pitcher on Sunday, but it is recent that in this situation sheerser is more likely to be identified.
Sherser, who was going to go to the 34th game on Thursday, threw a ball on the piecher area, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he'd be a drinker.
The statistics for the right-washington drinker are 18-7 with ERA 2,53 and 300 autumn ratings at 220,2/3 innings during the current season.
The Temple conducts a pre-election race in Western Virginia
Referring to the importance of the Republicans in the intermediate elections, the President indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavano, a candidate nominated by the President to the Supreme Court.
“All we have done is mapped in November.
Five weeks remained to one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's very, very important, and I'm not running, although I'm really running around fighting for good candidates," he said.
The trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see that this is happening right now.
And they are determined to return power, using all the means necessary, and we are witnessing vileness and disgustingness.
They don't care who they're going to hurt, who they're going to cross to get power and control, that's what they want -- power and control, but we're not going to give them."
The Democracies, he claims, had sought to “continue resistance and obstruction”.
“And you have seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democrats “wicked, mean, vile and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Legal Committee, mentioning the Democrat Senator Diann Fainstein, which caused loud voices from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you let this document leak?
Hmm... uh... what document?
No, no; the tongue of the body delivered it; I have never seen the tongue of the body so refusing the words."
The Leiborist Party is no longer an organization that has different views.
It is not tolerant of those who express their views
When Momentum activists in my local party made a proposal for an octopus of distrust to me, that was not surprising.
In the end, I am the last in a number of members of Parliament from the Laborist party, who has not yet been told that we are not welcomed for expressing our views.
The same is true of my colleague Joan Ryan in Parliament, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, my mistrust was criticized for dissenting with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policies, national security, Europe ' s irony of destiny are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Laborist Congregation notified on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of the time I had been in the ranks of a local member of Parliament from the Laborist party, the Friday meetings of GC were the same.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not in line with the many meetings, but the promise of “more human and soft” policies has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that the Leiborist Party is not allowed differences of views is becoming increasingly apparent and each opinion is evaluated as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political prospect I had previously considered similar to my own began to expect that I would radically change my views and take a position with which I would never agree — whether national security or the single EU market.
Every time I speak publicly — no matter what I say — there is a tyrand of insults in social networks calling for an abolition of elections condemning the policy of the centre or claiming that I should not be a member of the Laborist party.
And that's not just what happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the commentary on me still tends to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who face daily attacks on sexual or racist soil, but never give up.
The most disappointing thing in this policy is that such a number of insults has become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin stated that the Liborist Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “wide church”, and with every octopus of mistrust or change of choice the party is becoming.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling on me to sit quietly and to talk more slowly, and then I will be fine.
But I didn't come into politics for that.
Since I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, as a student of the school, disdained by the Government of Tetcher, which caused my school class to literally break apart, I have tried to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need most — whether the work of the local deputy or the government minister.
I have never concealed my political views; I have not done so in the past elections.
No one in the Notting East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this October, I would like to say that our country is so hard to move towards Brexit, which will guarantee economic, industrial and public damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
But, in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters, whether they are leiborists or not: I am proud of what I am serving you, and I promise that no threat or political feasibility will prevent me from doing what I think is necessary in your interests.

Er 38-17 Melrose: The Inevitable Er comes first
Two late attempts, perhaps somewhat distorted the final outcome, but Er no doubt earned triumph in this amazingly interesting tennant Prime League match.
They are now headed by a table, the only invincible team of tens.
Eventually, all because of their excellent protection, as well as their ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Murchi the full right to be satisfied.
“All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad, ” Peter Murchi commented.
Robin Christy, Melrose: "Advanced Er," they tried better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, carried out by Frezer Climo, led Er forward, but the yellow card issued by Scottish player Rory Hugou made it possible for Melrose to move forward, and Jason Baggot took up an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the "Er" break from a fine before, right in the middle of the game, earned a score and then interrupted a solitary attempt by making an account of 17-5 in favour of "Er".
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Rouarid Knott, and after the re-emergence, Er moved further through the attempt by Stefford McDauel, implemented by Climo.
Blair McFerson, the current captain of Er, then received a yellow card, and Melrose again forced rivals to pay the next player for an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of a violent period of pressure.
Nevertheless, the owners returned, and when Struang Hutchinson received a yellow card for the interception of the Climo without a ball from a punitive line, McFerson made a tachdown behind the coming mole Er.
Climo had exercised the advantage without stopping almost from the re-entry, after Kyle Rou had been struck by David Armstrong and had sent the extreme attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the landowners.
Star still Game is going to start a new career in a restaurant business
The Star Still Game Ford Kyran is going to start work in the hotel industry: it was known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor performs the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script to which he writes, and is filmed together with the long-standing comic partner Greg Hemfield.
Duette announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last one in the show, and it seems Kiernan was planning his life after Craiging.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The acter refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan was planning to participate in the “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgo.
“Our Moore: Bolivia, landlocked, hopes that the Court will reopen its way to the Pacific Ocean
The seamen patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Societal buildings have blue flags.
The Navy bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are painted with a slogan: “Our world is right.
It is our duty to return it."
Throughout Bolivia, the landlocked, there is still alive memory of the coastline lost in favour of Chile as a result of the 19th-century bloody conflict, due to resources, and the desire to sail again through the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have become the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and mental balance and, of course, expects a positive outcome here, ” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians would observe the decision-making process before the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal would be able to support Bolivia's statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile was obliged to negotiate a sovereign landlocked Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of the indigenous peoples of Bolivia, who has fought a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also awaiting a decision on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he asserted at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not be in favour of Bolivia, and if so, it will make little difference.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to manage the Chilean territory and has already stated that there will be no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments had been heard suggests that the case was “not complex”, said Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert on international law.
For the past four years, Bolivia has not proceeded, but it has been postponed for the rest of the time.
“Bolivia's new administration has had a crimeful problem with access to the sea,” said Zarata.
She said that the military rhetoric Morales had destroyed the last Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will then be extremely difficult to discuss.
These two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Velce, representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court decision was rendered too quickly.
The Monday will bring Bolivia “the exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the chance to end 139 years of differences with mutual benefit,” he asserts.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the naval problem as a political lure.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific,” he claims.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure that we have to pass through our past.”
North Korea states that nuclear disarmament will not be achieved until it can trust the United States
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, states that his country will never go to destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments are made as the U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo gradually turns to the path of resumption of impasse nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Yin.
Rhi claims that the long-term sanctions and objections of the United States to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever be put on the knees of the North is utopia.
Washington fears to approve this declaration if Pyongyang does not take any significant steps on disarmament before.
And Kim, and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold the second summit.
However, skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's rejection of an arsenal, which the country probably views as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion show the newest line of massive head coverings that promise to appear in the mass sales, and they'll be held right next to you.
If you want to add hats to your collection or completely protect yourself from sunlight, there's no need to look for anything else.
Valentino and Thom Browne presented a bunch of unusual headfits, which are part of their SS19 collection and blind visitors to the fashion week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical hats won the popularity of the subscribers instagram, and designers decided to send their snoggly creations to the podium.
Valentino, a copy of the Valentino, was painted on the model head by a large field of feathers.
Other massive axesures included jewelry ornaments, a magic hat, and even ananas, but all these head coverings are not intended to warm their head in the cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fascinating masks, which had to become very predetermined by Hellowin.
Many of these petty masks had their mouths sewed up, and they were more like Hannibal Lectur's portrait than the creation from the kangur.
One was like a submarine with tube and protective points, while the other was a growing ice ice cream.
If you're a fan of high fashion, you're lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge hats have every chance to get into mass sales — right to you.
The gigantic patches go to the heels of La Bomba, a straw hat with a two - foot - wide field, which everyone had already worn, from Ryanna to Emily Ratakovska.
The Cultical Libel, which released this extremely impractical hat, which has gained so much popularity in social networks, has created and sent to walk on the pilgrimage another huge axeswar, a straw beach bag, almost as large as the one dressed in the purchasing model carrying the bag.
The orange bag of the burned rafia with a white leather handle and rafia was a brilliant copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection in Paris.
“I think large hats and beach bags will appear in the mass sales of the next summer, and since the designer has made such a furor by his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge axes.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is of great importance to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was reaffirmed in 2018: the outstanding results of the examinations demonstrated individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are enrolled throughout Scotland, and are seeking to provide the highest level of services for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further higher education, their chosen careers, as well as the status of the world ' s citizens.
As part of the education sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of the individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, you call his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, you turn to his heart."
This is a powerful indication that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build relations with and trust the citizens of other countries.
On the basis of the recent examinations of this year, we see that the languages hold leading positions in the League tables and have the highest score of independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received the highest “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (China) while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent in French and 63 per cent in Spanish were also “A”.
This proves that, in Scottish independent schools, foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital to children and young people in the future.
Currently, language subjects have the same demand as natural science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the educational programmes of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Training Commission in 2014 revealed that 17 per cent of the reasons for the employers' difficulties in filling vacancies were lacking in language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student will choose if he learns the second language, in the future he will gain a real advantage by gaining another additional skills that he will benefit throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person with a number of foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a survey by YouGov, in which more than 4,000 British adults participated in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak in a foreign language sufficiently to support the conversation, while the French language was the only language with a double percentage — 15 per cent of respondents.
That's why investment in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a greater chance to find a good job.
In Scotland schools, there is quite a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has a set of languages.
A number of schools are concentrated in more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered most important to Britain in the light of the country ' s future development by 2020, such as Mandarine or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a choice in independent schools from several languages with teaching staff, whose members are specialists in these languages.
The independent schools of Scotland seek to create an educational environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills they need to succeed, regardless of what the future holds for them.
At present, it is impossible to deny that language remains vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country, so that this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages should indeed be seen as “the skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director, Scotland Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts Likers on Sunday in San Diego
The Tomful expectation of fans to see Lebron James speak for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers is nearing a close end.
Luc Walton, a lecturer in Lakers, announced that James would play a pre-session Sunday match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
But there is still a need to figure out how much time it will have to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eighth, ” Walton replied on the official Lakers website.
The reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, wrote in Twitter that James was likely to play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for about six pre-session games in Lakeers.
“I don’t need pre-session games at this stage of my career to prepare for the season,” the player answers.
West Virginia Pre-election Trump Race, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of pre-election meetings tonight in Wiling, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of the Trump next week, including the friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since the vote on the candidate he proposed for the high judge was postponed, the Trump seeks support in the forthcoming intermediate elections, for the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote is to take place in November.
How long will the Trump meet in West Virginia tonight, and how can I see it online?
The Temple meeting in Willing, West Virginia, will be held today, on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Trump meeting with Western Virginia's voters online on a direct YouTube broadcast.
The trump is likely to address the hearings that will take place this week in order to nominate his candidate Brett Kavano to the position of supreme judge, and the proposal by the Trump of the candidacy has caused a number of negative reactions, as the Kavano was accused of sexual harassment and the vote to be taken at the Senate will be postponed for a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main goal of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase the pre-election pace.
Thus, the campaign of President Trump aims to ensure that the five meetings to be held next week help “intensify the activities of volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, writes Reuters.
“The Congress is so important to his agenda that the President must visit as many states as possible, since we enter the tense electoral agitation season,” says Reuters, the Spokesman for the electoral campaign, who refused to be called.
An action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Wiling may attract supporters from “Ogaio and Pennsylvania, and bring to the attention of the media Pittsburgh”, reports West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday's visit by the Trump of West Virginia is the second visit to that state in the last month, for it was here that it had gained more than 40 percent in 2016.
The trump is trying to help the Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is lagging behind the results of the surveys.
“The fact that Morrisi must come before the interviewers is a bad sign for Morrisi himself,” said Simon Heder, a political scientist from the University of West Virginia (Reuters).
Ryder's Cup 2018: U.S. Assembly shows the willingness to fight and the hopes of going on Sunday for couples.
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturday game two for two may have been exactly what the Raider Cup needed.
The transitional initiative is an exclusively invented sports concept, but it is believed by players, and it is particularly strongly expressed in such competitions.
So who has the initiative?
“They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I suppose this is a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Spitty of the departure.
Of course, Europe has four points, and 12 more on the horse.
The Americans, according to Speaker, feel the wind in sails, and they have reason to keep the spirit up, not least because of the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them can have three points of four.
Sleep was inclined from you to gren, than was a personal example.
The winning voices were getting louder as his round continued, stirring the decisive ball into the hole, shutting the match when Thomas and I got back two by two.
His blow, which gave them a victory in the 15th moon, was met with a similar voice, one of those who say that he believed in a chance for the American team.
“We need to gather ourselves with all our strength and focus only on our own games,” Spit commented.
That's all the players are left now.
It's 18 moons to be the winner.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who undoubtedly entered the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe have beaten four out of four, and it seems they don't know the mistakes.
Muliwood was the only couple who did not take the blasphemy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the blasphemy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and, again, Friday morning.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and the irrational fans, strengthens the belief that they will not be won on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the Le Golf National horizon, there will be no more famous player who has won the potential victory of Europe than Flitwood or Molinari.
It'd be great if both were on different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to speak of the glory of Europe.
Boubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly broke up with Serhio Garcia, the morning hero of four balls when he was in pair with Alex Noren.
And the gods and the two double gods in the first nine holes dug the Spanish, and threw the pit out of which they could not get out.
So no one's gonna help you get out of your hole on Sunday.
It is fascinating to watch four balls and four players play because of the interaction between the couples, the councils they exchange and the ones that deliberately silence, and how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe has so far played better as a team, and has gone a long way forward on the last day, but this session of the Quartet has also shown that the US collector has all the forces to fight, in which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day, the Ryder Cube is the leader of Europe with an account 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup following the end of the Saturday matches with four balls and four with the advantage of 10 to 6 over the United States.
Inspired duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two winners on Taiger Woods to bring the account to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return the lost trophies in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the mistake that the American team made in the morning games of four balls, winning the 3-1 account.
The United States was more resistant in the Quartet, winning two matches, but it was unable to reduce the account gap.
Jim Ferick's team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophies.
Flitwood is the first European novel who won four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, who received the name “Mollywood” after the sensational weekend, became only the second pair that won four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
By putting Woods and Patrick Reed into four balls, they then brilliantly joined together to win the spirit of Woods and the American novel Bryson Dechebmo with even stronger 5/4.
Woods, who passed the two Saturday matches, showed periodic lights, but now he lost 19 out of 29 balls of four and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested in front of the morning game of four balls, returned to Henryk Stenson's partner in Quartet, winning Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepke, accounting for 2/1 and holding the first and third seats in the world.
For Europe, the game was not an easy and pleasant walk of refreshing day south-west of Paris.
The three-fold Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas earned on Saturday two points were a guide for Americans.
They have won a decisive victory with an account of 2/1 over Spaniards John Ram and Ayan Polter in four balls and have returned later to play Potter and Rory McLroya with 4/3 in Quartet, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had the team left behind four points, leaving alone, given that the Ferick team had to play as hosts to keep the trophies.
However, after two days of retention, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it's at the verge of their ability.
North Korea said that “category” would not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions reinforced the mistrust of the United States and that his country would under no circumstances renounce its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho stated at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “imaginable goodwill measures” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear weapons and the obligation not to build stockpiles of nuclear weapons or to develop nuclear technology.
“We don’t see the same symmetrical reaction from the United States, ” he said.
“No confidence in the United States will be assured of our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able unilaterally to take the lead in disarmament”.
While Ri has reiterated the North Korean complaints of resistance to Washington in a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for gradual steps, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denucleization without control, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yen and Donald Trump at the first summit in history between the US President-in-Office and the North Korean leader, held in Singapore on 12 June; Kim promised to begin a movement towards the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and the Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea was seeking to formally complete the Korean War from 1950 to 53, but the United States stated that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to calls for weakening the severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists that “there must be denuclearization,” and increases pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its goal forcibly and even object to the “announcement of the end of the war,” said Ri.
“The idea that sanctions can kneel us is the Utopian dream of people who do not know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions increase our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader, Moon Je-In, held in the last five months, and added: “If this issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been in such a deadlock.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri was sharply different from that of the last year when he said in the UN Gena Assembly that North Korean missile targeting was inevitable after Mr. President of evil Trump called Kim a “Self-Bower” attacker.
This year, in the United Nations Tramp, which last year threatened “full destruction” of North Korea, commended Kim for his courage in adopting disarmament measures, but said that much remained to be done, and sanctions must remain in force until North Korea was disarmed.
On Wednesday, the Trump said that it did not imply any time frame for the process: “Whether it will take two years, three years or five months is irrelevant”.
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
However, the U.S. Secretary-General Mike Pompeo said to the Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and mandatoryly until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unanimously reinforced the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to discontinue the financing of Pyongyang ' s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri in the Kuluars at the UN Genasamble Summit and informed after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo's been visiting North Korea this year three times, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours of the visit, North Korea condemned him for the “bandite requirements”.
North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex as well as the nuclear complex if the United States, for its part, took “appropriate measures”.
According to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he referred to were security assurances that Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest at special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all primary students learn more sleeping and to combat the chaovinist culture of uninterrupted consumption of caffeine to keep awake at night.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he considers to be the first in his country in the United States.
After his opening, he began to take such a course in advance with a report on the impact of lack of sleep on learning processes.
“At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, ‘I'm really sorry that I've learned about it just now that I'm almost finished learning.'
She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — what surprised me, ” he told the Telegraph.
The course offered for the first time this year describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sporting performance, as well as how it improves the general sense of human beings.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the executive director of the University ' s Health Service, said that the university had decided to introduce this course after it was clarified that the students had severely lacked sleep during the training week.
It lasts for one hour, and the students perform a number of interactive tasks.
In one section of the class, it is proposed that the classroom be pictured where students, pushing coffee cups, curtains, coachers, and books, receive information on how each of these activities and substances — coffee, light — and the lack of sleep — affect sports results and the importance of getting sufficient sleep on a daily basis.
In another section, participants will learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
The online map of the Campus encourages participants to think about their everyday lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how any other person has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health,” added Professor Chasler.
He said that a false sense of pride that a person can “flee all night” is still prevalent, and modern technology, just as increasing pressure on students, means that deprivation of sleep is a problem.
He said that a sufficient amount of good-quality sleep was a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, nerve depletion and anxiety, and even to combat overweight, since underdrinking puts his brain into starvation, causing him to suffer a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian researcher on chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler to develop a course by attending a class last year during his first year of study in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to disseminate this information throughout the campaign.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all graduates to have a similar curriculum before entering a competitive school.
Professor Chasler recommends that students establish a clock to warn them that they should sleep and wake up, and that the effects of the blue light, emitted by electronic screens and light-driven lamps, which violate human biolitics and cause problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Reingers: Goll Menga wins the Jerard team
Reingers survived another sad visiting meeting, as the naked Dolly Manga led Stephen Jerard's unfamiliar team to defeat the 1.0 count in Livingston.
The Ibrox team was hoping to win their first victory after winning the count of 4:1 in February in St. Johnston, but Gary Holt only defeated Gerard's 18 games as managers, leaving his team eight points behind, giving him a light victory to the Harts, leaders of the Scottish Premier League.
Manga was killed seven minutes before the break, and the Greengers, who had lost the spirit, apparently didn't intend to balance the account.
While Reingers is now in the sixth place, Livingston has risen to a third place, and has only given Hibernian a ratio of slainheads.
And Reingers may have additional problems after Calum Spence, a liner, had to heal a head wound after an item was thrown out of the guest sector.
Jerard made eight replacements on the team that went through Er in semi-final for the Scottish League Cube.
In turn, Holt went along with the same Libya 11 strategy, which increased the Harts gap last week, and he would be pleased to see his well-forced composition tightening the opponents at each step.
Reingers may have been driven to own a sword, but Lingston was pushed out much more when the ball came to them.
They were supposed to kill their head in just two minutes when Manga Scott Pittman's first transfer stopped Allan McGregor, but the semi-defense took the chance.
Kigan Jakobs carried out a punitive attack on the captain of Craig Halkette, but his defence partner, Alan Litgou, was able only to send the ball towards the far-reaching trouser.
Reingers has intercepted control, but the last third seems to have had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he had to strike a fine for forty-fifth minute when he and Stephen Loles met, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not accept the Colombian statement.
Reingers only struck two times in the first time, but the former gate of Aibrox, Liam Kelly, was unlikely to be concerned about the blow of Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak blow by Ovi Ejariya.
Although Libya's first naked at the 34th minute may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it exclusively by their own work.
Again, Reingers failed to cope with Jacob's standard game.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher gave Scott Robinson's ball to him who was trying to pass the ball to Manga for completion.
Gerard began to act in a break when he changed Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately resulted when the extreme semi-defenseer gave passes to Morellos, but the impressive Kelly drifted off his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to the game they intended to play with Litgou and Halkette, constantly making long transfers.
Holt's team tried to increase the break in the final phases, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgou handed over the field.
Reingers, Glenn Midddlton, once again demanded a punitive strike after he met Jacobs, but Thomson refused again.
Almanah: Heiger ' s inventor
And now the page of our Almanah Sunday morning: on 30 September 1882, 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger has developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Being one of the foundations of science, Geiger's counterpart also became one of the foundations of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s Colokola Coronado film, with cowboylike Rogers and Dale Evans — these seemingly unlike scientists — in the main roles:
The man, "What kind of thing is this?"
Rogers: “This is the Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can really hear the influence of atoms generated by radioactivity in minerals.”
Evans: "Here, now it's all right!"
Geiger died in 1945, not only a few days before his 63th anniversary.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" anomalous cells
A new anti-Ballistic vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” anomalously growing cells and kill them
Part of the treatment of vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize anomalic cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in the laboratory conditions
As a result of this change, the cells are able to “see” the type of protein, characterized by many cancers, and then the cells must be reintroduced.
The test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
One patient who had introduced this vaccine and whose immune system had learned to recognize anomalous cells, the cancer of ovaries has been in the process of remission for over 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and to change them in laboratory conditions, after which the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, which are common to many cancers, and then reintroduced cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Vifeda, Maryland, states: “The results that we received inspire have a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer”, including breast cancer, ovaries, lungs and color cancer.
Similar techniques have been successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia, which was to collect immune cells from patients and their “education” as to the effect on cancer cells.
Kanie West spoke in defense of the Trump in the MAGA hat after his arrival in SNL.
It went bad.
Kanye West was a sanctified student during the Saturday concert, at which he spoke in defense of President Donald Trump of the United States, claiming that he would reoccupy this post in 2020.
After carrying out his third song entitled "The City Ghost", which he had dressed in the Cape "We Make America Great Again", the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported the Tempa.
"Very often I talk to white people, and they ask me, "How can you support the Tramp, he's a racist?"
Well, if I had been concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time," said the performer.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matthew Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood Star ridiculed Brett Kavano ' s testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee on Christina Blace Ford ' s allegations of sexual harassment.
Television did not show how the crowd was upset by West, but this video recording was downloaded into social networks by Comic Chris Rock.
Now it's not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that he was being ridiculed behind his bullets.
"They've been screwing me up behind the stage.
They say don't go out in that hat.
They really fucked me up!
Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “And they also said that my position was not cool.”
West continues: “Would you know that it's not cool, put on a superman's cloak so that no one can tell you what to do?
Then you need love."
His comments, at least twice, attracted the attention of the audience, the SNL actors seemed bleak, and one man said to the publication, “The whole studio was plunged into silence”.
West was invited to replace Arian Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, Raper McMiller, died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the I Love It song in the Perrier bottle suit.
West received support from the head of the TPUSA Conservative Group, Kendis Turner, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the most daring people: SPACIBO FOR THE Mно-MULTURE.”
The leader of the show Karen Hunter wrote in Twitter that West was simply “the one who he is, and it's perfectly wonderful.”
“But I do not want to support anyone (purchase his music, clothing or other support for his creativity) who, in my view, shares and disseminates the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
Like us,” she said.
Prior to the beginning of the raper show, the Twitter was announcing that he changed his name, claiming that he was now “formally known as Kanye West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow the footsteps of Deaddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague Rapper Snoop Doga originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, of course, a newly legended performer, Prince, who changed his name in symbol and then in the name of an artist formerly known as Prince (Prince).
Attempted murder because of the laptop in the Belfast restaurant
The 45-year-old man was accused of attempting murder after one of his visitors died of knives injuries in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballihakamore, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Kit Harington's Throng Games Star attackes toxic masking
Kit Harington is known for his role as the waving sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy HBO “Crown Game”.
However, recently, a 31-year-old actor has strongly criticized the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such characters often impress young people on the idea that to be respected, you have to be cruel.
In his interview The Sunday Times Culture Keith said he believed that something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masking in the #MeToo age.
Keith, who recently married his co-worker on the Throne Game, Rose Leslie, his peer, admitted that he was “very unevenly uneven ” to this problem.
“I personally take this question quite seriously: Where have we been wrong with the perception of courage?” the actor asks.
“Why do we teach teenagers that we have such a problem to date?”
Keith believes that television can be partly guilty of toxic courage because of too muscle characters.
The acter continues: “What is inherent and what is acquired?
What does it teach on TV and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they have to show just one aspect of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and the question is, how can we change this?
Because there's something wrong with young people today today.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any quills or Sikvels of the thrones, after the series ended the next summer, stating that he had “end the battalions and horses”.
Since November, Kit will play a major role in Sam Shephard's re-engineering “The True West”, describing the film producer and his brother, a robber.
Actor recently announced that he believed that the meeting with Rose's wife was the best final for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life, ” says the actor.
Rose played the Igrust, an object of passion for the character of Keith John Snow in a fantasy series awarded to Emmi.
The couple observed the wedding in June 2018 in Leslie's name place in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens who have been infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people are suffering from these diseases in the country.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been sexually transmitted, as evidenced by a change in trends in the past.
Traditionally, HIV has been spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of the transfusion of contaminated blood.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way has been almost zeroed by the Chinese health representatives at the Yunnan provincial conference.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexuality is a serious problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decrimalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Research confirms that 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual contact with men are eventually married to women because of the conservative values of the country.
In many cases, the transmission of diseases is due to the insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses information on the leakage of the senators of the Republican Party, complaining of “a dangerous lie” and “the theory of conspiracy”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected the charges that one of her staff had provided personal information to the three U.S. Senators on the Wikipedia of Legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the claims have been falsified by “ultralright” experts and websites.
“False, liar and even more liar,” says Waters in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the U.S. home addresses and phone numbers of the Senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on the Capitolian Hill during the hearings of the Senate Commission on Prosecutions of Sexual Harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Bret Kavano.
The leak took place some time after three senators interrogated Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and Red State, reported that the IP address identifying the source was connected to the Waters office, and published information on Waters staff, reports Hill.
“This unreasonable allegation is absolutely false,” assures Waters.
“My staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent actions, have in no way been accountable for the leakage of this information.
This unreasonable allegation is a complete lie.”
Waters' statement promptly led to criticism on the Internet, including by former Spokesperson of the White House, Ari Flascher.
“It is a rage denial, ” says Flascher.
“This means that the author has a temperature that is not suitable for work at the Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why should you be angry?
You don't need to justify yourself either.
And we shouldn't look into the motives of the prosecutors either.
We must remain calm and cold.”
Flascher seemed to compare the reaction of Waters with the criticism of the democrats against Judge Kavano, who was accused by critics of being too angry during the hearings on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republicans who was balloting at Waters in the intermediate elections, also expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
“If this is true, it is very important, ” he writes.
In a statement by Waters, her office warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent acts.
“We will ensure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they bear legal responsibility for all their actions that may be destructive and dangerous to all and to each of my staff”.
Johnny Inglisch strikes again -- weak pharmaceuticals at Rhoen Atkinson's spy.
Today, Brexit is a tradition of looking for meanings in any new film in which Britain is somehow represented; this is also true of the new parodian spy franchise, Johnny Ingish, whose production began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the "Agent Johnny Ingish: Reloading".
Will the self-ironic picture be with the Leitmotive “obviously that we are all crap”, a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the obsession profane Johnny Ingish with a rubber face has received his right to chaos for the second time — his name is most strongly suggesting that it is a broad-rank comic creation designed for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, a dumb secret agent who, despite his fascinating claims for glamorous mosquito, received a little Cluseau, Mr. Bin's traits and the party of this guy who made one single note in the tune of the Fire Chariots in London in 2012 at the Olympiad opening ceremony.
Initially, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveller and the mysterious international Atkinson, who once played in Barclaycard's now forgotten television advertising, in which the hero left a full chaos behind.
This last JE has one or two nice moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingish approached a helicopter dressed in mid - age armor, and the slogans grazed on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson to physically perform comedial scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strange to surplus, especially because such “serious” movies as“Agent 007” and “Missia incomplete” are now confidently proposing comedy as an element.
The feeling that humor is designed for children, not for adults, and for me the fabulous abuses of Johnny Ingels are not as ingenious and appropriate as the Atkinson faculties in Mr. Bin's movies.
The standing message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Kiber-hacker got into the supersecret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of a security agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, had an episode.
It's the last drop for the Prime Minister, the haughty and violent figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything he can to the character of Quasi-Tereza-May, but there's nothing to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since each active spy was compromised, she will have to withdraw someone from the resignation.
And here on the scene is Johnny Ingish's own person, who now works as a schoolteacher at some panty institution, but also provides informal lessons of secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, because Ingilch offers the skills of the spy Academy in the "Rock" style.
Ingliss returns to Whitehall for emergency training and reunites with his ex-wondered buff, who is played by Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is under the command of the submarine commander, the role of the “весy hokkee blade” in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because her Majesty's secret service has made terrible mistakes, and they're confronted with the beautiful rocky woman Ophelia Bulletowa in the execution of Olga Curilenko.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously exposed to the charisma of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems, Jason Volta, who is played by Jake Laysey.
Inglish and Buff begin their odysse of farsse jokes: frozen under waitresses, they ignite a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves into a luxurious Volta yach; Ingish produces a complete anarchy, trying to use the virtual reality garbage to get to know the Volt home interior.
All these scenes are, of course, a nice and embarrassing fiction, but there's something very childish about it.
Completely moderate things.
And, as with other movies, Johnny Ingels, I couldn't help but think, can the British movie industry give Rohen Atkins the role, really commensurate with his talent?
Leiborists deny that they are developing a workweek reduction plan for Britishs to four days in five days' wages
The Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, is going to consider a radical plan for British to work four days a week, but pay in five days.
The Party is said to want company managers to give savings to workers as a result of the revolution in artificial intelligence, providing them with additional weekends.
This would allow staff to enjoy three days of weekends for the same wage.
Sources reported that the idea was “incorporated” in the party's economic agenda and would help the population to take sides with the workers.
The Trade Union Congress approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from a changing economy.
The high-level source of the Laborist Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen at once, but a four-day working week is our goal, which is in line with the party's approach to changing the balance sheets in the economy in favour of workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party”.
The Leiborist Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party has promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the majority of the Laborist party is currently not supported by this aspiration.
The representative of the Laborist Party said: “The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered by the party”.
Tenev Chancellor John McDonnell used a conference of lieborists last week to specify his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnel said that he was determined to break the power of the non-personal directors and speculators of public firms.
The plans of the shadow chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water can not recover their entire share, as the Leiborist Government can make “exemptions” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and the establishment of Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10 per cent of private sector firms to workers who could receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 minutes," whether the FBI investigation of the Kavano can change their opinion
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Bretta Kavano held a final vote on his appointment as High Judge for at least a week and asked whether the findings of the agency could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kavano.
In an interview shown on Sunday, Scott Pellie, correspondent for 60 minutes, took an interview with the republican senators of John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether the FBI could find something that would make them change their opinions.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
'Of course,' Kennedy replied.
“ When I went to the meeting, I said that I was talking to Judge Kavano.
I called him after this information came into effect, and I asked, "Did you do it?"
His response was decisive, determined and unambiguous.”
But Graham's voice remained inevitable.
“I have made a firm determination with regard to Brett Kavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by the power of action comparable to that of dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I know is that Brett strongly denied all of this,” added Graham, referring to Christine Blace Ford.
“No one who was called as witnesses was also able to confirm these facts.
That story has been 36 years old.
I didn't notice anything new in it.'
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival (Peace Citizens) will be held this Saturday in New York, an annual musical event involving an impressive star composition with an astonishing mission — the end of poverty throughout the world.
For the seventh year, as many as tens of thousands of people have been leaping into the large grassland of the Central Park, but not only to enjoy the performance of such performers as Janet Jackson, Kardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to describe the present objective of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Festival of Peace Citizens, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of the global project to combat poverty by an international group of human rights defenders, hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to obtain a free ticket for an event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you have to participate in volunteer activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a telephone call or perform any other or other significant action to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the World ' s Citizens festival been in 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of remunerating people a free visit to the concert really convince citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “cultivism” when people believe that they make real changes, signing online posting or sending messages in Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers state that since 2011 there have been more than 19 million “actions” carried out by its supporters, which have pursued many different goals.
As a result, world leaders have pledged more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
In early 2018, the group issued 390 commitments and announcements that had been made as a result of its actions, at least 10 billion dollars of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is the The Power of Nutrition: the British Partnership of Investors and Employees to “Assist children in full capacity”, has promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, which has been done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the Government of Great Britain, donors, national Governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices over past history”, said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The Group also stated that, after more than 5,000 actions had been taken to encourage Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the Government had announced the funding of the “Food Force” project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the often asked questions on the festival website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen organizers respond: “This will be a long and difficult path on which we will occasionally stumble and fall.
But as in the great movements for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Wikend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Jeanel Mone, are some of the artists who will attend this year's event in New York and who will be the leading Deborra-Li Ferness and Hughe Jackman.
The United States is able to use the Navy to prevent Russian energy exports: the Minister of the Interior
The U.S. Minister of Interior Ryan Zinke stated that Washington could “as necessary” seek the assistance of its navy to prevent Russian energy transfers to markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russia ' s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate Government, is a pretext for new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And according to the official, there are some ways and means to deal with this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of the seaways and, if necessary, the blockade to prevent their energies from marketing,” said the Minister.
Zinke addressed the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group, which stands as the U.S. energy consumer's voice.
He further compares Washington ' s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective fuel use and replacement,” says the Minister, calling Russia “a ponti with one trick”, whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
Statements were made that the Trump Administration had set the task of increasing the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe by replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials of the Trump Administration, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” project of the North Flow-2 pipeline, which, according to Trampa, made Berlin a “happer” of Moscow.
In Moscow, on several occasions, it was stressed that the North Flow-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's violent resistance to the project is due to economic causes and is an example of unfair competition.
“Acknowledging that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Minister of Energy of Russia, Alexander Novak, following a meeting with the US Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, held in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has given rise to a negative response from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists, in the face of the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to keep away from EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When the third State intervenes in our supply of energy, this poses a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), following the recent meeting of the Chancellor of Germany, Angels Mercel and President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will examine carefully the possibility of presidential balloting in 2020.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would carefully explore the possibility of presidential balloting after the intervening elections.
At a City Duma meeting in Holioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the electoral race.
“It's time for women to go to Washington and reconstruct our broken government, and for that, a woman needs to go upstairs, ” says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I shall consider carefully the possibility of presidential balloting.”
Warren appreciated the work of President Donald Trump during the meeting: “Takes this county in the wrong direction”.
“I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy, ” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Tramp itself and his candidate for the position of Chief Justice Bretta Kavano.
In its Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before proceeding to vote.”
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that most voters themselves do not think it should be balloted in 2020.
According to a survey by the Centre for Political Studies of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the “like” voters in Massachusetts stated that the senator should not be balloted.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support its plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other known names of democrats discussed in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Baiden claims that he will make a formal decision by January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Paylin told me about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Paylina at a meeting with the electors of Donald Tramp.
Trek Paylin, 26, entered the army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday evening
“My son, who has returned home, is now suffering the same as other families who have suffered the consequences of PTSD and who have been wounded, and our soldiers return with wounds,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Talls, Oklahoma.
Paylin called his arrest a “bloom on the eye” and said of her son and other veterans of war: “They are returning to others, inclined, asking questions, and whether the same respect is shown to their companions, soldiers, pilots and any other military force they have shown their country”.
Trak Paylin was arrested on Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, and was accused of family violence against a woman, in a situation of violence and possession of weapons of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states, Colombia, support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts of Colombia support the legal challenge to the new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to victims of escape or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 states and districts filed on Friday in Washington with an analytical note by the court consultant on support for the asylum-seeking policy.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace against Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August is not disclosed against federal policy.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons in a criminal group” had subjected her to ill-treatment, but on 20 July the U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have submitted a large number of applications for asylum in the United States as countries facing widespread problems of criminal and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked the decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board in 2014, which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without documents to escape domestic violence.
The Attorney-General of Colombia, Karl Rasin, in his statement on Friday, stated that the new policy “is ignoring the decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“The Federal Act requires that all applications for asylum be dealt with on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and that prohibition violates this principle,” states the report of the judicial consultant.
Counsel also argues that the policy prohibiting the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, emphasizing that this type of citizen is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, the Attorney-General, Jeff Sashnes, ordered immigration judges no longer to provide asylum to victims of domestic or banditry violence.
“The shelter will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sasins in his statement of 11 June.
This instrument has never been designed to solve all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save people to Palu: the number of deaths doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming increasingly difficult.
“It is now very difficult, ” says Rice Kusum's 35-year-old mother, comforting her sick baby at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Accelerate relief brings the wounded every minute.
Clear water in a large shortage.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospitals affected by the 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a spine and shoulder break, rested at the Army Hospital of Palu, where patients were treated in open air because they were forced to leave the premises because of the continued strong impulses.
He cries when he recalls the severe earthquake that destroyed the number in the hotel on the fifth floor that he filmed with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm stuck in the wall breaks, ” says Haris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the town for the wedding.
“ I heard my wife crying out, asking for help, and then there came silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are saved, and now they are all right."
United States Ambassador accuses China of “inheritance” through “promotion advertisement”
A week after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page advertising in the United States and China daily, Ambassador of the United States in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the Payroll Supplement of Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper edition in the state of Iowa, in charge of China in an attempt to intervene in the U.S. Congress elections held on 6 November, which China denies.
The Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to intervene in the U.S. elections is evidence of the fact that U.S. officials reported to Reuters: a new stage is coming in Washington's growing pressure campaign on China.
While for foreign Governments it is the norm to place advertising for trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of the trade war, resulting in an equalization of tariffs for imports of their countries.
China's response tariffs at the beginning of the trade war had the task of impressing exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Party of the Tempa, Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, United States Ambassador in China and former long-term Governor of Iowa, a large agricultural exporter to China, claims that Beijing damaged American workers, farmers and business.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in Des Moines Register in Sunday, “now doubles this digestion, spreading propaganda in our own free press.”
“In distributing its propaganda, the Chinese Government uses our dear American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press, paying and posting advertising in Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“At the same time in the newspaper cyos here, on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear different voices and see no true diversity of views the Chinese might have learned from China’s alarming economic policies, since the local media are under the strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers had been “too baptized” from the proposal to publish its article, although it had not given the exact title of the publication.
Analysts warn: Republican women are being pushed away by Kavano before the intermediate period.
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain side-sided and defend the candidature of Supreme Judge Brett Kavano, despite several allegations of sexual violence, and analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially on the part of women, which may affect the upcoming intermediate elections.
Emotions around this situation have erupted to extremes, and most Republicans have officially stated that they wish to continue their voting.
Such things should not be returned afterward, ” writes Grant Rier, a professor of political science at Maxwell’s University of Siracus, in his Saturday article.
Rier doubts that attempts by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to investigate the FBI in the last minute will be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it tomorrow nor in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the MoveOn newspaper Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters scanded “November ahead!” against the Senate, when republicans controlling the Judicial Committee decided to nominate Kavano, despite Dr. Christine Blace Ford’s testimony, reported Mic.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scope,” stated Stue Rotenberg, a non-party politician on the news site.
“ People say that the situation has already erupted, and that’s true.
But everything can get worse, especially in terms of women voters in suburbs and young voters, between 18 and 29 years, who, although they do not like the President, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the candidate for the high judge in accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts had assumed that if the Republicans confirmed the nomination, this step could lead to a response.
“It is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of the past week, reports NBC News.
“It is not only about the voting of the committee or the final ballot or whether the Kavano sat on the bench of the defendants but also about how the republicans deal with it as they relate to it,” said Gay Cesil, Director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to select democrats, the news channel.
Nevertheless, the Americans seem to have split up a few on the question of who, though, is Ford or Kavano, and a little bit more inclined toward the latter.
The new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony accurately or most likely, while 35 percent say they believe the Kavano exactly or most likely.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kavano was likely to be lied or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to Flake FBI, the charges against Ford are currently being investigated and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramires, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford under oath witnessed to the Senate Legal Committee that Cavano had attacked her when she was 17 years old when she was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the high judge showed her his genitals at a party during the Yale University in the 1980s.
A World Wide Web inventor is planning to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that claims for competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last technical legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access to what information.
In an exceptional interview, Fast Company Berners-Li told him that the Inrupt purpose is to gain world domination.
“We must do this now, ” he says about his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, cases, as well as calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools for data management.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify -- everything can be used in one browser at the same time.
The unique personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by a user who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal empowerment through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the Inrupt idea is that the company has provided resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to all.
Currently, the company consists of Berners Lie, Brussels, the security platform, purchased IBM, several staff developers contracted to work on the project, and the volunteer programmer community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lie said that he and his team weren't negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether his companies should make major changes that would make all their business models completely different at the same time.
“We do not ask their permission.”
In his post on the Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “the Inrupt Mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid”.
In 1994, Berners-Li converted the Internet by creating a consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the Berners-Li vote was quite influential in the debate on neutrality on the network.
Even when launching Inrupt, Berners Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet, ” says Berners Lie.
Bernard Vann: A church servant awarded by Victoria cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one war priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for participating in the attack on Bellengliz and Leukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military reward.
The commemoration was solemnly opened by his two grandchildren at the Rushden parade, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was “very symbolic” that the monument had been opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather had received the reward.
According to the London newspaper of September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann spent his battalion across Saint Kanten channel “in a very dense fog and under the heavy fire of field weapons and machine guns”.
Later, he threw himself on the fire line and led the group forward with the greatest courage, then with one hand threw the field gun, hitting the three soldiers of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just more than a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of hero Michael Wang said that “he wouldn't be able to do the same heroic thing, but it's dying.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Wang, also laid a vein at the end of the parade led by the imperial youth orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Wangn said that “it is an honour to participate in the parade” and added that “the plausibility of the true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people.”
The MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead they were shown to the Peppe pig.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night to see full Bellator 206, but you didn't get to see the main event.
The San José table contained 13 fights, including six major programme fights, which were broadcast all night in direct air on 5 British television channels.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Musashi and Rori McDonald were preparing for the meeting, British fans were shocked to see the Spring Peppa screens.
Some fans were not impressed with this because they had not slept until the morning just to see the battles.
One of the Twitter fans called this change of broadcasting to a child's cartoon “a sick joke”.
“A public decision was issued that this content was inappropriate for six o'clock in the morning, so they had to be moved to child programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President of the Bellator on Marketing and Communications when asked why it happened.
"Yeah, "Swild Peppa."
President Bellator Scott Coker said that they planned to make a schedule in such a way that future fights could also be seen by audiences from Britain.
“In the case of re-display, I think we can solve this issue,” said Koker.
"But there's Sunday, six o'clock in the morning, and we can't solve this until Sunday, and for them this will be Monday.
But we'll do the best.
Believe when the broadcasts were changed, a bunch of text messages swelled, and they were not all friendly.
We tried to solve this problem immediately, thought it was a technical failure.
It turned out not to be a matter of public importance.
I promise you this won't happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans, we're trying to increase that quantity, but we've got a refurbishment.
Yes, it was wrong.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inappropriate because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic Dyver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse at all because of his sexuality, but that's what gives him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete told me that he did not realize that “not all are like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first programme of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Lavern, he said that he spoke of the rights of gays to give others “hope”.
He also said that his victory on the Olympics became less disturbing after he had a child.
The permanent multi-year leader of Kirsti Young took leave for a few months because of his illness.
Daley, who was the chief guest in Laverna's programme, said that he felt “more petty than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and for girls.”
He relates: “To this day, these feelings of negligence and inappropriateness have been very real, but they have given me strength, and I have succeeded.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something he meant” to avoid disappointing everyone when they eventually learned of his sexual orientation.
The two-fold Bronze Olympic Medalist has become a well-known LGBT activist and, in its presentation at Commonwealth Games in Australia this year, has called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed his opinion because he was fortunate that he had been able to live an open life without consequences and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-fold champion of the world said that his feelings for a man, the American director, Dastin Lance Blake, whom he met in 2013, “had caught him off guard”.
Last year, Daley married the Oscar laureate, who was 20 years older, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
“If all that is happening in your life in such a young age, ” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it is difficult to find a peer who would have the same very opposite experience.
A couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that “the whole world's vision” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win the gold medal," says the athlete.
"But you know what, there are things and more important than the golden Olympic medals.
My Olympics gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want to accept his death, and one of his last requests was tickets for London 2012.
“I couldn’t tell him, Dad, you're not going to be there, and you can't sit there in the first row, ” says Daley.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing, I finally realized that he was not invincible, ” says the athlete.
Next year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won Bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I've dreamed of all my life — diving before a crowd of people in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling, ” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small, which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still enjoys him so much.

Mikelson, not in uniform, held this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
The American Phil Mikelson will set the record on Sunday, playing his 47th match with the Ryder Cup, but he'll have to pull up his uniform to avoid a bad mileage.
Mikelson, who played at the binnal on the record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Fürik on the bench on Saturday for four balls and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, the five-fold large winner divided his day between the monitoring of the game and the work on his own game on the field, in the hope of correcting his concerns.
Never had the most direct stroke, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the Le Golf National rifle, where the long ruff usually punishes for inaccurate blows.
And if the course itself is not enough scary, Mikelson, at the ninth match on Sunday, will meet the exact champion of the British Open Franco Molinari, who joined the new man, Tommy Flitwood, to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in 12 solitary games make a fair start, Michelson's match may be decisive.
Ferick expressed confidence in his partner, though what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role entrusted to him today, twisted me on his back, hugs me, and said that tomorrow he would be ready,” he commented.
"He's pretty sure of himself.
He's a glorian Hall, and he's done so much for these teams last week, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's the way it was, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with all."
On Sunday, Mikelson will beat Nick Foldo's record by the number of matches in Ryder's Cup.
This can mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mikelson has 18 winners, 20 defeats and seven others, although Ferik said that his presence had a great benefit to the team.
“He's funny, sarcastic, fascinating, likes to assign people, and he's a great guy to whom he's interested,” he explained.
“ I think this week young players had fun with him, and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game."
Captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that a great advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, in his experience knows that a significant solitary leadership in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavourable side.
Danishin debuted in a match in 1997 in Walderram, where a team headed by Severiano Ballesteros had five points above the Americans, but had reached the finish line just a little ahead of the smallest difference, winning the 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You continue to remind yourself that we had a great advantage in Walderram; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Walderram, where we won, but just so far,” said Bjorn, photographed after the 2018 class, winning the Le Golf National field at 5-3, both Friday and yesterday, which resulted in 10 to 6.
So the story will prove to me and the whole team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you'll be full.
Go and do the right thing.
Until the glasses are put on, nothing is over.
We have a goal, and that's the chance of winning the trophies, and that's what we need to focus on.
I didn't say a word, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know so well that we are against the greatest players in the world.”
Enjoying the way his players spoke on a frustrating golf field for them, Bjorn added: “I would never have exceeded that.
We'll have a different test tomorrow.
Individual speech begins tomorrow, and that's a different case.
It's always nice to be with a partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you're feeling all your strengths as a professional golfist.
That is the point that players need to be inspired to put themselves in full tomorrow.
The partner is now behind it, and it must also make every effort.”
Unlike Biorn, his rival, Jim Ferick, believes that his individual players will be better off than their partners, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who have received three points out of four.
Ferick himself went through all this carousel of the last days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before he finally lost Europe when he spent the Medina Crude.
“I remember every damn word about this,” he said in reply to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, united his players before the last day.
“We've got 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to finish all of this more quickly as in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When the initiative moves one way, it puts great pressure on the middle of the match.
We built our plan for a game accordingly and set up the guys as we thought it was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was asked to try to lead the resistance by meeting Rory Macilroy at the top-master with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Iyan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I chose this group of guys, and in this order, because I believe that they will thus overturn all possible shortcomings,” said Bjorn, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The introduction to the operation of the new German military ship has been postponed
The newest frigate of the German fleet was to be operational in 2014 to replace the aged military ships of the cold war, but this will not occur at least next year due to the failure of the systems and the lavino price growth, local media report.
Introducing the Reinland-Pfalz, the main ship of Baden-Württemberg, which is now postponed until the first half of 2019, reports the newspaper Die Zeit with reference to a military representative.
The ship had to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen since delivery had made the fate of an ambitious project more difficult.
The four Baden-Württemberg ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be replaced by the older Bremen frigates.
As far as they are aware, they will have a powerful gun, a number of airborne and anti-corrupt missiles, as well as some of the technologies of radar, infrared and acoustic signaturs, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic.
Other important characteristics include longer service periods, which should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
Nevertheless, the continuous delay in the deployment of ships means that the most modern warships that are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad are already obsolete by the time they are going to arm, notes Die Zeit.
A malicious F125 frigate was posted in the newslines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the ship after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for return, but German media referred to a number of critical “programme and hardware defects”, which made the military ship use use use use useless.
The software deficiencies were particularly critical, as Baden-Württemberg vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 seafarers — only half of the labour force in old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship is too heavy that reduces its productivity and limits the ability of IMF to implement future updates.
It is believed that the 7000-tonne Reinland-Pfalz is twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to malfunctioning equipment, the cost of the entire project, including training of the team, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached an impressive €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems of retention of the newest fregates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings on the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament Defense Committee, recognized that the naval forces had “extended the stock of ships capable of deployment”.
The ruler said that the problem had become worse over time because the old ships had been withdrawn, but no vessels had been replaced.
He said that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregats could be taken into force by a fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mice
A new study carried out in one of the sites of Scotland’s Horlands has the task of showing how flying mice use the landscape to find food.
It was to be hoped that the data received would allow a new look at the behaviour of unique winged mammals and would help to further conservation activities.
A study by Scotland National Fund will examine common natopsites, non-topyers soprano, and the brown long-wheeled long-wheeling mice and nights of Dobanton, who live in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registries will be installed in some locations to monitor the operation of volatile mice throughout the season.
NHS and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys of the area using manual detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all records will determine the frequency of screaming as well as the activities for which the different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the habitat will then be drawn up and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their conduct on the scale of the landscape.
Rob Duar, NTS Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main areas of the management of habitat, such as the formation of meadows, as well as the ways in which forests can be maintained, the best for volatile mice and other related species.
The population of volatile mice in Scotland and throughout Britain has declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat of disappearance because of construction and devils that affect their habitat and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities may pose a risk, as well as a fly band, chemical processing of building materials and the hunting of cats.
In fact, flying mice is not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to fishing.
They use complex echo-location techniques to definitely identify the obstacles to the flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, are very serious about the population of volatile mice.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, retreat checks and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even established the first and only reserves in Scotland for flying mice in Threave in Dumfrice and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of Scottish flying mice live.
The real estate manager, David Thompson, says that the property is an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Threave, is a great place for flying mice," he says.
“There are old buildings here, many old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about flying mice remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need for a well-being.”
He recalled the importance of testing the existence of mice before maintenance within private ownership, since the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 females and young people, perhaps even the destruction of the entire local population.
Summer mice is protected by law, their destruction, the digestion or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scotland Scotch Officer of the Flying Mice Conservation Fund, calls on the public to help.
She says: “We have much to learn about our flying mice, and we just don't know how many species live.”
Ronaldou denies the charges of rape and his lawyers are going to bring a German journal to court.
Krishtian Ronaldou denies the charges against him of rape, calling them “feight news”, and claiming that people would simply“ want to pedagogize” using his name.
His lawyers are going to file the case with the German news magazine Spiegel, which issued charges against football.
Forward of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, which was allegedly in Las Vegas Hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, reported on Friday to Spiegel.
Instagram, where a football subscriber of 142 million, a few hours after the charges were reported, Ronaldou, 33, called this information “foot news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all the fairy news, says the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They just want to play with my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, saying my name, but it's just a part of their work.
I'm a happy person, and I'm fine," adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldu lawyers are prepared to submit to the court for the charges they called “unacceptable information on suspicions of confidentiality”, according to Reuters.
Counsel Christian Scherz stated that the player intends to seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of a legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is alleged that the alleged incident took place in June 2009 in the hotel number Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After acquaintance with the nightclub, Ronaldou and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in an analogue, according to the documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga argues that after the alleged incident, Ronaldou fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent good guy but fell by one percent”.
The papers claim that Ronaldou confirmed that a couple had sex, but that was mutually agreed.
Mayorga also claims that she had turned to the police and that her injuries were photographed at the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt “the fear that she would be retaliated” and feared of“public humiliation”.
A 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change the place of residence as she continued to experience traumatic feelings resulting from the alleged incident.
Ronaldou was about to join the Real Madrid in the Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to the Italian Yuve giants in a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain will “regret for the permanently lost autoproducers”
The Minister for Business and Enterprise, Greg Clark, stated that Britain would “regret on it for all time” if, after Brexit, the world leader in car production had lost his status.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK had reported to BBC that if Britain withdraws from the EU without transaction, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could result in job loss.
The Bernaston Construction produces Toyota Auris and Avenis, and last year it produced nearly 150,000 cars, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if Britain withdraws from the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed fears of withdrawing from the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, states that it will close the Mini Manufacturing factory in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to autoproducers, if there is no Brexit supply chain transaction, the supply chain will be placed at high risk.
Toyota ' s production line is launched “precisively on time” and the cars produced for orders are provided by British and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If Britain departs from the EU on 29 March without transaction, there may be riots at the border, which, according to industry representatives, may result in delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks in its factory in Derbishire for more than one day, so production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that the plan of Teresa May, which had been described in Chekers, on future relations with the EU was “practicably calibrated to avoid these checks at the border”.
“We need a deal, and we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, again, not only to succeed now but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said in the BBC programme of Radio 4 “Today”.
“Not only Toyota but other producers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to specify the time limit for the production, but in the longer term warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately reduce employment.
Peter Zuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the leader of a factory trade union, says that the concerns of members of the organization are growing: “In my experience, if we lose those jobs, we will not be able to return them.”
The representative of the Government said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Tramp meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to the White House information.
The responsible meeting of Donald Trampa with the Deputy Attorney-General, Rod Rosenstein, may be “transferred to another week”, since the struggle for Brett Kavano's can be pursued to the position of supreme judge, stated the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser, Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia ' s interference in the elections, the relationship between the Trump assistants and Russia and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
Whether the Trimp of the Deputy Attorney-General was dismissed, thereby jeopardizing Müller's independence, in Washington for many months had caused a lot of speculation.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of a wire to record talks with the Trump and the ability of the President's impistence through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein dismisses this information.
Last Monday, however, he had gone to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
The Trump said that he would not have dismissed Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid collision with the Senate Judicial Committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blace Ford, had testified.
On Friday, the Trump ordered a weekly investigation of FBI complaints in Kavano, which further delayed the full vote in the Senate.
Spokesman for Trump, Sara Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of the meeting has not yet been appointed, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events in the Supreme Court”.
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed."
Some journalists contest this claim: Sanders has not briefed the White House since 10 September.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the absence of briefings was not due to “a contempt to the community” of television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing publicly”.
She suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press should be increased.
“The President holds more meetings to respond to journalists than any other president before him,” she added, without citing the exact figures, “We have these numbers”.
Sanders assured that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it is much better than talking to me”.
We are trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we have held in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, this is a decent replacement for the press briffings.”
The trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with high-ranking persons.
The conference is rare for the press at all.
Frivolous and sometimes strange Presidential behavior before the journalists gathered this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health is writing to EU employees in Scotland about the fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health addressed the EU staff working in Scotland to express appreciation for the country and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Jin Freeman, MSP, addressed this letter to staff members less than six months before British departure from the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of status declarations for EU nationals working in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “In the summer, negotiations between Britain and the EU on exit continued and this autumn should be reached.
However, the British Government also strengthens the preparations for a possible scenario with no transactions.
I know that this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wish to reiterate my appreciation for the contributions of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Collectives from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the health services and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercromebi undertook an emergency operation on head injury
Michael Authority from Tennessee reported that the semi-defense defensive of Tennessee Tigers, Christian Abercromebi, had undergone an emergency operation in the Saturday after the strike of 31 to 27 in the Vanderbilt Commodores match.
The state chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed stated to journalists that the injuries had been received shortly before the break.
“ He went to the side line and just broke down there, ” said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromebi oxygen on the sideline before putting it on the wear and medical examination.
The state official of Tennessee told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Neshville, Tennessee, that Abercromebi had an operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the type/stage of injury is available”, and Tennessee seeks to find out when the injury occurred.
For Abercromebi, who had only entered the second course, it was the first season of Tennessee Steit, after moving from the state of Illinois.
On Saturday, before losing his game, he successfully grabbed five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay higher herb fees for the purchase of real estate in Britain.
In accordance with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be charged with a higher sealing charge for the purchase of real estate in Britain and additional funds will be used to assist the homeless.
This step will result in the attempts of Corbin to attract young voters
Higher herb fees will be charged to those who don't pay the tax in Britain
Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year in favour of the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged with higher herb fees for the purchase of real estate in Britain, and additional funds will be used to help the homeless will now be announced to Teresa May.
This step will result in the attempts of Corbin to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
Increasing herb fees would be charged to individuals and firms not taxing in Britain, and the additional funds thus provided should stimulate the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
An allowance for existing herb fees, including an increase imposed two years ago for the acquisition of secondary housing and rental housing, could be up to three per cent.
Treasury expects this step to provide up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estates are not purchased by British residents, leading to higher prices and complicating the task of buyers who acquire their first housing to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many of the elite areas of the country, especially in the capital city, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was developed a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction of herbal gathering to help a larger number of young people acquire their first home.
He accused major construction firms of screwing up real estate prices, earning land but not actually using them, and called on Ms. May to renounce the quotas on affordable housing to correct the “disdainable situation of housing” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms, which would include control over rent and end unfounded evictions.
It also wishes to give local governments more authority to build new houses.
Ms. May stated: “ last year I said that I had dedicated my Primeity to fulfilling the British dream to make life better with every new generation.
This, among other things, means addressing problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and live here.
However, it is unfair that the acquisition of real estate is as accessible to non-Citizens of Britain as well as foreign companies as to labour-loving British.
For too many, the dream of acquiring a home has become too far, and the threat for some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to control Scotland”
The boss of the Sunderland Club, Jack Ross, says that his “end-purpose” is to be at a certain stage the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the restoration of the North-East Club, which is now the third-most in the first league, separated by three points.
This summer he moved to St. Mirren's St. Lite after he returned to the Scottish Prime League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, and everybody," said Ross Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“ But I grew up watching my father and Scotland as a child in Hampden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this will only be possible if I become a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, the managers of Sunderland were also Dika Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardais, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gas Poyet and Paulo Dy Canyo.
Former manager Alloa Athletic says that he did not experience awe before such authoritative names in such large clubs, previously renounced Barnsley and Ipswich Town's proposals.
“For me, success at this time will depend on whether I can return to the Premier League.
In its structure and capabilities, this club is undoubtedly a premier-liga,” says the coach.
“Take him there is a challenge, but I will take it that I have done my job, only if I can return to the club.”
Ross is only three years in office as supervisor, initially as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spending 15 months at the Hearts Coach Headquarters.
He then helped Alloa to rise from the third level and, in the next season, led St. Mirren out of the bottom position of the championship winners.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever during his Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It must have been a real intersection,” he recalls his responsibility in Alloa.
“ I sincerely believed that the manager was more appropriate than the game.
It sounds weird, because I did everything well, well, well earned this job and achieved some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There's a lot of things you need to do weekly.
I still feel stressful at work, but I feel good at managerial positions.
I have always wanted to lead, and now, in doing so, I feel the most comfortable fish in water throughout my adult life.”
You can hear a full interview at Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September, on Scotland radio from 12:00 to 13:00 on English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 is the ideal time for pints of beer
Summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but reduced sales in restaurant networks.
According to statistics, sales in pubas and bars rose by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, who received this statistics, says: “A long-term solar activity, as well as longer than expected, England’s participation in the world championship means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs grew by 2.8 per cent, and restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.”
The June decline in earnings in restaurant commerce by 1.8 per cent also continued in July.
Pabs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results in restaurants.
Pavs selling only food were also affected by the heat of the sun, although not as much as restaurants.
It's like people want to jump outside just to miss a glass.
The sale of beverages in pubs and bars grew by 6.6 per cent per month and food by 3 per cent.”
Paul Newman, an analyst RSM on leisure and hotel business, says: “The results continue to be the trend that we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and impact of large social or sporting events remain critical factors in the market market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to be difficult, since the fall in sales by 4.8 per cent in annual calculations will be particularly painful due to continuing price pressures.
A long, hot summer has proved to be more than ever for the food operators, and it is not yet the fact that August, by bringing more moderate temperatures, will provide much needed rest.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of brands.
Industry sales monitoring of Coffer Peach Tracker in the British Pubs, bars and restaurants are collecting and analysing data on productivity of 47 networks with a total of over £9 billion sterlings and is a recognized sectoral benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from his parents.
According to the survey, every fifth child, some of them only 11 years old, has secret accounts in social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools revealed an increase in the pages of the Fecking Inst.
This news raised concerns about the content of a sexual nature
Twenty per cent of students said that they had a “core” account known by parents
However, 1 in 5 children, some of whom are only 11 years old, create social networks that they hide from adults.
The survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of instincts for feces, i.e., the Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news raised concerns about publications of content of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of the students stated that they had a basic, “clean” account to which their parents had access but also had secret accounts.
One mother, who had accidentally gained access to the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter, encountered a teenager who urged others to “against him”.
A study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two social profiles, half of which admitted that one of them was usually secret.
Head of HMC Mike Buchanan says: “Many adolescents are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is a disturbing fact.”
Alied Doyle will become the “voice of athletes” of Scottish light athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Alied Doyle was elected to the Scottish Light Athletics Board as an observer member of the Director ' s Board.
Doyle is the most titled Scotland athletic athlete, and President Ian Beatty argues that this is an excellent opportunity for sports managers to take advantage of the extensive international experience of an athlete in the past decade.
“Alide enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and the world ' s easyatletic community, and we are confident that its participation will be of great benefit to a light athletics in Scotland,” states Bitty.
Doyle says: “I'm trying to be the voice of athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and promote sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 m at Atlanta Games in 1996, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and is now working as a row commentator on BBC, after a stroke has lost the ability to walk.
He writes in his Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I've lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I was going to get better, and if I did, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I was completely cured, I learned to walk again, and I’m doing a skillful exercise today!
Thank you so much for your support!”
The Milk Soup Advertising, in which mothers were compared to cows, shared the views of Internet users
The milk-sucking company has raised disputes on the Internet, publishing an advertisement in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to dominant cows.
By producing the market, “the world’s first chestless milk cake, which can be carried on the breasts,” Elvie has published an advertising music video showing the freedom that the new milkboat provides to feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a full hay of cows under a music track saying, "Yes, I feed my own milk, but you will not see my tail" and, "If you didn't notice it, it's my breast."
Then the choir said, "We follow, we follow, we feed our babies with breast milk, we follow, we follow."
This advertisement that was published on the Facebook page has raised disputes on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video has received a mixed reaction from the audience, many saying it sheds light on the breast industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must be pregnant and born to produce milk, except for their children to be taken away within a few days of birth,” writes one user.
Elvie Molocotoss (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk sucks for mothers who leave their children?"
Another user adds: “The Recklama departed from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song was “very beautiful. ”
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed a baby, I'd certainly buy one.
The breast feeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a little crazy, but it's kind of feeling like that.
A brilliant product," wrote one user.
And another comment: “Great advertising for mothers who feed their breasts (often they do it directly in their jobs or in the toilet) and who, indeed, feel a little "cows."
This advertisement is not to praise or chastise our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with these invisible milk suckers hidden under the busthalters.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
In fact, Elvie's milkboats are totally unreasonable, have no wires or pipes, are freely placed in the busthalter for feeding, and are unrecognized by allowing women to move, hold children, and even walk outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, an early child development partner and an expert in Mama, commented: “Molocots Elvie is such a revolutionary product that he deserves a bold and provocative advertising.
Having parallels between women and subsidized cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding and all its problems, showing in a jolly and cheerful way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk cockroache gives.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk cocktails get in the newslines.
During the London week, the mother of two children appeared at the designer's chimney of Martha Yakubowski, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children moved unhinderedly to a tent camp at the border with Texas
The number of children detained by migrants has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly crossings of the border has remained relatively constant, partly because the rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump Administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to endanger their stay in the country by taking the child under the supervision of them.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a high-ranking Immigration and Customs Officer, witnessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been requesting to be sponsored by the remaining minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees were not previously tried.
“Around 80 per cent of the persons who are either sponsors or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
We therefore continue to prosecute these persons,” said Albens.
According to the shelter workers, in an effort to expedite the formation of children, the officials introduced new rules that required some of them to be brought before a court within a month of detention, not 60 days later.
In order to state their legal status to the immigration judge, many are present on video, not personally.
Those who are considered not entitled to assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and information in recent months, the longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are increasing in larger institutions, such as Tornilo, where the signs that a child is having difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that by transporting children to tent camps, not giving them time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, this may exacerbate the trauma that many of them already struggle with.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Mualem, also called on Syrian refugees to return home without seeing the war in the country for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the foreign forces had been on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of counter-terrorism, and “to be considered accordingly”.
“They must leave immediately and without conditions,” he said to the gatherings.
Mualem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been expelled from their homes, “the war against terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Asad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 military personnel in the war-affected country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been created for their return and accused “some Western countries” of “disseminating irrational insurance”, which had led refugees to remain outside the country.
“We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They politicize what must be a purely humanitarian issue”.
The United States and the European Union caution that Syria will not be assisted in rebuilding until a political agreement on the cessation of war is reached between Asad and the opposition.
The UN Diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major ambit of the Idlib rebels provided an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian Turkish Agreement prevented the extensive attack by the Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had “further deadlines” and hoped that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants associated with the Al-Qaida front of Nusra, who would be “destructed”.
UN Messenger Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee will be convened in the near future, comprising representatives of the Government and the opposition to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mualem presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in that committee, stating that the work of the commission should be limited to “constitutional review” and cautioned against interference.
Why the Trump will win the second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if the impistence and scandal are not prematurely completed by his presidency, which is probably the hope of many liberal audiences.
And that will no doubt be “the most dramatic legacy of the Presidentship in all history!”
At present, there is no indication of the fatigue of the audience.
Since 2014, the ratings of the Prime Times have increased more than twice as much — to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times as much as 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primm audiences, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded cable ratings by collecting 3.5 million spectators at evenings during the show of major news.
“It is a fire to which people are drawn because it is beyond our comprehension,” says Neil Bar, director of the ABC “Designed Survivor”, about a member of the Cabinet of Ministers who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed by an attack.
Nell Skowell, a long-standing comic book writer and author, “Only funny: a few unpleasant truths about entering the Hollywood boy club,” offers another theory.
She recalls one day she was on a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
'Why?' she asked.
He said, "Yeah, because he's funny!"
There is something valuable in all of this chaos that is fun.
Of course, as opposed to all other content broadcast on television, Washington's video lines can determine the future on the Roe v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
The exception is a luxury that only the most privileged audiences can afford.
Yet, when you've been watching for six hours in a row, the expert group discusses the use of Bob Woodwood's "deep background" for its book "Strah," or the Pol Manafort jacket of $15,000 from the skin of the ostrich (spoiled with pride," says Washington Post), or the sharp description of Stormi Daniels, say so, Mr. Tramp's anatomy is already beyond the normal awareness.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same eyes, for instance.
“It is his work to make us feel that the realistic show is that it feeds you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, Executive Director Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Pahwn Stars, on the changing actorial composition of the Tramp show and the daily turns of the story (draca with N.F.L., the praise of Kim Chen Yin).
You can't afford to miss any episode, or you're hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleis this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the northern coast of Kauai, the sun lighted, but he hid inside his house and looked MSNBC while writing CNN.
He could not escape the screen, at least not when he showed how Brett Kavano appeared before the Legal Committee of the Senate and decided the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy show, people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of western civilization,' says Mr. Flace.
“Then I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Autsaider money is poured into the worst intermediate elections leading the White House
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania receives cash flows thanks to the change in districts in Congress, in which two officials participate in the race for the same place.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed so long ago, supports a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lamb, who took place in another district in extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, the Republican of Kit Rotfus, who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly intersected with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January had ruled that the old areas had been in violation of the Constitution as a result of election.
The racing in the new 17th district led to a hot debate on the financing of campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lamba became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small difference in the special elections widely observed in March at Congress in Pennsylvania County 18.
This place has been occupied by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for China's support, but then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had caused a negative reaction to Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump met warmly with President Hanama Juan Carlos Varela, who was also in Panama until the Tempa management team was evicted.
Representatives of the State Department decided to withdraw American leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “the recent decisions on the non-recognition of Taiwan”, stated at the beginning of this month, the Spokesperson of the Department of Hezer Naurt.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received some $140 million from the United States in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and targeted visas restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
In the background of the regular holding of internal meetings, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, followed by a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration in the United States.
However, by mid-September, high-level representatives of the Administration had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to proceed, and had actually discontinued the consideration of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled to take place in mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens to indicate that the Administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three American diplomatic representatives safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without taking any new stringent messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm that an outside analyst that is similar to that of the administration, but also speaks on anonymity.
Learn History
The next step may be to report to the Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible impediment to Mr. Tramp to justice, which is now very significant evidence in public reports.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly inquiring into the facts that the Trimpa campaign with Russia and its attacks during the last elections.
If Congress replaces the master, Mr. Trump will face the responsibility of that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to the voters, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there are many “ifles”; I do not want to say that the fall of Mr. Tramp is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to coup and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened if the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak forces in Munich.
However, we did not do so and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
The course of history is taking place at such points, and the unconditional march of democracy hastens or delays.
The Americans are experiencing some of these critical moments now.
What shall we do if Mr. Trump dismissed Deputy Attorney-General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Muller's destiny?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the President ' s activities and reasoned on his inappropriateness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times data were not correct.
“How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavano is not complete or true, or if it is still upheld by a Supreme Judge in spite of credible accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in the medium term for the Congress, which will hold Mr. Tramp accountable?
If we do not go through these trials well, this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we can walk them decently thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewish who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime, whose officials once occupied an embassy house, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she spent me burning Saturday candles on a table with a swastic symbol.

Graham Dorrans of Greengers is optimistic in front of a clash with the Vienna Rapid soccer club.
Reingers accept the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Austrians, after the impressive nothing in Spain over Viljarreal at the beginning of this month, will enable them to take strong positions in the Group of the League of Europe.
The trauma of the knee hindered the semi-defensor, Gram Dorrance, to speak for the first time in the season, with an account of 2:2 against Viljarreal, but he believes that the Reingers can use the result as a temple to achieve great results.
"It was a good moment for us, because William's is a good team," said a 31-year-old soccerist.
“We went into the game, believing we could get something, and left with nothing.
Perhaps we could eventually cope, but in general, no one was likely a just result.
They probably played the first time, and our success was at a second time, where we proved ourselves better.
This Thursday will be another big European night.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a complicated game, because they've shown a good outcome in their last game, but given the support of the hospitals, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive outcome.
The past year has definitely been a heavy year, given all my trauma and replacements in the club itself, but now there's a good factor in this place.
The composition is beautifully vaulted, and the kids are really enjoying it; training has been done in the Worm.
I hope that we will be able to move forward, leave behind the past season and succeed.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of their pension accumulations
Although the interviewers had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the national study said that they had discussed the value of long-term care with their spouses.
However, only 10 per cent said that they spoke to their children on the subject.
“People want to be cared for by a family member but do not try to discuss the subject with them,” says Holly Sneider, Vice President of Nation in general on life insurance.
That's what we should start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for something that they may have to care for if you do not express your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your consultant and your family, where and how you will receive medical assistance, as this choice may be an important factor in spending.
Consult with your financial consultant: it will help you to develop a payment plan for these costs.
Your choice of funding for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care policy or a mixed monetary insurance policy that will help cover these costs or insure yourself by means of your own property, provided that you have money.
Order your legal instruments: free yourself from legal battalions.
Provide medical trust and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your health care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
It is also recommended that consideration be given to the possibility of financial trust.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are incapable of doing so.

Earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed by a major earthquake and the tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and are expected to increase the number of deaths.
As a result of the disengagement of communications, rescuers are unable to obtain any information from Dongal, a region north of Palu, near the 7.5-point earthquake episcent.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu as a result of the disaster.
Here are some of the key facts about Palu and Dongal on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, at the end of the narrow coal on the western coast of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (dated for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and the tsunami took place.
Dongala is a district extending 300 kilometres [180 km] of the coastline north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
The district, administrative area less than the province, was 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, in particular the Dongal coastal region.
Nickel production is also important for the provincial economy, but largely concentrated in Morala, the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years the tsunami has been devastated several times in Palu and Dongal.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of Dongal homes.
Tsunami also occurred in the western part of Dongal in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcanic volcanic ring and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The heavy earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunami, which struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake by force 6.8 perished south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, calling the tsunami on the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: The earthquake of the magnetud 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.

Sarah Paylin's older son was arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trak Paylin, the son of the former governor of Alaska and the vice-candidate of President Sarah Paylin, was arrested on charges of the attack.
The 29-year-old Paylin of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, intruding into the situation of domestic violence, and for resistance to arrest, according to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska Police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in the Mat-Su Detention Unit and will be released under a bail of $500.
He appeared before the court on the Sabbath, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “single innocence”.
Pailina is threatened by three small crimes of Class A, which means that he may be deprived of liberty for up to one year and fined by $250,000.
He is also charged with a crime of Class B punishable by imprisonment of up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
It was not the first time that criminal charges were brought against Pelin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, counterfeiting of domestic violence and possession of weapons of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her on the face.
Sarah Paylin was criticized by veterans in 2016, after explaining her son's misconduct to the post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake caused a tsunami of 7.5 points and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central Sulawesi, which is north-east of the capital of Indonesia of Jakarta.
The social networks have videotapes of an accident.
Hundreds of people were on a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the shore.
The Federal Procurator's Office wishes to impose a rare death sentence on the suspect in New York.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York seeks the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist in New York, which killed eight people, a rare penalty for a federal crime that has not been applied in the State since 1953.
In October, Saipov, for 30 years, allegedly took the home Depot truck to attack a bicycle road on the West Said highway in Lower Manhattan, whiping pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight persons and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the intention to achieve the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York.
According to a judicial document, the two charges may result in the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out Saipov ' s conviction with 22 counts of charges, which included eight murder charges for the purpose of a reception normally used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “preciously planned and deliberate”, Saip carried it out, as described, in “abusive, cruel and criminal manner”.
“Sipullo Habibullahevich Saipov suffered injuries, damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laura Dekadta, Darren Draq, Ariael Erliya, Ernana Ferruki, Ernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnukco”, as stated in the notification of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have elapsed since the prosecutor in the Southern New York district demanded the death penalty for the criminal offence.
In September 2009, the accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last death penalty in the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 against Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed for conspiracy in favour of the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi were executed using an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov ' s judicial documents, the Uzbek citizen showed that there was no repentance after the attack he had committed.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he had done so.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired to see the IGIL video on the phone to commit the attack.
He also asked the IGIL flag to be hanged in his hospital room, and the police reported.
He denies his guilt for all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders speaking on Saipov's side, said that they were “probably disappointed” by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the death penalty, not life imprisonment without release, will only exacerbate the pain of those events for all participants,” said Patton.
Saipov ' s protection had previously applied to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tori said that NUJEL FARAJ should not be responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest at the Tori Nigel Faraz conference, he vowed to “mobilize the people's army”.
The former Ukip leader said that the “Nakal” Europeanskeptics should be “sense” for the politicians, since a member of the Parliament of Teresa May suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bown, a conservative party member at Birmingham, said that Britain would already be “out” if Mr. Faraz was Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Ms. May in trying to reconcile her deep-separated ranks is compounded by the fact that members of the Tori party opposed the withdrawal of the EU join in a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The Prime Minister is striving to maintain his compromise plan, which was expressed in Chekers in the midst of the attacks by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The allies insist that she continue to try to enter into a deal with Brussels, despite negative reactions, and thus make Euroskeptics and lieborists choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bown said at the meeting Leave Means Leave, in Solikhalle, that he wants to play Chekers.
He suggested that Mr. Faraja be leveled and held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been responsible, we would have gone out, ” he said.
The representative of Wellingboro added: “I will continue to advocate Brexit, but we need to play Chekers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their views and wanted to remain completely inconsistent with the reality”.
Brexit party fan Andrea Jenkins was also at the meeting, and he commented to the journalists: “I say, Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
“Checkers are unplugged among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, and he is also unplugged among the members of our party and our activists, who are in fact rioting the streets and first of all choosing us.
"Please put Chekers back and begin to listen to what you are told."
In her sharp appeal to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers remain in their work if they remain faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraz said that if policies were to make a decision taken at the 2016 referendum, they must be forced to “hear the filament”.
“This is now a question of confidence between us, human beings, and our political class,” he says.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say to them, "We will not let it go."
Turning to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit’s betrayal, to be fiery.
“We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has won us in Brexit, and we will not be reassured until we become independent, independent and proud United Kingdom”.
In the meantime, Brexit’s opponents went through a demonstration on Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists wobbled the Tori v Brexit posters on these weekends.
At the opening of the conference, Lord Adonis, member of the Leiborist Party, criticized conservatives because of security problems in the mobile annex of their party.
“And these people claim that they can set up the IT systems and technology of Canada plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's one complete farce.
Brexit does not exist in principle," he claims.
Warren plans to “examine thoroughly” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
Member of the U.S. Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would be “a careful study of the possibilities of balloting in the Presidents”.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat on Saturday told her about her future at the West Massachusetts meeting.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trampa, is being held in November to re-election against a member of the Republican Party, Jeff Dil, who was co-chair of the Trimpa campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
They're talking about her chances of taking up Trampa's post in 2020.
On Saturday in Holioka, she had held a regular meeting with the voters; since Trump assumed office, it had already been her 36th meeting with the voters in the format of the Rutuchi meeting.
One participant asked her if she planned to stand for the presidency.
Warren replied that the time had come for the women to go to Washington to reconstruct our broken government, and that would require a woman upstairs.
As a result of the assassination of Sims (incarnated), the LSU player was arrested
The Baton Rouge police, Luiziana, announced on Saturday that the suspect of the murder (fighting) of a basketballist LSU Wade Sims on Friday had been arrested.
At 11 a.m. in English, at the press conference, the Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Daton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the Police Department published a video of shooting to help identify the person who was able to be filmed on the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot at the Southern University Campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims has received a firearm in the head, which has resulted in his death,” said on Saturday journalists, Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed that he was involved in the incident, had weapons with him and shot at Wade Syms.
When Simpson was arrested, he did not resist and was detained at the East Baton Rouge District Police Department.
The young man grew 1 m 82 cm in Bathon Rouge, played 32 start-up games in the last season and gained an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 picks for the game.
Grand Privy of Russia: Lewis Hemilton approaches to the title of the world champion after command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fetel
Since Valterie Bottas had been qualified on Saturday by scourging Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes command tactics would play a major role in the race.
From the Poul-Possionn Bottas had a good start and was almost hanging on Hamilton when he defended his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel was the first to go to the pie-step, leaving Hamilton to splash in the tail of the whole group -- the choice that had become decisive.
Mercedes left one circle afterwards and left behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some struggle with the wheel wheel, flew forward, leading the driver to reluctantly leave the inner space free, risking being trapped after a dual movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstaphen started from the back of the grid and was in the seventh place by the end of the first circle.
He then led most of the race by holding his tyres in order to finish quickly, putting Kimi Rakeconen in the fourth place.
As a result, he left on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace of the remaining eight circles, as Rykconen took the fourth place.
The day was difficult, because Valtery had done fantastic work for the weekends and had shown a real grace by sharing it with me.
The team made such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in the reserve," said Hamilton.
Traditional Sign Language
President Donald Trémp criticized Senator Daenne Finstein at a meeting with the voters on Saturday for her allegation that she did not promulgate a letter from Christina Blace Ford, accusing Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the position of supreme judge, in sexual harassment.
Speaking at the meeting in Western Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, saying that the Senate had shown that the participants were “foul, disgusting and lying people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what has taken place in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, is anger, anger, disgustingness and falsehood,” he said.
"You see all these leaks, and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dyanne Fainstein, did you get the information?
Remember her answer... did you get the document information?
Oh, no.
I didn't.
Okay, stop.
We didn't screw up, he added with the senator's intonation.
In July, Finstein received a letter detailing the charges made by Ford v. Kavano, and in early September it was illegally promulgated, but Fainstein denied that the leakage occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s claims, but I did not confuse her information,” declared Fainstein to the Committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this information in secret, and I did as she asked."
However, the manner in which she denied the charges of leakage seems to be displeased with the President, who commented on it during the Saturday meeting: “This is what I will tell you: the body’s language has made her awesome.
Maybe she wasn't, but the tongue of the body was the worst I've ever seen.
While continuing to protect his candidate for the position of Supreme Judge, whose three women were accused of sexual harassment, the President suggested that democrats used these charges for their own purposes.
“They definitely try to restore power in all available ways.
We see the filth, the disgusting, the indifference, the insults they're going to hurt, through whom they should pass over, in order to gain power and control,” quotes Mediaite Presidential words.
British Elite Hokken League: Dandi Stars 5-3 Belpast Jayants
Patrick Duaier killed two naked for Jayants in a game against Dandy
In the Elite Hokque Liga, Dandy Stars was paid for the Friday defeat against Belfast Jayants, winning the answer match on Saturday with 5-3 in favour of Dandi.
Jayants received an early two-headed advantage as a result of Patrick Dueyer's and Francis Bowiler's strikes.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the level of the home team before Duyer led the Giants to lead.
François Buchar compared the Dandi account before two naked Lucas Lundwald Nilsen stabilized their victory.
For the people of Adam Kifa, who had won Dandy at 2:1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was a third defeat in the Elite League season.
This was the fourth meeting between the parties during the season when Jiantes won three previous matches.
The first naked of Duayer was at 3:35 p.m. after Kendall McFall's bare paste, with David Rutherford's support, and Bowiler doubled four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward assisted Coney in equipping the account at 15:16.
Duyer ascertained that Jayants had intercepted the initiative on the first break when he killed the second head in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts were regrouped, and Buchar again equiped the account by slapping his head at 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran joined together to help Nilsen to give Dandy the first opportunity to gain leadership at the end of the second period, after which he, together with his team, secured the victory by holding the rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
Jayants, who have now lost four of the last five matches, is being sent to Milton Cains for the next match to be held on Friday.
Aviadistr died in order for hundreds of people on board to escape the earthquake
The Indonesian air detector was killed after he deliberately went to death to make the aircraft with hundreds of passengers able to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of the severe earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday, the tsunami.
Strong underground pushs continue to destroy the area, and many residents in the city of Palu are under the siege of buildings.
Although his colleagues were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the terrifying high of Mutiara Sís Al-Jufri airport, Palu town.
He stayed in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft, which was then on a landing lane, was able to fly safely.
Then, when he felt that the tower was falling off, he jumped from it.
Later, he died in a hospital.
The Indonesian Air Navigation representative Johannes Siraite stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to get him to a large hospital in another town.
Regrettably, the manager died before the helicopter got to Palo.
“We are very sorry for this loss, ” he added.
However, the authorities fear that the number of deaths resulting from the earthquake may reach thousands, since, according to disaster management agencies, access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is likely to increase, as a large number of people are still under debris, and many have never been able to get out of there, ” said the representative of the Sutopo Puruvo Nugroho.
The waves that reached 6 meters [6 m] were devastated by the city of Palu, where the mass burial of the dead would pass on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Cousuma, a 35 - year - old mother, tells Sky News: “Specific aid brings the victims every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
The mini-markets are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, relates to CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross hastens to help survivors, but we do not know that they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken a rather serious scale, but it can be much worse.”
President Joco Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the armed forces of the country, in particular, saying: “I request you all to work day and night to carry out all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?”
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini reports that one person disappeared after the plane crashed in the lagoon
Avia company, which was flying an accident in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person was missing, while it was previously said that all 47 passengers and the crew had safely left the drowned aircraft.
Air Niugini states that, as of Saturday, it has no information about one male passenger.
Avia company stated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and the police to try to find that person.
The aircraft was unable to respond immediately to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his or her age or nationality.
Local sailors helped to save other passengers and a plane team after he fell on the water, trying to land at the Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven persons had been taken to the hospital.
Avia also reported that on Saturday, six passengers were hospitalized and all were in stable condition.
The causes of aerial accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy claim that the aircraft landed in a lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses argue that the plane was unable to land on the airstrip.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane got too low on the airstrip.
“And that's very good, ” Janes adds.
Janes told him that he and other passengers were able to get to an accidental exit on a drowned plane because the level of water was on the belt.
He also told me that the stewardesss were panicking and shouting on board, and that he had received a light head injury.
The U.S. Navy reports that seafarers repairing the jar nearby also helped to save by using an onerous boat on which they transported people to the shore before the aircraft was loaded about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
The Flight Safety Network shows that 111 people have been killed in air accidents in the past two decades, but none of these accidents have been associated with Air Niugini.
Analyst on intelligence has been able to prove the burning of a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution instituted a case against the man accused of burning the residents of the Mississippi in 2014.
A United States Department of Justice analyst Paul Roolett gave a long-term testimony as an expert witness in the area of intelligence analysis.
He told the departmental members how he used mobile phone records to compile a general picture of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old Jesse Chambers victim the night she died.
Roolett reported that he had received data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to this data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that night, contrary to his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his mobile phone was close to Chambers; when this was found, the police interrogated Saintford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Saintford whether Tellis was right, claiming that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it was a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before she died.
However, according to telephone records, they were only called for one week.
Roolett also showed that some time after the death of Chambers Tellis had removed her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," says Hail.
The defence should begin to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is an conscious hip hop?
Trio hippers are going to fight negative attitudes towards this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group of Bristol asserts that Hip Hop has changed, leaving the original political and social problems.
The panellists want to return to their roots and make the “conscious” hip hop popular again.
Artisans such as The Fugees and the Common have recently witnessed a renaissance in Britain thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York Nanny brought to court a family couple because of racist texts
The New York Nanny brought to court a family couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a report from a woman complaining that the nanny had been “one more black”, which the woman had wrongly sent to her nanny instead of her husband.
The spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that a claim has been filed with the “heal of extortion”.
Lensi Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern that the new nurse offered by the Child Care Service, Gisel Maurice, was black when she came to her family for her first working day in 2016.
“NONEEEAY, THAT IS NOT THAT, THAT IS ONE NORMA, ” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flexsman in her husband’s text.
However, instead of sending a text to her husband, she twice mistakenly sent him to Ms. Maurice.
Aware of her deficiency, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, stating in the service that a nanny who was afro-American had done a bad job, and that they were expecting a Philippine rather than an African American, reports New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now submits to the court for a family couple and demands compensation for the dismissal of $350 per day in six months, under the original oral arrangements, which, however, were not established by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she said on Friday, adding, “And I know it's discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the charge of racism, and claim that the dismissal of Maurice could be considered a reasonable step, since, if offended, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her in a report what she really didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, post.
"But would you trust your children to someone you were rude with, even if you were grieved, who didn't want it?
Would you trust your newborn child?
Come on!'
Plasco said that his wife had born a child only two months ago and had been in a “very difficult situation”.
"And are you ready to pursue the man in this situation?
It's not very nice of you," he added, a banker specializing in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already rendered its sentence in social networks, indicting a couple of inadmissible behaviour and logic problems.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the course with the bear speaking, said the new letter
Bonda’s daughter, Karen Janquel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publishing, said about the letter: “It’s hard to put herself in the place of the first reader before it was published.
It's very funny to know that Paddington has a huge success.”
She also said that her father, before he had decided to write a child book on the bear, had worked as a BBC operator and would have given up on the optimism of the publication, and had added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of his books had been “happy and bitter” since the author had not been published last year.
With regard to the Paddington bear itself, she refers to him as “a very important member of our family” and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually became known.
“He was a quiet and modest man, ” says his daughter.
“Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had succeeded; he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think that's how he felt about the success of Paddington.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he has always given due attention to the bear itself.”
I was forced to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After landing the plane, her daughter was taken to the hospital of Nizza Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors futilely tried to save her life.
“We called and said everything was really bad that something went wrong, ” says Mrs. Ednan Laperuza.
“But he called again and said she would die in the next two minutes, and we must say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Mother, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medicines that doctors gave her, causing her heart to work, gradually ceased to operate while leaving her body.
She died before she was expected.
I was supposed to just sit down and wait, knowing that everything's coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, yell, or cry, because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself firmly in my hands.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan Laperuza, sad about the loss of her daughter, took a plane along with other passengers, humiliating with the enormous loss she had just experienced.
“No one around me knew what had happened, ” she says.
“ My head shook, I kept crying.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this pervasive feeling of compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support so much.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who survived the loss of loved ones prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are trying to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are putting postcards on the Walsh bridge with comforting words and telephone numbers for which people can seek support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 years old when he was depressed, and when he was 18, he killed himself.
“ I don’t want other parents to experience the same thing as I do every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, says that her son was a great cook and had a fucking charming smile.
“All loved his smile.
Everybody said that when he smiled, the room seemed to be lighting."
However, before he died, he left his job because he was experiencing a truly terrifying time.”
That happened in 2014, and Tyler, who killed him, found his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I'm still afraid that it's a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis invented these cards, “that people might know that there is someone to whom you can turn and tell everything, even if that's your friend.
You can't sit and keep quiet, you need to talk to people."
Mrs. Humphriz, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who had lived with him for 15 years, who was not soon after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed, upset or something in that kind," she says.
“A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
It was especially bad for him at Christmas. He did not even look at the children when they opened their gifts."
She says his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must pass through it, this event shocked our family.
It ripped it apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Bretta Cavano's future hangs on the hair: the FBI is starting to investigate.
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for, an investigation limited by time and volume, we could bring at least a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee was “striking” against a growing chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to carry out an investigation?
Time is the reason for their hesitation.
The intermediate elections will be held only five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as expected, all will be bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to obtain the person they want and to elect him as the supreme judge of the country.
George W. Bush calls the senators, lobbying the support of Mr. Kavano, who has since worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife, Ashley, who was then personal secretary, Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI publishes its report?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 democrats, will be voted.
To date, it is not clear whether Mr. Kavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the position of the Chief Justice.
The number of North Korean winners decreased with Kim
Since Kim Chen Yen came to power seven years ago, the North Korean leapers to South Korea have been reduced, stated the South Korean legislator.
Pack Bohn Seug, referring to data from the Ministry of the South, stated that, compared with the 2,706 flights recorded in 2011, the figure last year had decreased to 1127 cases.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates imposed by smugglers who were exporting people, had been key factors.
The Pyongyangs do not comment publicly.
South Korea ' s citizenship is ultimately proposed for the vast majority of North Korean winners.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most people run through China with the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a secure demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China regarded the winners as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often subjected them to forced repatriation.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still in war, have improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, two leaders met in Pyongyang to resume the deadlock of nuclear disarmament negotiations.
This took place after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Yun in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on the disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yun Ho, accused the United States of their sanctions to impede progress in this regard.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not be able to start disarmament unilaterally,” said Mr. Ri in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavano “external” and asserts that he is not worthy of work before the Supreme Court of Justice.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelosi named Bretta Kavano, a candidate for the position of the Supreme Judge, “exterritical”, and said that he was unpleasant because of his temperament to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can't help but think that if a woman had ever allowed herself to behave like that, she would have been immediately called a “expression,” says Pelosi about her reaction to the testimony of the Cavano Legal Committee of the Senate on Thursday.
Cavano emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's charges of sexual harassment that were allegedly committed when both were still teenagers.
Cavano spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even shouting and choking about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the Committee ' s democrats, calling the accusations against him “a grotesque and well-planned murder of an existing person” organized by liberala, arguing that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kavano had merely confirmed that it was not possible to serve in the Supreme Court because it was biased against democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his claims, as well as with the way he attacks on the Clintons and Democrats,” she says.
The peloss were resented when she was asked whether she would try to hold Kavano accountable if his fault was confirmed and if the democrats received the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I will say that if he doesn’t speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, it is not only for the Supreme Court but also for the court at which he is present,” said Pelosi.
Cavano is currently a judge of the D.C District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, she was concerned about possible decisions by Kavano with regard to the Law on Accessible Medical Services or “Rou v. Wade”, since it was considered a conservative justice representative.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavano had come to the attention of the party as to whether it would repeal some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“It is not the time to let the hysterical and biased man go to the office of supreme judge, and to cry out, ‘How wonderful!’ ” says Pelosi.
And women have to own it.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of anger; it cannot pass through it without tears.
“ When we get angry, we cry, ” said Ms. Steinem 45 later.
“I don't think it's so unusual as you think?”
She went on to say, "The woman who worked at the managerial office helped me very much, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that she used to explain to her interviewer, "You might think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really angry."
And then she just kept talking.
I was impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed to come out of anger in part because they are misleading.
One of my most painful memories about the first job in the office where men dominated: one day I wept from rage, but I was caught by an elderly woman who was a ruthless manager who I was always afraid of, and I got out on the staircase.
"Never let them see you crying," she said to me.
They do not know that you are weeping for evil.
They think you are upset, and they rejoice in the thought that they have finally proved you.’
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman from the Colorado Democrats, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential elections.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught on a slight intrigue and left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to stop her from being presidential.
“This decision was not well thought out, ” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates were already involved in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case "Belgage and seven Dwarves".
The campaign was nearing its end, it was very lagging behind the collection of funds, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, offered her only 250.
“I am for them, the valued goods, or what? ” she wondered.
When she delivered a speech declaring that she would not conduct a formal campaign, she was so enthusiastic — thankful to the people who supported her, disappointed by the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to the voters, as well as anger due to gender discrimination, that she suffocated.
“You would have thought I had a nervous breakdown, ” recalls Ms. Schroeder about the way the press reacted to it.
"We could think of Kleenex as my corporate sponsor.
I still thought what would they write on my monument?
"She's been crying for no end"?
How trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first Gulfs of Trade War between the United States and China have been deaf, and although the battle is far from completion, the division between countries can benefit Beijing in the long term.
Donald Trump, President of the United States, made the first warning early this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The largest escalation took place this week, when new tariffs affected goods worth $200 billion (150 billion) by actually taxing half of all United States goods from China.
Beijing had been counterfeit every time and had recently imposed taxes of $60 billion between five and 10 per cent for American goods.
China promised that the response to the United States would be equivalent every time, and the second largest economy of the world would not be likely to begin to experience at least the slightest difficulties soon.
Forcing Washington to retreat means abstaining from demands, but publicly abstaining from the United States would be too disgraceful to the President of China, Si Jingpin.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to correctly distribute its maps, the pressure of the United States trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“That is the fact that a short-term political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to economic conciliation in any of these countries, in fact, is much more dangerous than previously recognized by observers,” said Abigail Grayce, a researcher of the Analytical New American Security Centre (Center for New American Security), specializing in Asia.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of refugees
Syria affirms that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks assistance in the reconstruction of the country that has been devastated by the war of over seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al-Mualem, reported that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on the ground today has become more stable and secure because of the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live there in peace.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
A further six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country would not accept assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Consolidates the Reider Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Cup of Ryder, winning the U.S. team with a total of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National in the Paris suburbs, France.
The European Ryder Cup has been lost six consecutive times in Europe, and the European Ryder Cup has not won since 1993.
Europe returned the crown thanks to the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn, who had won the 14.5 points they needed to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Mikelson, who strenuously fought most of the tournament, took his first long-range blow in the water on the 16th berth of the par-3, withdrew his match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Golfist Molinari defeated in all his rounds by becoming the first four players who had ever walked 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated by a 5.4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbern Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dastin Johnson, has given up 2:1 to Jan Polter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Hispanic Serhio García, veteran of eight Raider Cups, was the winner of a tournament throughout Europe with 25.5 points for a career.
“ I don’t cry at all, but I can’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I've been able to help," says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's handing over the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram, who won a victory on Sunday over the American legend of Tiger Woods Golf, with an account of 2:1 in the solitary game.
“I feel incredibly proud of this victory — I grew up watching the Taiger Woods game, ” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now the record of his career is 13-21-3.
These figures are rather strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 principal titles, only to Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. assembly struggled all weekends, futilely trying to succeed, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the highest grade golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Fürik said after his team’s uncomfortable speech: “I am proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we were able to slightly crack Europe.
It didn't work.
We're taking off the hats to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played great.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee of the Ryder Cup, and we will move forward in success.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
We need to be able to lose.
We have lost."

The Red Tide is also observed in Pasco district.
The average concentration in and near Pinellas district was reported last week, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsboro, high concentrations in Manati and Sarasot districts and coastal zones, average concentrations in Charlotte district, high concentrations on the coast of the Li district, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier districts, there is still the likelihood of irritating breathing paths.
In northwestern Florida, no such probabilities were reported last week.
