Named number of new recruits ready to send to Donbas from Ukraine
The official representative of the People ' s Police of the Luhan People ' s Republic (LNR) said that, in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine would send at least 3,000 recruits to Donbass.

At the end of August 2018, the situation in Donbassa was exacerbated by the assassination of the head of the DNR, Alexander Zakarchenko.
The DNR authorities have described what has happened as a terrorist.

The head of the British MiDA compared the EU to the Soviet Union and prison
The British Foreign Minister, Jeremy Hunt, compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of captivating member countries of the community.
Such a statement was made by the diplomat at the assembly of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, opening on Sunday, 30 September.
According to Daily Mail, Hunt has thus commented on difficulties in the Brexit negotiating process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was established to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union prevented anyone from leaving it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from community to prison, the desire to leave it will not be reduced, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to flee," said the Minister.
He added that attempts to punish Britain for deciding to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, Prime Minister Tereza May stated that the Brexit talks were staggering.
So she commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.

In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London has left the community.

This is reported by CNBC News.

He is the head of the Space Corporation of SpaceX, the Neuralink Neurotechnology Company and the Telecars developer of Tesla, as well as the Paypal co-founder.
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission had previously filed with the Director General, Tesla Ilon Mask, because of his Twitter report on the possible ransom of the company.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy all stocks on a fixed price of $420.
The value of the share in $420 was allegedly “due to the significance of this number in the culture of marijuana”, reported earlier by the Bloomberg agency, with reference to the co-director of the Security Division of the Commission of Stephen Paykin.
At the same time, Ilon Mask later abandoned his plans to redeem shares.
Commenting on the US Securities and Exchange Commission against him, the businessman stated that the charges of fraud were unfounded and added that he was very disappointed and grieved by these claims.
"Honority is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not broken it in any way," said the businessman in an interview with CNBC.

Other plaintiffs also noted that Ilon Mask’s unwary remarks led to sharp fluctuations in the course.

However, if the Mask could not resolve his dispute with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it would be in danger of being suspended from management by the company and even by prison.
In particular, the former chairman of the Harvey Pitt Commission stated to the CNBC Telecommunication.

He said that now, when “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage”, the renaming of the church is like, in Fascist Germany, “the Jews to impose a yellow six-end star.”
"It means marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for that purpose that this bill has been created," said a representative of the RPC on the television station "Rossia 24".
Mitropolitan also stressed that the UPC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian church, because "the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country."

The outcome of our meeting with autoproducers should be in the foreseeable future as the creation of the Russian Formula 1, which has no similarities in the world, said Dmitry Kozak.
We have to simplify our autoproducers in this direction.
It was about plans until 2024, but I don't think it's possible in such a time frame.
I think the more real dates are over the next ten years."
From 2012 to 2014, the "Formul-1" was a Russian licensed team called Marusi.
According to the Vice-premier, there are already investors ready to invest in the establishment of a domestic team in the World Championship of Roads in Formula-1.
I know that there are road sport lovers in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are willing to invest, ready to invest in the establishment of a Russian team called Formula-1, he said.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team has also emerged because this infrastructure has emerged in Sochi.”

That's a good, positive outcome.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the use of the Sochi Autodrum infrastructure throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak hasn't gone around, and the main theme of the day for Russian autosort lovers is the return of Daniel Kwaat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season,
He is the one who gives great hope.
Next year, for the first time in history, the Formula 1 will be able to take part in two main Russian pilots.
Although the further destiny of Sergei Sirotkin in the Royal Race is still unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not yet impressive: he has taken 18th place in the qualifications of Gran Prézi.
Let's hope that next season of our main pilots will be more than this year, Dmitry Kozak said.

The White House master recalled that he had taken the problem of North Korea from the previous administration as a major challenge in foreign policy.
The Trump noted that Barak Obama's team had started relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even be called to the leadership of the country -- it was simply that it hadn't been taken off.
The United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes to the White House “pretty letters”, noted the Temp.
The trump admitted that, at the beginning of his work, Kim Jung Yin had also been aggressive to Kim, which was mutually reciprocal.
But now their relationships have changed so much that the leaders have “loved each other”.
At the same time, Trump asked him not to take his words literally and warned that the United States media interpreted them as incompetent.
The trump pointed out that Pyongyang had recently ceased nuclear and missile tests, as well as closed military operations.
These are the merits of his administration, the president of the United States is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flatly spoke of Kim Chen Yin from the UN Genasamble rostrum.

At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK would continue until the full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nizzoi called for the “mosk language of Ukrainian” to be removed.
The Ukrainian child writer and championer of Laris Nizza's mother tongue called for the removal of the Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language from Ukraine.
To do so, it offers Ukrainian product, "cultural wave, cultural pressure."
Nizza shared with the Ukrainian publication Ombudsperson with her considerations on “the desirability of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine”.
According to her, the relevant Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is even eating and continues to grow.
In time, Ukrainians are “healthy” from that “mosk language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighbouring Poland, she said that Russian speech had been widely used on television and radio before, but in public space there was virtually no sign of it.
In the opinion of Nizza, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of Russian is, in her view, only “the expansion of the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level”.
Previously, Nizza shared the experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-language regime” in a child camp in Carpatha, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court with a network of Watsons bookstore, one of which was associated with her in Russian.
When Nizza didn't reach her, she screwed up a girl's bastard.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians is called “lingual schizophrenia”, calling on Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing names.
Recently, Nizzai stated that the name “Russ” had been stolen by Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
Even the Ukrainian Security Service had not escaped the wrath writer: after hearing the conversations of the staff with each other in Russian, she acted a scandal and left by slamming the door.

Yes, Dr. and Physiotherapist Vladimir Anatoljević Gashnave led me to the game, for which they are grateful!
"What about the atmosphere on the team?"
"It's not a secret for anyone that's easier after winning and restoring, and the mood in the collective is good.
Now we have a white lane, though we had a black one at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice in the supporters."
"Did you miss the game during the time you didn't go out on the field?"
"There's a little bit of a freak out, because there's a really unpleasant situation.
But once again, thanks to the physiotherapist and the doctors who put it on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and we rejoiced in the hospitals.
And the rest of it is second-hand."

The Head of the Committee of the Council of the Federation for International Affairs, Constantine Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a successful session for Russia and does not preclude it from becoming a turning point in the perception of the RF as an integral participant in solving global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my view, is that the rhetoric, which we have almost used in recent years for Russia, has now been more deterred,” said the Senator in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that, in previous years, the RF sometimes “had been identified as one of the three major threats to humanity, and along with the Ebola fever, together with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any event, in a group of Western countries, which had expressed itself unanimously.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed that “the theme of Russia had almost been a negative key.”
“If I carefully analyse the statement made by the President of the United States, the President of France, the statement by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not exactly correct,” said the politician, noting that Russia “was no longer a wall for which the tennis balls are trained.”
The Head of the Savfed Committee of the Principality does not preclude that this reflects a trend that, in his view, “will allocate the current session [the United Nations GENA], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, two, three.”
“I do not preclude that the current session may in some way be turning,” said Kosachov, “there are many examples of how Russia's connections are able to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example, he cited situations in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“After this is unfortunately not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be demanded over time,” added the parliamentarian.
This relates to what he believes is that Russia's “appropriate, healthy perception is not just an inalienable participant in solving the global problems of modernity”.
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we're going somewhere where the movement will no longer move backwards, it's going to move forward," he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop”.
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, and I have been very pleased to see that if, in the case of a year or two or five years ago, the Russian vision of the world was largely uninterested, the situation is different,” said the Chairman of the Committee of Sovfed.
In his view, this was due to the fact that “in the so-called new liberal order, which equates with the West, there was no answer to questions about how to address world problems because of the apparent shortfall of ideas in global space, the deficit of ideas on how to deal with the problems of the Middle East, terrorism, nuclear non-proliferation issues, migration issues”.
“And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious,” said Kosachov's confidence, emphasizing that in that sense, “the present session is a successful Russian delegation for Russia”.

In Damascus, they declared their right to use military force in Idlib.
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province, Idlib will not have to use military force, stated by the Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Mualle.
He said that Syria had the right to do so.
The Minister added that Turkey had an opportunity to quickly address the issue of the withdrawal of militia from the Russian banned organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports “RIA Newsty”.
The MiDA Head also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the Territories east of Euphrates in the case of the Kurdish aspiration to separatism.
At the same time, Muallem believed that negotiations with the Kurdish forces of SDF had been good until the United States had stopped.
On 17 September, Putin and the President of Turkey, Rejep Erdogan, agreed to establish by 15 October a demilitarized zone along the line of armed opposition and Government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry led the Youth Team of Chelsea.
Previously, it was reported that a 37-year-old defender had negotiated the transition to Moscow Spartacus.
According to the RT, with a reference to Mirror, the former Captain of the assembly of England, John Terry, led the Youth Team of Chelsea.
According to the source, a well-known player who has long been a member of the London Club will lead a team at the age of 23.
It's noted that Terry's coach headquarters will replace Jody Morris, who went to Derby Kenty.
Remember, in September, Terry was close to the transition to Moscow Spartacus, but eventually abandoned that idea after talking to the family.
The first vice-speaker of the Supreme Council, Irina Herashenko, apologized to the convicted person in the RF for the “spienage” of Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for not being released from the shadows.
She referred to this in video coverage to a political prisoner written on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Suschenko FSB.
She said that there was an act under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, whose participants had announced a hungry protest for the release of the Kremlin prisoners.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including well-knowing people, starve to the support of Oleg Santova, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiation, no interview wherever the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, demanded pressure on the Kremlin, pressure on Putin with one requirement: release of Oleg, release of Roman, release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those who are illegally held in the occupied territories of Donbassa and Crima,” said Heraschenko.
She also expressed her confidence that the tests would ensnare every Ukrainian woman, making us “a bitterer, more tighter in the protection of the national interests of Ukraine, in the protection of every Ukrainian person, in the understanding of what good is and what evil is.”
Recall that correspondent in Ukrinform in France, Roman Suschenko, was detained by Russian forcesmen on 30 September 2016 at Moscow airport.
On 7 October, he was charged with spying at the Directorate General of Minoбороna Intelligence.
On 4 June 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Suschenko to 12 years of strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia found that verdict to be legal.
The Russian prisoners were satisfied with the last Ukrainian request prior to its initiation into a colony.
NASA reported approach to the Earth of asteroid of the size of Big Ben
NASA, the American Space Agency, reported that a large SP1 asteroid is approaching the Earth at 160 m long.
According to Daily Express, a space object may exceed the height of a famous Big Ben or a London observatory wheel.
At the same time, there is no accurate data on its size.
The speed at which SP1 is moving is about 60,000 km/h. The lowest distance between asteroid and Earth will be 3 October.
It will then fly past our planet at 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million km.
Asteroid was first noticed on 19 September.
NASA assigned it to near-earth objects.
Previously, on 27 September, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency published the first video in history from the Asteroid Rügu surface.
Two Japanese bikes (planetgoes) launched with the Hayabusa-2 probe were able to obtain unique personnel.

"Arena Rastov" is one of the 2018 world championship stadiums.
It held five tournament matches.

Wahtang Kikabize on Cancer Control
Many artists are now talking about how they managed to cope with cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, but the history of popular people about the victory over cancer gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wachtang Kikabize confessed that he was alive only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which was pronounced as a verdict.
"I'm as if I've been hit by a hammer down the skull.
I fell down.
Lost orientation.
They put it in the hospital.
I couldn't hold the spoon there, I couldn't stand, I падed all the time.
We started an analysis, it turns out a bad case, the artery doesn't skip blood.
They brought me to Moscow, and they told me that I had a big dung kitten in my head, and that I had an emergency operation.
And during the surgery, the doctors at the kitt saw the tumor," Kicabize said in the "Overythings" program.
The tumor has proved to be malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, Tbilisi even came to say good - bye to his house.
But the actor’s wife did not allow a living actor to be buried; she believed that she would be able to cope with the disease and that she would not leave the bed of a loved one for over a year.
If Irena weren't, I wouldn't have been alive now.
Always when I had critical situations, it was like a rock," confessed the actor.
The acter was able to cope with the disease, and now he's happily living in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, the rumours of his sickness, and the untimely end, which come into the Network.
The Mirotinator has been introduced to the section “Christilische” of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto.
“After Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity” was the cause.
In addition, the neighbouring head of the MID has been exposed to “direct threats to the invasion of Ukraine” and “supporting separatist attitudes in Ukraine”, as well as to “in organizing provocation aimed at massive violations by Ukrainian citizens of the law”.
Let's note that before Siyarto in the Chistilisch, the nobleman of the Kyivo-Pecer Lavra Paul and the prosecutor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Mosko patriarchs) Onofrius agreed.
Their opposition to receiving Tomos as a local church in Ukraine was a flood.
Previously, by commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in Zakarpatti, President Peter Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
The authorities called the amount of the golden parachute of the Crown Zambuber
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the Deputy Governor of the Voronez district of Yuri Agibolova was made under the Regional Law on Public Positions.
At the same time, the real amount of the “golden parachute” of a vrio official was several times less than the amount expressed in the media.
Such explanations were provided to the regional government press service.
According to the law, Agibalov ' s salary is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, in the press, the one-time payment was less the income tax of 223,892 roubles than the 1 million roubles of the media.
The governor has received an old-age insurance pension since July 2018.
His post is more than nine years old.
The appointment of this pension and a one-time payment shall be made immediately after the dismissal of the post, explaining to the RIA Newsty Agency in the Government.
At the same time, Agibolova ' s prepayment was suspended when it was appointed to a state of duty, and its salary did not change over the previous period.
The winner of the Governor's elections, the Governor of the region of Alexander Gusev, entered the office on 15 September.
Agibalov was released as a result of the expiration of the term of office of the head of the area.
Similarly, the credentials of other government officials in the region have been completed.
On 29 September, the Telegram Nonsigar had published documents that indicated that Abigalova, who had left the position of a vice governor, had paid a 23-salaries termination allowance, and two days afterwards had received a similar position without the primordial “trio”.
The Deputy of the Lord of Justice called for schoolchildren to be told about the damage to masturbation
They are the first Vice-Chairperson of the Education and Science Committee.
Based on his experience, he noted in an interview that young people in masturbation were provoking the harmful information they were finding on the Internet.
This is at the educational and family levels, and the deputy is added.
Hennadiy Zeschenko, deputy of the Lord of the RF (introducing Moscow):
In general sexual education, children need to do so because there is a risk of a child’s sexual health, both a boy and a girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the development of children is quite early, and there are still large scissors between their sexual abstinence and the possibility of formally entering inter-sexual contacts.
According to Yeschenko, solutions to the problem hindered “change”, the silence of “sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate child-rearing.
The doctor is confident that she is faced with many teenagers.
The deputy believes that lessons on the harm of masturbation are first and foremost found in hyperourbanized schools in the regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim Republic, we're not going to understand with you, in a mild way," said the professor.
Gennady Zeschchenko, a working academy RAMN, a member of the Presidency of RAMN, a doctor of medical science, a professor.
A well-deserved doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzsia, a member of the Bureau of the Russian Public Organization of the League of Nation.

As a result of the tragedy, several cars failed under the asphalt, two young people died on the ground from burns received.
AdG became the second popularity in Germany
The Antiimmigrant Alternate for Germany hits another record of popularity, and the Angels Mercel's ratings fall.
It appears that Germans have become seriously obscured by Immigration Policies by Angels Merkel, which has made the country a yearly target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is what we're most aware of in recent social surveys that the Anti-Immigrant Party Alternate for Germany is becoming increasingly popular and the position of the ruling Block of Mercel and Zeichopfera is weakening.
This week, AdH was hit by another record by climbing the second line in the popular sympathy rating.
Right conservators, with 17 percent of the popularity, were able to surround social democracies with about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be reduced to statistical errors, but the fact that a small group of Euro-Ceptic economists, created in 2013, has become a major political force.
Leadership in general is still holding the control unit of CMP/CCD, with about 30 per cent.
However, the tendency to lose points is seen here, since back in April, Angela Mercel’s support for the block was four percentage points above.
The German Chancellor, headed by the Government of Germany for the fourth consecutive term, also declines.
Today, 48 per cent of Germans are speaking in support of Angels, which is 7 per cent lower than last year.
Additionally, greens (15%), left (11%) and liberals (10%) were followed by social democracies.
Alternate evolution
The Alternate Party for Germany was established in September 2012 on the basis of the 2013 Alternate Choice Group, which included the members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group had initially become opposition to government courses, but at the first stage only dealt with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and EU interaction.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany ' s “supponement” of the weak economies of the EU, not excluding the possibility of returning to the German mark and complete exit of the country from the European Union.
In the face of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the AGG has expanded.
In 2013, the group was formed into a full-fledged party that took on a niche of Euroskeptics and began to severely criticize the Government for the failure of immigration policies.
At the recent parliamentary elections in 2017, AdG was able to fly for the first time in Bundestag, with 94 deputy chairs (of 709).
Two representatives of the Althernative for Germany received a seat in the European Parliament.
Video published with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens “nation of Bulgarians”
Leader of the political tok-how on Ukrainian TV, author of two books, Lesstep Drozdov in direct air, admitted that he regards his fellow citizens as a “Nation of Bolwans”.
They believe TV and don't read enough.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We haven't been teaching a culture of reading and practitioning from childhood," said the journalist.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drosdov, accusing him of lack of patrioticism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Television and Radio Committee of the Independent began to fight against literature, which contained the slightest hints of the criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of as many as 201 publications.
Manchester City played Brayton and went to the APL leaders.

Canadians set up a car in the case of apocalypse - driving magazine
Anyone who wishes can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions stated that it had already accepted applications for its new armoury.
Roshel Senator APC Bronevik Apocalypse
On the subject of the apocalypse, money is not just made by video players, movie studios, and book publishers.
Automobile companies are also learning a new niche now.
So Canada's Roshel Defence Solutions presented her apocalypse armor to the Senator APC.
At a time free of fantasies, engineers of this company create armoured vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers who, without special comfort but in full security, are placed in a wholesome bronecupule.
This bunker, and otherwise the design will not be called, since its armouring level is in line with B7, is installed on the ford Super Duty chassis of a powerful peak.
Its armoured days are also capable of protecting the capsule against undermining by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Roshel Senator APC
In order to prevent passengers from harming even an explosive wave from a shell crashing near a car, the car salon is equipped with special depreciating chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire-fighting system.
Roshel Senator APC car is equipped with a night vision camera system, as well as a firewalled tower on the roof.
There's no equipment in the car.

The chances of stuck completely at the apocalypse of Roshel Senator APC
To see the apocalypse armor of Roshel Senator APC will be available at a special exhibition in Washington, D.C., to be held in October.
Named the death of the universe
The universe is still alive for some 140 billion years, a decade higher than the age of an observed world of about 13.8 billion years.
A study of the international team of scientists is put into the library of electronic primens arXiv.org and is directed to publication in the Journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports Japan’s Asahi Shimbun.
Experts have come to this conclusion by observing the subaru telescope with the Hyper Suprime-Cam camera for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 per cent of the world's energy and masses, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ¶CDM (CERD) and the Cold Dark Matter, have evaluated the growth rate of the universe, which has been a little slower than previously considered.
The Subaru Press Release of the Observatory noted that the observation had provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, while the accounting of the European Space Telescope Planck had clarified the limitations imposed on the CDM parameters.
In July, scientists modelled the possible loss of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments to the effect that the world under review would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Disappearance.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to learn the opinion of the people about pension reform is delayed indefinitely
On Saturday in Moscow, there was a meeting of a general federation initiative group against the age of retirement.
Representatives of 13 sub-groups took part in a variety of language (five wording were registered by the whole Central Assembly).
They decided to apply to the CIC for registration of a single initiative group and to ask the Russians: “You do not increase the age of old-age pension established by the pension legislation as of 1 July 2018 after which Russian citizens are entitled to appointment?”
The wording was registered by a Voloyear subgroup whose representatives did not participate in the congregation but whose language was considered the most simple and legal receptacle.
Most of the members of the meeting were supporters of the member of the Justice Russia, Elijah Sviridov (six subgroups) and CRCF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups, from the Lower Novgorod, Voronesja and Orenburg, joined them.
Sviridov had previously said “Videos” that the invitations had been sent to all the initiators and that some 40 subgroups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semennova, head of the Voloyear subgroup (which was supported by another 15 subgroups), said, "Videos," that the invitations were not received and were not planned, "We didn't understand who a friend and who the enemy was."
Otis Rash died.

Admiral created us with great problems.
Zinethula Bilaletdinov: Admiral created us with great problems.
The Chief Principal Coach, Ak Barsa, Zinethula Bilaletdinov, summarised the match of the regular CCW championship v. Admiral (4:2).
"It was not a simple game, it was complicated.
The rival was worthy of war, causing us great problems.
I'm glad we've played well in the majority today.
I've already said that someday the naked will come, the main thing is that we work on it.
And that we win, too, is very important."
"Why did you decide to give Danis Zaripova a resting-time in this series?"
"We have our own program on which he works.
That's why it was the decision," quotes the Billetdin Press Service of the Club.
Ilon Mask will leave the head of the Tesla Directors Board
According to the agreement, Mr. Musk would have to leave the chairmanship of the Board of Directors of Tesla and pay a fine of $20 million.
At the same time, the businessman will retain the position of the Chief Executive Director of the company, reports the AFP with a reference to the regulator's data.
Tesla will also have to pay a fine of $20 million.
Previously, the regulator filed a suit against Ilon Masca, officials, believed that he had misleaded Tesla investors, since the businessman had accepted the purchase of all the high price shares of the company - $420 for paper.
In the Loko game, the "Ahmat" errors of Turbin darted like the horns of abundance.
The former judge of the All-Fellowship category, Vladimir Levitin, commented on the work of the arbitrator Evgeny Turbin at the 9th tour of the Russian Championship “Lokomotive”, “Ahmat”, and examined the controversial episodes of the game.
How do you judge Eugenia Turbin in the Lokomotiv-Achmat match?
- I believe that the arbitrator has confirmed his inappropriateness to the Russian Prime League magistrate.
I am surprised that in the meeting of the Spartacus fifth tour, Dinamo, neither the Turbin himself nor the JI leaders have made serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result has not slowed down in the ninth tour: the errors in his actions, and the private passes of gross admissions have slept like the horns of wealth.
For example, for the 50th minute, Eder's Railway is pulling his hands into his Achmata-Adolfo's fine.
It's eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't put the toolbars.
- How do you measure an episode involving Idova, who was 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball was in his hand?
- I think this was a deliberate game by the defender's hand in his punitive area.
Turbin was close to the moment, and he sees the episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This was to be seen by Reserve Judge Sergei Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three were asleep, and the toolbars were not assigned.
That's why the uterus account is distorted, and sports fairness has turned out to be disproportionate.
It was the same case when the judges had the concepts of extinguishing and burying the sports spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not decide to remove Oleg Ivanov's guest defender, who violated the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he gave him a demonstration.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I show you the second mustard?
- At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card didn't show up in the case.
The second one would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov told me after the match about double standards of justice, that some teams have been putting toolbars for violations such as in an episode with Idova and not in some way.
What do you appreciate as a football player?
- Seeing what to understand under double standards.
There was a toolbar.
He wasn't given.
So the arbitrator doesn't give the second panel to the opposite gate.
That's the principle that's being used.
And the second moment of double standards, the judge watches who plays.
Here's playing Lokmotive on Saturday, and Akhmata has serious claims for Turbin's work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the raped judge Kavano at the SNL startup.
American actor Matt Damon played a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretta Kavano, who was accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first edition of the new Saturday Night Live season on the NBC television.
During a small sketch, the actor played the Kavano at the hearings in the Senate on the charges of rape.
The candidate before the U.S. Supreme Court had previously drawn attention to his emotional and detailed experiences in a conversation with Senator Amy Clobushar.
Thus, Cavano repeatedly confessed his love for beer, but he said that he had never been drunk for nothing.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself on the charge of rape, Kavano claimed to have been a virgin in those years.
These moments also played Damon.
I just did that I was drinking a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the drunkest virgin ever seen.
Everyone knows it," said the judge in the execution of Matt Damon.
Earlier, Kavano was elected the U.S. High Judge.
Barbra Straisand found in her cloned dogs a strange behavior.
American singer Barbra Straisand stated that the clones of her deceased dog were quite different from the original animal.
"They don't look like them.
In fact, [the clones] look like it, but it's impossible to clon the soul," a 76-year-old singer stressed.
At the end of 2017, Straisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog Coton de Touréar, named Samantha, who had to sleep because of health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that the chouahua dog, called the Miracle Milly (Miracle Milly), was called the world's smallest dog, cloned at 49 times.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
U.S. reflected on the Russian naval blockade due to oil and gas transfers
In the United States, the Russian naval blockade can be launched to gain the advantage of the global energy market.
The American authorities have been so struggling for success in the world’s hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the Russian naval blockade, which remains one of the world’s major energy suppliers.
Ryan Zinke, head of the U.S. Ministry of Internal Affairs, described the possibility of the blockade on the day before.
Contrary to world practice, the United States Ministry of the Interior does not perform the civil functions, including the implementation of natural resources policies.
Therefore, the statement of Zinke was fully within the competence of the department headed by it, although it had not been deprived of political beauty.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke stated that the U.S. naval forces had controlled the seaways in the Middle East region and could block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need could be linked to Washington's desire to prevent Russian supply of the world energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia continued to receive a lion share of its income from the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the revitalization of Moscow in the region, as Zinke is sure.
The Minister explained that the United States continued to look forward to providing leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To that end, Washington will have to shatter Russia and Iran, and the sea blockade of trade routes, an acceptable measure on that path, believes Zinke.
Kalmish director received good feedback from the festival.
Our landman, actor of the Gogol Centre, Eugenius Sangajiev and his film "Harmony" ("Harmony"), has given special reference to the members of the jury of the sixth festival of the Debate Debate, which was held in Omsk.
It is a festival diploma that states that “this is a signal for the immediate response of major industrial players in the image movies”.
As we know, the picture of the young Kalmish director was presented in the short-term film program “Move. Start”, which included eight films.
The main prize in this competitive program was the painting "Jana is Ana vice versa" -- the Regisser debate actress They're Gladky.
The National Film Film Department is on a young film, but not on the age of makers, but on the state of their spirit, desire and ability to risk.
A graduate of the Elistine Arts School, P. Choncushova and RAT-GITISA, Eugenius Sanghajiev, meets all these requirements.
He's young, talented, creative, and in his creativity, he's looking for new, non-standard forms of self-expression.
More than 300 Syrians left the Idlib Deescalation Zone for day
The Idlib Deescalation Zone in Syria left 301 people for a day, including 141 children, reported on the evening of 29 September at the Conciliation Centre of the hostile parties.
The evacuation was through the Abuudd Duhur humanitarian corridor.
The centre also reported on the current tension in the deescalation zone.

Formula-1 Grant to Russia Gonka
Russia has a club that I keep track of.
John Terry, former Chelsea captain of England, about why he visited the Russian Spartacus championship (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I'm following.
I've been watching it very recently, and I've been interested in looking at it from the side.
I can't say I'm a chiller because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy to Spartacus, and I want to apologize for the decision, and I bring Terry's words to the Chelsea Hospital website.

The road violin was given to the lombard for the priceless
When a man in the Lombard LBC Boutique and Loan in the city of Somerville (Massachusetts) brought a violin for an old and unpredictable tool, the Lambard employee offered only $50.
But the experienced shop manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and turned to the expert for advice.
It turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galiano, estimated at $250,000.
Only the violin straps are estimated at $16 to $18,000.
The investigation found that the violin had been kidnapped by a resident of the city for some time, and the instrument had been returned to the lawful owner.
To date, it is unknown how the violin came to the man who gave it to the lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now everyone in the lombard violin will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the client.
At the Ninth tour, the RPL will be confronted with a fascinating confrontation: Spartacus will be hosted at his “Rostows” Stadium under the leadership of Valerie Carpina, a human being, as we know, is not a stranger to the “National Team”.
The fact that the clubs now have an equal number of glasses is 15, and they divide 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, stalling from the far-reaching Zenit and sitting in one eye from the "Crasnodar" that tomorrow plays with Dinamo.
The red and white now has a strip: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, and in the League of Europe, Masimo Carrera suddenly flew "Rapidu" and recently left the house "Ahmatu."
After derby with the CSSA, which ended fairly, Spartacus, with a minimum account, played at the Chernomorec Cube, and early on, to mention whether the most popular Russian club had approached the end of the crisis.
Three consecutive matches couldn't win, but they don't know five matches.
Let's see if Carpin's going to be able to extend the playless series with such a game of principle.
The previous Carpenian “Rostow” meeting with Spartacus concluded in favour of the capital team.
Start at 19:00.

The Lord helped Siberia today.
Vitzia's chief coach Valerie Bellov on the Siberia (3:4) defeat in the CCW regular championship match.
"Collega talked about Siberia's people, and I want to celebrate our championships," quotes the White Official Web site.
"I hope they will support the same, because now almost every game is full of stadium, a great atmosphere.
At the game, the Lord must have helped Siberia today because they've made a big mistake, especially our leaders.
Actually, we lost the micro-machine 0:3 of our leading leaders, so we found it difficult to get this match out, even though there were moments.
But anyway, I'll take the blame for it.
Because they probably missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was another team."
"It's a fabulous cucumber."
The audience is indignant by Augustine's choice on Golos show.
Golos 60+ is accusing Leonid Agutin's mentor in "the ugly cucumber and scumbag."
When he heard the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin from his earliest notes, he was hoping that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But son’s feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to his team.
At that time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the tutor's inexpensiveness at first stage.
But the "sculpture" is prolonged, and the star's father is absolutely unreasonably taking the place of more deserving performers.
Now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the show audience, were resented by the rude and frank pushing our loved ones to the final staircase.
I've even doubted that Agutina would be able and conscientious not to bring his dad to the end at the very first place," Irena Petrovska and Xenia Larina were reasoning on the TV Man program.
In the meantime, for his father, Leonid Agutin "sell" of the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nicolas Petrović whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what spectators still want to see on his father's show.
But it turns out not to be the case, audiences want an objective assessment and see in the finals really talented performers, and now Augustine discredited the show.
"Actuate the Goloss members of Agutina's team, they were doomed."
"The last time, Agutin showed how he loved Dad, and today he was supposed to be a professional."
"The conduit has lost its meaning."
"Remove two talented people from the project and leave their dad who doesn't sing but whisper as much as you can then call the mentor?"
"I like it likes dad sing, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert."
It's Golos show, not "Good Relatives."
“On the side of Agutin it was unprofessional.”
"Then we have to offer our own show to be a pope, not a show that's made for the money of Channel."
"It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why the unsound dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why did a worker from Surgut with a beautiful voice and temporal slipping, and Pope Agutin was brought to the finish?
And then we all complain that on stage and screens are the same faces for decades!
'Because you don't pump through the cucumber.'
"What did you expect?
It's Russia!
Around the blast and the cucumber.
And the money in the family budget is not too much!
The absurd theater goes on!"
The users also remembered that in one of the seasons of traditional Golosa, the son of Gross had come out on blind auditions.
Then the meter and the head didn't come to take the son into his own team.
Moreover, he said, "Come, get out of here, all right."
Agutin did not act like a professional.

Scientist described a possible scientific programme for RF expedition on the Moon
The head of the RAN Institute for Space Research, a member of the Correspondent RAN Anatoly Petrouković, told RIA Newsti about a possible programme of research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community was now developing the directions of such work.
“No consolidated opinion has yet been reached,” the scholar stressed.
He noted that one option was to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, thus avoiding interference with the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore space sources of radio radiation," added Petroukovich.
He also believed that the Moon could be used to conduct robotics tests and to use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for a primitive organic on Earth satellite, the scholar believes.
This could help to determine how life appears on planets.
Previously, Roscosmos, the head of the Corporation, said that the optimistic version of the RF could make a pilot flight to the Moon by 2030.
The offended client dropped the facal basket at the 7-Eleven store.
Damian Simms, 41-year-old St. Petersburg (Florida), called "ymel tooth" at the 7-Eleven network network manager, in May he expelled him from the shop for misconduct.
And he decided to vengeance his enemy in an original way.
At half a second night, he entered the store and fell on the floor and on a portion of the goods that had been brought to the basket.
The basket had feces and urine that Simms had borrowed from the nearby mobile biotuale.
The police officers coming to the scene arrested the “vent.”
He was imprisoned and released before bail for $300.
He was charged with illegal incursions into property and criminal offence, and was prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although the crime of Simms is rather funny than serious, the sentence may be severe enough because it has violated the law on several occasions, including large-scale stealing, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a car in intact condition and the abuse of animals.

In the United States, a possible Russian naval blockade
The United States may, as appropriate, establish a Russian sea blockade to prevent its supply of energy to the countries of the Middle East.
The U.S. Minister of the Interior Ryan Zinke said that.
Speaking at an industrial event in the United States town of Pittsburgh, the head of the department stated that for the Russian economy, the only source of income is the sale of energy and Moscow is pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas, as it does in Europe, says Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that this was the case with Iran.
For its decision, the Minister believes that there are two options for the development of events: military and economic.
He would prefer not to use the first, so pressure and dismantling Iranian energy resources should be put in place.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very hurt.
I couldn't do anything, and it was very hurt.
Sergei Sirotkin, a Russian pilot called Williams, commented on the outcome of the Gran Pré Russia race.
"In fact, I don't really want to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and on my second turn, I found myself between the two cars I was immediately stuck.
I lost all the positions I played at startup, the moment, right away.
I found myself in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others hit the pet-stop, we'd get into the clean air, and we'd go back, but there was no more rubber.
Plus was fighting a partner, and he was contacted too.
I understand he was a little mistaken.
We found ourselves in this situation on the most untrained season track, I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," quotes Sirotkin RIA "Nowthy."
Remember, Sirottkin had completed the 18th year in the Russian Gran Price race and had won the British Pilot "Mersedes" Lewis Hemilton.

The President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpischev commented on the removal of the Moscow Spartak footballists Denis Glushakova and Andrea Dzykónko from training with the basic composition of the post-frailing exercise to criticize the chief coach of the Massimo Carrera team, reports Sport Vikend.
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
Such things are incredible foolishness.
I totally disagree what Carrera is doing.
It's just deepening the frustration in the team.
First of all, these are verses, reading, and taking them as you can.
I wouldn't react to it at Carrera's place.
Everybody has an opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to shave.
If Glushakov and Dzynko are putting rabbits, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think that Italian lacks the flexibility of the situation.
And that doesn't serve the normal climate in the team.
Today Spartacus has no game, so this situation didn't need to be blown up at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at it together.
Spartacus has much to do with different lines, and there is inevitableness after the introduction of youth.
The relationship within the team does not seem to add optimism to this match," I'm sure Tarpishev.
The two teams will be held on 30 September and will begin at 7:00 in Moscow.
Earlier, Spartacus refused, John Terry led a youth team called Chelsea.
Scirius Speakers discussed natural-like technologies with scientists
Speakers of the Syrios Education Centre in Sochi, participants in the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists from the National Research Centre of the Kurchatov Institute.
The presentation by researchers was carried out within the framework of the Global Convergent and Natural Technologies Forum, organized in Sochi on behalf of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, reported on the educational centre website of 29 September.
The lecture opened a documentary film entitled Courchatov, during which the President of the Curchatov Institute, a Correspondent RAN Mikhail Kowalchuk described global challenges as a driving force for civilization.
Scientist's lecture is published on the Sirius website.
Schoolers have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
The organizers of the forum said that natural technologies that young scientists are currently working on would help solve this problem.
In addition, Covalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies and also highlighted the risks inevitably posed in the development of such technologies.
"The coming of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a huge benefit.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, which is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's the other side.
The development of natural-like technologies is in fact a technological reproducing of natural systems.
There's a negotiable side -- targeted intervention in human life.
The risk is always there.
A car came into existence -- people died under wheels.
But cars still use it.
The dual nature of technology is immediately.
I'm creating a medical new technology, and I can create weapons of mass destruction," quotes scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing the modern scientific breakthroughs, schoolchildren were able to ask questions to the meeting.
Speakers were the candidate for physics and mathematical sciences, the head of the NBICS Curchatov Environmental Technologies Corchatov Institute, Julia Diakova, and the leader of the NBICS-Technology Curchatov.
The Educational Center of Syríus in Sochi has been established by the Educational Fund "Talant and Success" on the Olympic Infrastructure initiative by President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
The aim of the educational centre is to identify early, develop and provide further professional support to gifted children.
Previously, in September, it was reported that all-Russian online warships on Cyberwiza's information security would be sent to Cyrius training.

Kazan's Russian submarine scared the United States.
The Russian Kazan submarine is the biggest danger to the U.S. fleet.
The American counter-admiral Dave Johnson said this, transmits Rosbalt with reference to The National Interest.
"We are threatened by a strong potential opponent.
It's enough to look at "Severodwinsk," he said, pointing to the predecessor model Kazani.
According to the Chief Commander of the US Navy in Europe, James Foggo, Russia has focused on modernizing its underwater fleet.
Macedonia: the referendum was not due to a low phenomenon
The referendum was intended to approve the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country to “Northern Macedonia”.
Greece objected to the use by Macedonians of the name of its historical province.
The name of the sulla of the former Yugoslav Republic opens the way to NATO and later to the EU.
But, as the EFE has said, only 34 per cent of the events on the Sunday plebiscite "drawn" to the constitutional threshold of 50 per cent.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, perhaps the authorities in Skopje would decide not to give up the renaming.
When speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the change of title of the Republic, said that if there were more “yes” among the votes, Macedonia would change the name in spite of the unreached quorum.

Kemerovs were indignant by a flock of rams on the cemetery
On 30 September, an eyewitness reported on a known Kemerov page on the social network that one of the local cemeteries was freely scattered by horned animals.
Animals passed between the fences and pinched the grass.
The commentators expressed different views: some local residents noted that there was no harm to the cemetery of small horned cattle and that their appetite could even help clear the land from the weeds and grass, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not feel that the behaviour of animals was:
"This is a grave, not a pastoral.
There's nothing for the rams to do.
You will not say to the rams that they roast, but it is not for them.’
In one way or another, one eyewitness observed that the problem of animals in the middle of the cemetery was already known, and the necessary measures would soon be taken.
How's it going to be?
There is no word to push.
That's right.
The word "squeeze" in the meaning of "train, influence, influence" is only influential, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "sufficiency."
We use that word to believe that it comes from the word "dissuasion."
But the pressure and the "satisfaction" are not only intimate but even in some way opposite.
Check it yourself.
It means "full, full, sufficient, sufficient for anyone or anything to satisfy."
Enjoyment, pleasure is family words.
He used to have the meaning of "no depending on anything, to be self-satisfying."
The old Slavic "dolly" is related to the words "hang" and "foot."
Giving, suppressing, that's different.
These words are truly terrifying "kindlings". Daos is a wolf (wolves dowling), deyja is "dea" and dvaidí is a "repression".
The same illusion as the words “destination” and “satisfaction”, as well as the inevitable obsoleteness of the latter, have forced them to become confined.
So we have the same "d" that we use in the letter using "a", which is, well, incorrect and impossible in terms of the processes of the emergence and development of those words.
So the right thing to do is get to it.
But it is an obsolete word that is no longer used in its right meaning.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative effect on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the pressure design, but remember that it's the office.

But it's unlikely to have had a significant impact on the outcome."
"Sochi's got very hard to chase, is it a key point to start a race?"
"Well, I'm sure you do, but you never know how it's going to work.
It's not gonna be easy anyway, because our car is marked by a slower Mercedes machine.

with the Syrian operation, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, some 100,000 terrorists have been killed, of whom 85,000 have destroyed the RF air and space forces.
This was described in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the VAC, Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Defence and Security Council, Victor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air-protection equipment: Air and space forces have attacked and continue to strike precisely terrorist targets.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria in three years - for example, ammunition warehouses, reinforcements and headquarters.
The Russian airstuffs broke the Djihadist Defense -- this has become a decisive contribution to the Syrian government troops, transmits Interfax.
But, according to Bondarev, our military operation in Syria has allowed Russia itself to protect against terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic were under the control of terrorist groups, including “Islamic State” (IG, prohibited in Russia) and “Jebhat al-Nusru” (forbidden in Russia).
According to the Genstaba of the Armed Forces of the RF, some 4,000 Russian civilians and about 5,000 post-Soviet citizens were fighting on the side of the IG.
And it is only those registered, not counting those who have not been identified, that they have emphasized Bondarov.
Most of them were trained and ready to take arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to enter our territory freely.
Thus, noted Bondarev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on far-reached borders -- otherwise this evil would be "have to us."

Mitropolitan Ilarion compared Kiev's decision to rename the UPC with the actions of fascists
Mitropolitan Ilarion, Head of the Foreign Church Division of the Russian Orthodox Church, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against the Jews.
"It's like in Fascist Germany that a Jew is wearing a yellow star, that means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and that's what this bill was set up for this purpose," said a Mitropolitan telecanal “Rossia-24” (Reciple on Interfax).
In his view, this step would have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict was in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to have full control of the CCP and to “protect it out of law”, the clergyman believes.
"It's a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church think they're Ukrainians, they're patriots of their country," he added.
It was previously known that the members of the Supreme Council were working to implement Bills No. 4128 (reforming the subjection of religious communities), No. 4511 (special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (reforming the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the CPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Deputy of the Pochaev Lauré called for the protection of the Orthodox and Ukrainian sanctuaries
Mitropolitan Vladimir, Vice-President of the Holy-Spain Pochaev Laurna, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and the Ukrainian sanctuaries.
The text of his address to believers in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UCP) was published on Saturday on the home site.
In various times of history, our predecessors and our relatives in faith and spirit had to profess their faith and protect their sanctuaries.
In view of the situation and the information we have, and the threats of the killings that are spreading, we can see that we too have to survive," said the Mitropolitan.
He asked for support — prayerful, moral.
The placeholder also stressed that "you're probably going to need your physical presence."
The priest added, "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, are threatened with a chastisement, and then we will protect our sanctuary."
Whoever is indifferent to the fate of the Orthodox Laur of the Orthodox Republic of Ukraine and the world’s sanctuary, must be prepared to protect it, says the address.
The Mitropolitan called against those who mislead the believers.
The UPC has a canonic status as determined by Tomos of 29 October 1990 by the Church's mother.
Now, someone wants to get into a position on the news patriarch and the friend of the Catholic pope of the Roman Bartholomew.
The new style, with its consequences, is unacceptable to us.
And we are pleased with the status our church has," said the placeholder of the laurel.
He recalled that the CPC had been a canonically independent and fully independent in its administration since October 1990.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchy.
In fact, Tomos has our church already.
What else do we need Tomos?" said the Mitropolitan Vladimir, calling on believers and all citizens to ask whether other religions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers have taken a measure of understanding and determined what temple they are going to go to.
But someone wants to sift hostility and strife again.
Some are envious that domes shine upon the temples which they want to destroy," the priest stressed.
The Cachaev laurel is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located at the top of the Pchayev Mountain, 70 miles [70 km] from Ternopolus.
The early historical record of it is at the beginning of the 13th century.

I liked the first period.
We didn't use some good moments.
During the second period, the rival slightly quelled us, and we endured.
But the removal of us is a little "fed."
Guys played great, did a coach.
I think if we keep playing right too, the winners will come.
They didn't kill them, they didn't win with zero heads, but the content of the game was right.
Good luck will come if we keep playing in that direction."
"In your view, "Autombilist" added compared to the meeting in Lower Novgorod?"
"Then it didn't play a foreign line.
At the pre-session, teams were able to handle other tasks, playing many young boys.
I think there was a completely different game, another hokkey.
Automobile is a good team.
On the tournament table, it's clear that the team is playing right.
A good hokkey, a kind atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
A lot of good players, there are leaders.
It's a good defense, a good gatemaker.
It was hard, we were cooking.
They knew that the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn't work."
