The rapid growing rate of cumulative coronary infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the British between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID19 has similar trends in the European/European Economic Area and in Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy offices, there is a need to increase the readiness of patients to swim with COVID-19, who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of pneumonia with unknown ethology were reported in Hubei Province of China, Uhan.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the infectious is a new type of coronavirus, now known as a coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronaviral infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80 per cent of people from COVID-19 have a light form of disease, i.e., in the form of respiratory paths with pneumonia or without it, with the majority of those who have been ill recovering.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop in a more severe form with the need for hospitalization and 6 per cent in the remaining 6 per cent take critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The rate of death of patients hospitalized with COVID19 is approximately 4 per cent.
The study analyses the trends in COVID-19 in each European Union (EU)/Economic Zone (EEZ) and in Britain and compares them with trends in the Hubei Province of China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEE and in Britain with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEU and Britain
Since the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and in the rest of the world, the COVID-19 pandemic is developing according to the same dynamic as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the Eurosurveillance issue of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID19 in Europe, which met the criteria for WHO to determine the existence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of them returning from Hubei Province of China.
As at 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEU countries and in Britain, from 31 December 2019 to that date, 39,768, and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750, including 1,441 deaths, were reported only to Italy.
Determination of cumulative quantities and cumulative morbidity COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 the number of reported COVID19 cases in each country around the world from official sources, such as the ministries of health in these countries, national and regional health administrations and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the dissemination of COVID-19 in the EU/EEU and in Britain and to compare them with data on Italy.
As an indicator of the proliferation of active cases, COVID-19 was calculated a complete cumulative morbidity of COVID19 for 14 days, taking into account the normal flow of COVID19 in each EU/EEEZ country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We have also submitted a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country as at 8:00 on 15 March 2020 compared to that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in development of COVID-19 in EU/EEU and British countries
Trends in the development of total COVID-19 cumulative morbidity for 14 days in EU/EEU and in Britain were generally consistent with trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (figure 1).
The COVID-19 cumulative morbidity in the EU/EEU and the British as a whole began to grow around 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 there was a sharp leap (additional material).
This was due mainly to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEE countries and in Britain, similar trends were observed for COVID-19 cumulative morbidity (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEW countries and in Britain compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEU countries and in Britain is comparable to that recorded in Italy for only about three weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEE and in Britain.
The observed trends of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable speed in all countries.
In spite of different stages in different countries, the differences in the responses taken by national public health authorities and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases of disease and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of the existence of COVID-19, including “verbal” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10 per cent of patients from COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive therapy offices in those regions had already been filled to the maximum extent.
Currently only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases (non-represented) are available for the patients from COVID-19 to hospitals and (or) intensive therapy offices in the EU/EEEA.
However, such information should be systematically collected in order to supplement current monitoring data, which are the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
According to a 2010-2011 study, the number of cokes in the intensive therapy offices and intensified care offices in Europe is significant, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive therapy offices and intensive care offices per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated ECDC report on the COVID-19 risk-estimation results presents scenarios for the downloading of health systems with estimates for the hospitalization of infected COVID-19 in each EU/EEE and in Britain, when the risk of a lack of accessible cracks in the intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are now grouped in certain EU/EEU and British regions and hospitals and intensified therapy offices usually serve the population of a territorial group, information on infections and the number of cocaves in intensive therapy offices is recommended to provide, wherever possible, for statistical purposes (NUTS-2) units at the 2nd level of Nomenclature of Territorial Units.
Italy ' s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic in the EU/EEU and Britain is rapidly developing.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensified therapy offices should be prepared for a scenario of contact infection of SARS-CV-2, which has not diminished for a long time, and to an increase in the number of patients from COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the last ECDC report on risk-estimation results, it is important to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 is an expeditious, proactive and integrated approach, with a subsequent transition from minimizing to minimizing, since given the projected rapid growth in the number of diseases in decision makers and hospitals, it may simply not be sufficient time to reflect, take and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The risk assessment report also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time in which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CV-2 and reduce their stress on their health systems.
If not, in the next days or weeks of the health system in other EU/EEU countries, patients will be affected by the influx of intensive therapy.
The outbreak of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID19) caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries, and the number of infected persons has exceeded 80,000.
Like the homologic SARS-CoV virus, which called the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from volatile mice and create similar symptoms, using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less serious and lower than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affected by older persons more than young than men and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article proposes a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethology, virusology, diagnosis, treatment, forecasting and prevention of the disease.
While many of the questions are yet to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (the New Year of China), which came out on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and memorable occasion for all Chinese who were urged to remain at home for and many weeks after the outbreak of a new virus infection.
In view of the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus SARS-CV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease by coronavirus infection of 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhang and spread rapidly throughout the country and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed COVID19 cases were identified, more than 40,000 patients were recovered and over 3,000 died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the enemy number one for society” and is potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 publications on COVID19, including articles on its virus, epidemiology, ethology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to compile the results of research in a new and fast-growing subject area.
To the extent possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus disease, the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), whose outbreak occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts of prevention and forecasting of the disease, as well as some other issues of equal importance.
Crown viruses have traditionally been among pathogens, which are not deadly to human beings and are mainly responsible for about 15 per cent of the total respiratory diseases of 4.
However, in this century, we have twice experienced high-pathogenic human coronators, that is, the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which have triggered the outbreak of disease in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and have soon spread to many other States with a horrible rate of disease and mortality.
Consequently, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in human history.
As shown in figure 1.1, the report of the clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received to the National Health Commission of the CIS of Whaan on 31 December 2019.
After seven days, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case in Wuhan was registered.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was known that medical workers had been infected and that it was possible to transmit the virus from human beings.
On 23 January, a quarantine was introduced in Uhuan, and urban public transport ceased.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of the disease, 21 out of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Huhan, which was considered a starting point for infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the coronavirus was a global emergency in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of the report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already penetrated some 50 other countries around the world (figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the degree of risk of outbreak have yet to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-central clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qqq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections were exposed to all age groups, but mostly to people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 and only 14 were still under 10 years of age.
Infiltration of SARS-CV-2 among men is higher (0.31/100,000) than among women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was distributed mainly by clusters in Hubei Province and in nearby regions.
On average, from the moment COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis, it took 5 (2-9) days.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 days (3.0 to 7.2).
From the time of the symptoms to death, the average time was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The reference rate for reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the revised R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of infected persons commensurate with large-scale transport transport on the eve of the Chinese New Year.
The death rate among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted death rate for patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were: sex (man), age (60) and severe pneumonia.
Crown viruses are a subsemy of large shell viruses containing one thread of the meaning RNA.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which the alpha and beta-corrupt viruses are known to strike people.
In the case of damage to coronavirus of type SARS and MERS, glycoprotein of schiposic (S) is linked to cell receptors of angiotensin converting type 2-e-type enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidiptidasis-4 (DPP4), respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
The cytoplasm is released by the virus RNA gene; after replicating the virus genome, the genome RNA, together with hull glycoproteins and nucleocapsis proteins, produces virion-containing visicules, which then combine with the membrane cell to release the virus.
The first reports on the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is determined to be a new type of betacoronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% of which coincides with 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease in the market for Juanan products in Uhaan.
Genetically, SARS-CV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
SARS-CV-2 particles were detected in ultra-tonic respiratory slices.
It has been established that the human enzyme ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-Protein SARS-CV-2 links to an ACE2 enzyme is weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to a lesser degree of gravity than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short life protein coded orf3b and secret protein encoded orf8.
Protein orf3b of the SARS-CV-2 virus can play some role in terms of the pathogenity of the virus and suppress IFN exposure; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the authors ' team, headed by Zhou (Zhou), submitted reports on the Cryoelectronic Tomography of a full-dimensional ACE2 enzyme with 2.9 ° in an amino acid compound with the transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed information, was assembled as a dimer and that ACE2-B0AT1 could link two S-protein, which is evidence of the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target for a medicinal screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate master
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mice from which the virus was transmitted to man through a circuit and camel, respectively.
The phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CV-2 with other coronaviruses revealed that the first SARS-CoV-2 masters were flying mice, since the new virus was 96% identical to the two SARS coronators, namely the coronaviruses of SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unknown what kind of intermediate master has made the virus able to overcome the type of barrier and contagion; the path to transmission is still to be found.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and his colleagues suggested that the transceivers of the virus from flying mice to man had become snakes, in which there was a homological recombination in S-protein.
According to their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou suggested that the Pangolins are long-distant mammals, who feed on the ants and who are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangolin crown and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent between both genomes is still very large, so final results with specific evidence are not yet available (figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely still unknown.
In the laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive within 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50% of humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus by ether, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfecting substances, peruxus acid, chloroform and other fatal solvents, but not chloroxydin.
The human population in general does not have immunity to SARS-CV-2, so people are receptive to the new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can refer only to the earlier studies of other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (figure 4).
As a general rule, the owner's virus first recognizes the inborn immune system by means of recognising receptacles (IRRs), including receptors of S-type Lectin, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes inflammation factors, dendritic cells and type I interferons, which curb the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophases against virus antigens.
However, the N SARS-CV protein could avoid immune reaction.
A adaptive immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the protection of the organism.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the generation of special antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill those affected by the cell.
T-halpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the functions of the T cells, causing their programmed loss.
Immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, MERS-CoV was neutralized by antibodies from a recovered patient.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local education of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious injury to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst scenario, lead to polyorganal inadequacy and even death.
The SARS-CV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older persons with associated pathology and pregnant women.
The likelihood of infection is higher for those who are exposed to a large number of viruses or who have violations of the immune system.
According to the study of the first 425 cases of infection in Huhan, the estimated average SARS-CV-2 incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period lasted three days, with a dispersion of between 0 and 24 days.
More recently, the survey, based on the demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time frame for quarantine measures to take into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus by those infected with the disease without symptom.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for persons who had contact with the virus or infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often the high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or be accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, obstructed breathing, muscle pain, headache, headache, throat, pestilence, chest pain, diarrhea, bulk and vomit.
Some patients had a breath and (or) hypoxia a week after the start of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease has progressed rapidly, and patients have developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
High temperature patients and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be tested for early diagnosis, even if there are no pathologies on the breast photographs.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following prevalence rates: 98 per cent high temperatures, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent rest and 3 per cent diarrhea; 8 per cent of patients needed artificial ventilation of lungs.
Similar results were derived from two recent studies of domestic infections and transmission of the virus from unsimtomatic infections.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also high temperatures (98%), dry coughs (47%) and food (55%).
However, 80 per cent of them required artificial venting of lungs, which is much higher than that of patients with COVID19, and corresponds to a higher MERS mortality rate than that of COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also had diarrhea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperatures (99-100 per cent), dry coughs (29-75 per cent), drain (40-42 per cent), diarrhea (20 - 25 per cent) and throat pain (13 - 25 per cent), and 14 - 20 per cent of patients need artificial ventilation.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2 per cent, and the total number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Compared to this, SARS death rate by November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of a more early study, the reference rate of reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47, with 95 per cent of the confidence interval (CI) between 5.71 and 7.23, while R0 for SARS-CV was only between 2 and 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV for symptoms, mortality and R0 is shown in table 1.1.
The above figures show that SARS-CV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate for the new virus is lower than the last two.
Thus, containment of the SARS-CV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Classes often occur when infected within one family or group of people assembled together for any reason or found themselves on a cruise liner, for example.
Patients were often travelling to Uhang, or to other affected regions, living there or contacting the infected or sick during the last two weeks prior to the beginning of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be carrying the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have been cured from the hospital may again become carriers of the virus, and this is a disturbing indication of an extension of the quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or lower number of white cells (especially lymphocytes) in peripheric blood.
For example, 1,099 patients from COVID-19 had lymphopia with 4x109/L levels of white cells, including 1×109/L, as well as a higher level of asparagin aminoferaza and viruses.
Some patients have detected higher levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients have high levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cells.
Patients with severe leakage have a D-dimer, blood fibrine breakdown, and lymphocytes have been constantly decreasing.
Most of the patients from COVID-19 have detected pathology with uneven eclipses on both sides or eclipses of the type of volatile glass in the lungs in X-rays.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, severe pneumonia, and acute respiratory disease (ODS).
In the development of ODS, uncontrolled inflammation, accumulation of liquid and progressive fibrosis lead to significant gas exchange disruption.
The diffusion of type I and II pneumonia reduces the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface tensions, thus reducing the ability of the light to expand and the risk of falling the lungs.
Thus, the worst X-ray results are often the same as the most serious cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the humidity of pneumonia, the formation of hyalin membranes and inter-plastic lymphociary infiltracy, and multinuclear syncial cells in light patients who died from disease correspond to the pathology of virus infection and ODS and similar to those found in SARS and MERS patients.
As the main criterion for diagnosing COVID-19, the RNA SARS-CV-2 method was used through a polymeralse chain reaction with the reverse transciptasis (CDC with reverse transcryptaz).
However, given the high level of counterproductive results that can accelerate the epidemic, China began to diagnose on the basis of clinical manifestations (not relying exclusively on the PCBs with the reverse transcryptaz) since 13 February 2020.
The situation of SARS diagnosed was similar.
Therefore, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results.
On 14 February 2020, Mr. Feng Zhang, a team of specialists, led by Mr. Feng Zhang, described the SHERLOCK-repetition methodology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows for the identification of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs at a density of 20 x 10–18 moles/l up to 200 x 10–18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) by means of indicators strips less than one hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new method, if successfully tested in clinical medicines, can significantly improve the sensitivity and convenience of tests.
Owing to the lack of experience in countering the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide patients with COVID-19 with only supportive therapy while trying to apply any therapeutic methods used or offered for other coronavirus treatments, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (table 2).2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of anti-virus drugs, immunity providers, steroids, survivors ' plasma, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was suggested that even the plasma of the healing patients be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are hurried to develop antibodies and vaccines to combat the virus.
In the initial phases of SARS-CV-2, it is mostly light and may be less affected by other bodies expelling ACE2, such as ventriloquism and kidneys.
Nevertheless, the disruption of work and the refusal of breathing organs are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
In order to facilitate symptoms and save lives, therefore, it is critical to support the respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, noninvasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical voltilation of lungs, which are assigned according to the gravity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modified extrapulmonary blood transfusion techniques used for treatment that pose a threat to the life of heart or breathing deficiencies.
In addition, the maintenance of water balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks, as well as the protection of functions of vital bodies, is essential for patients with SARS-CV-2.
It is known that the cytokin storm is the result of hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
The Cytokin Storm is the form of a system-wide inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNה and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release huge amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of ODS and polyorganal inadequacy.
The suppression of immunity is essential in treating the cytokin storm, especially patients in difficult condition.
Corticosteroids and tocysumab were used to treat the cytokin storm, monochlonal antibodies serving as an inhibitor of interleikin 6.
Other treatments for cytokin storms based on suppression of immunity include the immune response modules aimed at controlling T cells; the IFN- cytokines, IL-1 and TNF blockade; the denial of Janus-Kinasa; the use of cytomaba, 4 cytokin signal compressors and gystondeatelaza inhibitors.
To reduce the gravity of the effects of inflammatory processes in treating SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immunity applicants.
However, steroids in large doses do not benefit in treating severe pulmonary damage to patients from SARS and COVID19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonicrosis, which significantly worsen the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium-sized dossiers are recommended for use with caution in treatment of patients from COVID-19 in critical condition.
At the time of writing, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the internal introduction of a remdecivier, a nucleotide analog, has proved to be effective treatment by a U.S. patient with COVID19.
Remdeciviir is a recently developed anti-virus drug originally developed by Gilead to treat Ebola and Marburg virus diseases.
Later, the Remdesiver also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with one-chain RNAs, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these data, the Gilead company provided this medicine stock of China to conduct Парal Studies on SARS-CoV-2 patients and looks forward to the results of these studies.
In addition, a baricininib, α-interferon, latinauir/ritovire and fishermen were offered as options for therapy of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combined treatment with lopinvira/ritonvira may be accompanied by diarrhea, boil, vomit, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other medicines assigned to patients should be monitored with caution.
The plasma of recovering patients and the development of antibodies
The heating of blood from contagious patients has long been used to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect the healthy population.
And in fact, the blood of recovering patients often contains a relatively high number of antibodies to fight pathogens.
Antitela is in an immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogens molecules and addressably neutralize them.
On the basis of this premise, a plasma was made available from the blood samples of a group of patients who were cured of COVID19, which was then introduced to 10 patients who were severely ill.
During 24 hours, their symptoms improved, their inflammation decreased, their virus load, and their blood saturation increased with oxygen.
However, in order to suggest that this method should be used extensively before the special therapy is carried out, it is required to continue to be tested without any explanations made.
In addition, certain shortcomings in the use of plasma should be carefully explored in the light of the therapeutic effect.
For example, antibodies can overly stimulate the immune system and cause cytokin emissions syndrome, which, given toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually not high, and plasma for patients in critical condition requires much.
It is not easy to develop and make specific antibodies fast enough to overcome the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and more practical to identify B-cells of recovered patients and to identify genetic codes of effective antibodies or to conduct screening to find effective antibodies against critical proteins of virus.
That's how we can get to the mass production of antibodies.
For millenniums, Chinese used traditional medicine to treat different diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on the combination of multiple components of the formula, which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect because it is difficult to identify and verify these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy, COVID-19 is one of the main alternatives to treatment of patients with a light and medium degree of symptoms or to patients who are recovering after a serious illness.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and the Lyan Hua Zin Wen capsules were recognized as effective in COVID-19 treatment.
The largest percentage of surviving patients from COVID-19 were in several provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for 87 per cent of patients, including in Ghana (63.7 per cent), Ninja (50 per cent) and Hunany (50 per cent), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used to treat only about 30 per cent of patients from COVID-19, the lowest percentage of those who were rehabilitated (13 per cent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, since the evaluation should take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the level of their illness.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published studies that compared treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment for Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the deadlines for normalization of body temperatures, the removal of symptoms and medical care in the hospitals were fewer for patients who were treated by combinations of Western and Chinese traditional medicines than for patients who were treated only in Western medicines.
Most remarkable is the fact that the proportion of patients who have begun to deteriorate the symptomism (from light to heavy) has been lower in the group treated by a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in a group treated only by Western techniques (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the death rate in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
Nevertheless, the efficiency and security of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely monitored research conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
A certain interest is also the receipt, whenever possible, of an action mechanism and an explanation of the effectiveness of the components used in Chinese traditional medicine techniques or their combination.
Patients who have been suspected or confirmed that COVID-19 is mostly feared by acute or even deadly disease, and people closed to quarantine are also bored, lonely and extremely irritated.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxy and cough, as well as by-products such as sleeplessness from corticosteroids can be even more disturbing and psychological stress.
At the early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus, a number of psychiatric diseases were reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotoral incitement, psychotic symptoms, deliria and even suicide.
Mandatory monitoring of contacts and quarantines, which are among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase the anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social climate in their families and friends.
Psychiatric and psychiatric assistance should therefore be provided to patients with COVID19, persons suspected and contacted, as well as to all the others required.
Within the framework of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric assistance teams should be formed, clear information should be made with regular and accurate updates of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in interrupting the chain of transmission from animal bearers and infected persons to sensitive hosts and are often used in addition to the antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work was undertaken on the establishment of S-protein-based vaccines aimed at the development of long-term and highly active antibodies and (or) protection immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal vaccines from SARS viruses have been developed livingly weakened.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in the natural environment in which they are applied to aged patients, the model for the infection of deadly doses, and the level of protection against the infection of zonos.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new case has since been reported.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the MERS virus originating in the Middle East and spreading to other regions as a result of the conservation of zoning sources in endemic habitats continue to occur.
In order to combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using vaccinated virus, DNA plasmide, virus vectors, nano-parties, virus particles and recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies have been evaluated for animals.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for persons without immunity is an urgent and critical task requiring a solution to curb the uprising epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long term (average of 18 months) necessary for vaccine development and the dynamic change of the coronavirus.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical flow of the disease by thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also linked to the high frequency of complications and high mortality among patients with severe leaks.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a prognosis model to determine the priority of their actions, especially in areas where there is a lack of resources.
Based on the current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or relate to patients with COVID19 ' s forecasting of the disease (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the forecasting of the disease caused by SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is largely affected by patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
The patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have basic diseases and complications and were much older than patients who did not need such therapy (average 66 years versus 51 years), which shows that age is a prognotic factor for patients with COVID19.
Gender: SARS-CV-2 infection among men is higher than among women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as mentioned above.
Illness and complications: patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop a severe damage to myocardium and arithmia.
Cardiological phenomena were also the main cause of the death of SARS patients.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to ACE2 corridors, which could result in a disruption of the liver in patients with COVID19.
It is worth noting that age and initial diseases are closely interconnected and can distort results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the gravity of the inflammatory process or damage to tissues and is proposed to be considered a potential prognostic factor in the flow of disease, therapy response and final recovery.
It was also suggested that the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the degree of gravity of the disease and the projection of COVID-19 should be taken into account.
In addition, the result can also be predicted by a higher level of lactatdehydrogenase, amino-aminospheres, alanin-aminoferazes and creatinkinaza.
These enzymes are released in large quantities by different organs, especially the heart and the liver, and they are released when the tissues are damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiovascular or liver disorder.
Key clinical symptoms: To predict results and complications in COVID-19 treatment, other factors should take into account X-rays of the breast and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are immunity sponsors widely used in infectious diseases as supplementary therapy to reduce the gravity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe SARS, many of the survivors have developed avascular osteonecrosis, which has caused life disability and low quality of life.
Thus, if it is necessary to use steroids to treat patients from COVID-19, these drugs should be assigned in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, to deal with high degrees of uncertainty and to observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
Psychological advice and long-term support must be provided to such patients in order to reduce their stress and help them to return to normal life.
According to the demographic studies currently undertaken, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to reproducing in lower respiratory ways, the SARS-CV-2 virus, like other coronavirus that cause common cold diseases, can reproduce successfully in upper respiratory paths and cause weak symptoms or not cause symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients with an early or incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus on a significant scale, making it difficult for epidemiological controls to control.
However, it was believed that the transmission of the SARS-CV virus occurs when patients are severely ill, with the fact that in most cases there were no early infections.
Thus, the current COVID-19 epidemic is far more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently undertaking a great deal of work in which a general quarantine has been declared in Huhan and neighbouring cities, as well as extending the carantine regime for almost all the population, which has been introduced to stop the circulation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
While these measures have been severely harmful to the economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients identified is declining, suggesting a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the phase of draining will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Wonder) and his colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which seemed much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the group Ira Longini (Ira Longini) developed a model for forecasting the end of the epidemic and suggested that two thirds of the world ' s population could be affected by the SARS-CV-2 virus.
The Canadian Team of Specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been detected in nose and throat brains taken from patients who had recovered and had been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to that of influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently being applied may have been exerted.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola fever was to strike up to a million people and cause half a million deaths.
However, severe quarantine and isolation eventually led to control of the disease.
It is likely that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be weakened and that it will disappear or become a less pathogeneous virus coexisting with man over time.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of coughing or chewing, as well as possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been detected in the potassium, which means that the oral-fecal way of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of the 138 students may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously detected diseases and 40 medical personnel.
Thus, serious precautionary measures should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even foreigners, who contact or are infected.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of masks for the person; and surgical masks and respirators of class N95 (Seria No. 1860s) help to monitor the spread of viruses.
Surgeon masks prevent microcoples from flying away from potentially infected in the air and from situating on the surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the surroundings.
However, only N95 masks (Seria No. 1860s) can protect from inhalation of virians of 10 to 80 nm, they only pass 5 per cent of viriones; SARS-CV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, and they are both approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks combined, medical personnel directly contacting patients must wear class N95 (Seria No. 1860s) masks rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical workers should wear a protective coat of a figure to further reduce contact with viruses.
The viruses can also go into the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor had been infected by SARS-CV-2 despite wearing a class N95 mask; the virus might have fallen into the body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health workers should also wear transparent personal shields or closed shields.
All people in the affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more often by dehydrating their hands by dehydration, to avoid leaving their homes by self-isolating, and to limit their contacts with potentially infected persons.
The distance to the patient is considered a suitable distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was previously unknown to mankind, the high degree of similarity with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, was to be a disturbing signal for China, taking into account the experience it had gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 had the Director of the Ouhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens, noting that the new virus had a low degree of contagiousness and limited reproduction in the transfer from human beings to human beings and that prevention and control of the disease would not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially during the period when the whole country was preparing for the celebration of the Chinese New Year, and the critical time had been lost when the disease could be curtailed within Uhuan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can learn this drastic lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitudes and decisions; (2) monitor and respond to unusual information from the clinic rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take stronger measures to deter the potential epidemic at the early stages of its development rather than to soothe the public; and (4) conduct more focused and effective teachings to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and regularly monitor and improve public response.
The COVID-19 explosion, caused by previously unexplored coronavirus of the severe acute second-type respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease reached all China and spread to 50 countries around the world at the time of writing.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS relapse.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are relevant in terms of controlling the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 is more affected by older persons than young people and men to a greater extent than women; the proportion of serious cases and mortality rates among older persons is also higher than among young people.
Mortality resulting from SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomous, while SARS patients usually infect ambient patients only in severe cases, so to contain COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This in part explains why SARS-CV-2 is spreading far faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have a negative usual sample of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients can show positive tests on the virus again.
All of this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
In the background of such rapid progress in research, COVID-19 remains unresolved some of the most important issues, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of a 96 per cent homologist between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronavirus of volatile mice, we still cannot argue that SARS-CV-2 infections have occurred from flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate species that passed the virus from the original master, such as flying mice to man?
Without the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot be sure to interrupt the path of transfer, and the epidemiological situation may increase at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical samples have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus being introduced into respiratory cells and leading to further pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the ACE2 cells in other bodies?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically in the process of transferring from human to human?
Will it cause the world pandemic, also as SARS, or will it periodically relapse like influenza?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but time will take to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
The Zoonic Origin of the Coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CV) and their carriers, including people, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human coronavirus (HCV) were known to cause a light disease, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our notion of how catastrophic and life-threatening can be from human coronavirus.
The emergence of a coronavirus of second-type severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 once again attracted attention to the coronavirus and astonished us with the high transmission, but weaker the pathogenicity of the virus than that of the SARS-CoV.
Coronavirus infection is a zonosis, and understanding of its zonous origin will be of great benefit.
Most of the human coronators are from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
The intermediate stockpiles of certain human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of animal bearers directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of animals carrying coronavirus can also shed light on the pathogens of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we present the available data on the seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoning origin and ways of interspecies.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing the different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the coronavirus disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also addressed.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful change of the carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the gravity of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses are part of the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of siege viruses with one positive polar line of RNA.
These viruses with the largest RNAs containing genomes containing between 26 and 32,000 nucleotides have been named because of their form, which is similar to the crown when being examined under the electronic microscope.
In terms of structure, the coronavirus contain unsegmented genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading limits (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are broadcast in polyproteins of replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further redesigned to generate 16 non-structured proteins identified by nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading framework for structured proteins, including chipose protein (S), hull protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of linear excellence proteins have also been encoded in other coronavirus lines.
On the basis of the differences in protein sequences\ coronavirus are divided into four types (alpha, beta, gamma and delta-corruption viruses), with the type of beta-coroneviruses consisting of most of the human coronavirus and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betacoranvirus are volatile mice and rods, whereas birds are the main reservoir for gamma and delta-corruption viruses.
For thousands of years, the coronavirus have continually overcome intersectoral barriers, some of which have evolved to dangerous pathogens for human beings.
To date, seven human coronavirus have been known.
These include the human alphabetical viruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The remaining five betacoronavirus include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, the coronavirus of heavy acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CV), the coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type II SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronators HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause symptoms of light form such as cold and (or) diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV viruses, MERS-CoVs and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogens, causing severe communicable diseases of lower respiratory paths in relatively larger patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory disease (ODS) and extra-legal symptoms.
The first human coronavirus, HCV-229E, B814, was obtained from a sample of patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has provided more knowledge of HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 viruses, which have caused local infection symptoms.
Indeed, before the outbreak of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronary infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; over 8,000 people were ill and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic on the Arabian peninsula, with the disease sporadically spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus found in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the instigator of the current 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19), which, as at 3 March 2020, killed more than 3,20, and the number of infected persons exceeded 91,000.
An alarm was received and the world must be prepared for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus have a zonous origin, and their sources are flying mice, mouses, or domestic animals.
Numerous data sets testify to the evolutionary nature of all human coronavirus from volatile mice to organisms in which viruses are well adapted and which do not display pathogenic properties but demonstrate widespread genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic left China and the world with a severe medical, scientific, social and moral challenge.
A study of the zone-based mechanism of the origin of the coronaviruses will help to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting inter-vidence transfer.
It may also prompt or expedite the search for a container, intermediate and amplified SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on zone origin, inter-vidence transfer and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we identify and consider the following general feature: the root viruses from which human coronavirus have occurred are usually not pathogens to their reservoirs, but become pathogenic after the inter-visual transfer of the new bearer.
We also analyse the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which increased transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also being considered in the same context.
Animal coronavirus has been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first time the strain B814 of HCV-229E was obtained from a sample of patients who had a cold strain, various coronavirus were found from different infected animals, including indices, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronators have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 informs and illustrates the brief history of the discovery of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of HCV-229E was obtained from samples taken from respiratory paths of patients with an infectious upper respiratory path in 1966; further, the virus was adapted to the reproduction of the lung cell lines WI-38.
The patients infected with HCV-229E had cold symptoms, including headaches, chewing, general malnutrition and pain in the throat, with high temperature and coughing in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was released from organic culture and the subsequent serial passage into the brain of mice-susks.
The clinical symptoms of HCV-OC43 virus infection are similar to HCV-229E, symptoms of which are indiscriminately affected by other pathogens such as influenza viruses of type A and rinvirus.
Both HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 virus are spread throughout the world and are generally transmitted in winter in moderate latitudes.
For the most part, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to the research conducted by volunteers, a common cold of light form has been developed for healthy people infected with HCV-229E.
Only a few patients with weak immunity have severe infectious lower respiratory paths.
The SARS explosion, also known as the “Atypical Pneumonia epidemic”, was the first pandemic well documented by the human crownvirus, and the instigator of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third human coronavirus detected.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and across continents.
Without the exception of super-active distributors, it was calculated that each patient could contract about two more people; the incubation period was between 4 and 7 days and the peak of the virus load was 10 days.
SARS-CoV patients initially suffered from muscle pains, headaches, high temperatures, general malnutrition and refrigeration, while a diet, cough and breathing deficiencies were among the later symptoms.
Laboratory deviations from SARS are lymphopia, liver-proof violations and increased creatinkinase.
Patients with SARS also experience diffузal alveolar damage, proliferation of epitelial cells and increased macrophases.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical venting.
In such difficult cases,\ in addition to the lower respiratory paths, other bodies, including the organs of the cotton, liver and kidney, may also be infected, usually accompanied by a cytokin storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with reduced immunity.
For the first time, the virus was released from the open biopsy of a patient’s relative who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made to study the human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
It was first found that it was largely affected by young children, older persons and patients with weak immunity and respiratory diseases.
For HCV-NL63, there are such symptoms as moisture, conditionality, high temperature and bronchiolith.
Another independent study describes the distribution of the same virus from the nasal material taken from an eight-month boy from the Netherlands suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but it's actually widespread.
HCOV-NL63 is estimated to be responsible for approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases and the peak of the diseases that they cause is due to the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to a destructive laringath, which is also referred to as a sculpture.
HCoV-HKU1 was allocated to Hong Kong in the same year for a 71-year-old male hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolith.
In addition to an extra-creational pneumonia and bronchiolith, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with aggravating astmatic diseases.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, a light respiratory disease has been detected worldwide.
All the four coronavirus of persons causing extra-curricular infections have been well adapted to people and their mutation, resulting in high-pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents have been unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent HCoV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infectious lower respiratory paths in China.
These human coronaviruses are usually less virulent or pathogenic when they acquire the ability to communicate effectively and maintain themselves in the human body.
The coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first allocated to Saudi Arabia for the first time in 2012 from a light 60-year-old patient with severe pneumonia and renal deficiency.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia, there have been hostilities and proliferation through episodes of secondary infections in close contact.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical manifestations of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resemble the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), both of which have a progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal deficiency, which still distinguishes MERS from the other diseases caused by coronavirus transmitted to man.
More than 30 per cent of patients have diarrhea and voracy symptoms.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratoryly confirmed cases of high-mortal Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4 per cent), therefore MERS-COV is one of the most deadly viruses known to man.
Between mid-December 2019, the Hubei Province of China revealed pneumonia clusters that are now linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued outbreak of infectious lower respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 was a global emergency in the field of public health, and that the disease itself was known as “COVID-19” (COVID).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were reported worldwide, with about 3.4 per cent deaths.
It should be noted that the death rate is 4.2 per cent in Hubei Province of China and 1.2 per cent outside.
SARS-CoV-2, like SARS and MERS coronators, is causing severe respiratory infections, characterized by temperature, cough, and whirlwind.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and has the potential for rapid respiratory syndrome.
Despite the similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82 per cent), these viruses, however, form different branches of the philogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogeneous but has more transfer capacity than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CV-2 has been registered, indicating the ability of the virus to spread rapidly throughout the world.
Comparisons and comparisons between SARS-CV-2 and the other six human coronators reveal important similarities and differences.
First, the coronavirus transmitted to the person have similar incubation periods and the length of the disease caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coronators.
Secondly, in terms of the gravity of the symptoms, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus that cause extra-curricular infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CV-2 infections are similar to those most commonly observed in human coronavirus infections, including non-special infections, light symptoms, or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in SARS-CV infections, a small subgroup of serious COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, SARS-CV-2 also highlights interesting patterns of both human coronavirus and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronavirus, causing extra-curricular infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be verified whether the transmission of SARS-CV-2 is decreasing with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. every next person) as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronavirus that cause extra-curricular infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in samples of cala.
We have yet to answer the question of whether the feminine oral path of transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is as significant (at least under certain circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The possible seasonality of SARS-CV-2, characterized by human coronavirus, with extra-curricular infections, is of particular interest.
However, the future development of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogens and sustainable proliferation after human transition.
All four human coronavirus that cause extra-curricular infections with light-form symptoms have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, it may be people who have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both can be described as the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
The human coronavirus, causing serious diseases, and the people who are causing serious diseases, have simply failed to survive.
In order to do so, the human coronavirus must be replicated in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations that are opposing the driver ' s limitations.
In that sense, the longer the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 will continue and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus will be fully adapted to human beings.
If it is adapted well, it will be difficult to stop it through carantine or other controls of infectious diseases.
Over the years, the population has been circulating four extra-critical coronavirus that cause a common cold among people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
High-patogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to human beings sufficiently, and their transfer to people cannot be supported.
They need to keep and reproduce in their zoning reserves and look for cases of perceptive human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or intensified carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four HCV extra-curricular viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as HCV, at least at present.
But it's more pathogeneous than HCV, and less pathogens than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to human beings and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a container or an intermediate animal bearer.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV viruses, we will be useful to discuss definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, reinforced and reservoired viruses of HCV.
The animal serves as an evolutionary bearer of HCV if it transfers a closeborn ancestry with the same high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
Ancestor virus is usually well adapted and nonpatogenic in that medium.
Similarly, the reservoir is constantly carrying HCV for a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCV or its parental virus.
Unlike this, if HCV was only placed in an intermediate medium right before or about the time the man was taken, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zonous source of human infection and play a role as an intensified carrier, allowing the virus to be replicated lightly and then transmitted to people by increasing the rate of infection.
HCV may carry the deadlock infection if it is unable to withstand the transmission inside the intermediate medium.
On the contrary, HCV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes the natural container.
The epidemiological data retrospective showed that a zero SARS patient had contact with hunting and fishing animals (wild).
Further research on surfing has shown that the prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS-CV virus is higher than that of the general population.
The Himalayan cives (Paguma larvata) and the еноtoвидal dog in the wildlife markets have become the first to be installed virus bearers, such as the almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that, following the destruction of all market cigarettes, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan cigarettes living in nature or in farms and not marketed were not, in most cases, determined by SARS-CoV, leading to the conclusion that the Himalayan cive could only serve as an intermediate aggravating medium rather than a natural SARS-CoV reservoir.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that intermediate reinforcers can also serve many small mammals.
They all appear to be impasse bearers of the SARS-CoV virus.
Subsequent searches for natural animal bearer SARS-CV have identified a closeborn CoV volatile mice, which has been called a typical pneumonia-related coronavirus of underflying mice HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present with Chinese powdered volatile mice.
These mouses are positive to the antibodies of SARS-CoV and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other coronavirus of volatile mice have the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundations for a new concept that volatile mice became the carriers of new human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) have also been identified in volatile mice, but none other than one that stands for WIV1, cannot be isolated as a living virus.
The receptor SARS-CoV is known to be a human angiotensing enzyme 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1 produced from a sample of flying mice uses ACE2 volatile mice, cives and man as a receptor for entering the cell.
Interestingly, serums of well-being patients from SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closest parent of SARS-CoV in volatile mice, dividing 95 per cent of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, WIV1 is generally not an immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and volatile mice is not a direct reserve bearer of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis takes MERS-CV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 volatile mice and CoV-HKU5 volatile mice.
CoV-HKU4 volatile mice and MERS-CV use the same receptor of the medium, dipeptyl-peptiptidasis-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase of MERS-CoV virus is philogeneticly closer to the betacoronavirus sequences of volatile mice detected in Europe and Africa.
To date, wild volatile mice have not found the MERS-CoV virus alive.
The nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its nearest relative CoV-HKU25 are only 87 per cent.
So flying mice might not be the direct reservoir of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that one-rake camels are seropositive of neutralizing antitellas specific to MERS-CoV, as well as camels of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The living MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in human beings, was identified from the nostrils of single-rope camels, further confirming the role of camels as true MERS-CoV reservoirs.
It is also worth noting that camels who were experimented with MERS-CoV have had minor symptoms, but massive viruses.
It is noteworthy that infected camels have not only provided the virus by respiratory means but also by a fecal-oral way, which is also the main means of allocating the virus to volatile mice.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been contacted with camels before symptoms arise and are likely to refer to human transfers or transfers by unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are MERS-CoV carriers.
The nucleotides of SARS-CV-2 coincide with the Rhinolophus affinis of the Rhinolophus volatile mice in Asia.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 is too large to attribute parental relations to them.
That is, the volatile mice could not be the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical coronators of volatile mice were found in the future.
The direct animal bearers of the SARS-CV-2 virus are likely to be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Huhan Opto market of seafood, which has been associated with many of the initial COVID-19 cases, indicating the possibility of transfer from an animal person.
A number of recent studies based on the metagenic sevenation concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as the Pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry parent betacoronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
The homologies of the nucleotides of these new genomes of the pangolin coincide with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RATG13, with the nucleotide sequence identity of about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two differentiations of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in the philogenetic tree, one of which has a domain receptacle closer to SARS-CV-2, with an identity of 97.4 per cent amino acid sequences.
Conversely, RSD strains of SARS-CV-2 and RATG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of genome-based homologies.
A more early study of Pangolin patients also reported the definition of virus contigues in light samples, which were similarly related to SARS-CV-2.
The study used other methods to collect and manually process a genome sequence, which included about 86.3 per cent of the fully disproportionate virus genome.
The possibility of pangolin becoming an intermediate animal bearer of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded.
However, as a result of the diversification of sequences between SARS-CV-2 and the betacoronaviruses of the pangolins, relatives SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CV-2 from the pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is further shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacorn-viruses of the Pangolins associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CV-2 for volatile mice, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest homology of sequences was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronevirus of the Pangolins, the SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide homologies.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the betacoronavirus of the Pangolins, the relatives of SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is linked to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal favours a recombination between the betacoronavirus of the Pangolins, the SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widespread among the betacoronevirus.
There is still no final decision on the direct zoo origin of SARS-CV-2.
In addition to high-patogenic HCV viruses, the zonosis of HCV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
Phylogenetic evidence shows that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E can occur from volatile mice crowns, while parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are found from rodents.
It was reported that the coronavirus of volatile mice, called ARCV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and found from the North American three-coloured adjacent, showed a close relationship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCV-229E is genetically linked to another coronavirus of volatile mice called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was suspicion that its intermediate wearer might be also camel.
To make it clear, modern knowledge of the origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in figure 1 and table 2.
The philogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of the inter-speed transfer of HCV in anamnes.
When the HCV-OC43 virus was transmitted in between species and domestic animals in about 1890, there was a respiratory infection pandemic.
The history of HCV-229E is not so clear.
The alpha-coronon-viruses of volatile mice, NHCV-229E, were discovered.
Between them is the alpacular virus of the alpacacas.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to man.
First, it was people, not the alpacians, who could contact flying mice in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alpacas.
Secondly, the alpha-coronating viruses of volatile mice, related to HCV-229E, have varied and non-patogenic flying mice, while the alpha-coronavirus of the Alpaca has caused a respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alpaca alpakine virus was not found in wild animals.
Thus, the likelihood of the alpacacs obtaining HCV-229E from people cannot be excluded.
In fact, flying mice is a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the virus of madness, the Ebola virus, the Nepah virus and the Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that the mice could directly transmit HCV-229E to people.
On the other hand, while the alpha-coronating viruses of volatile mice could serve as a gene pulse of HCV-229E, the alpacas and the one-rb camels could be intermediate carriers to transmit viruses to people, as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-COV is an excellent example of inter-visual transfer from flying mice to one-rope camel and one-rope camel to man.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CV virus from volatile mice is known by its initial identification and subsequent research has been confirmed.
Obviously, flying mice provides a rich pool of varieties of viruses for inter-visual exchange of manned fragments and inter-vident transmissions.
Long-term, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and flying ability make flying mice “the ideal propagator”.
On the other hand, the MERS-COV virus was introduced to one-rope camel a decade ago.
He has adapted well to these camels, which from the intermediate medium have become a stable and natural reservoir.
These animals have a MERS-CV virus that causes a very light disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episode is an accident, and man remains the deadlock bearer of MERS-CoV because it is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CV-2 virus is different.
In particular, the betacoronavirus of pangolins are highly patogenic in the pangolins.
They may be tupic bearers of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as cives in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, several possibilities for inter-speed transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from human beings should be confirmed or deleted.
First, volatile mouses can be a reserve for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CV-2.
People can share ecological niche with flying mice through carbon production or the slicing of carcases of these animals.
Secondly, the Pangolins may be one of the intermediate reinforcers to which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
People are infected with the virus through the slice of carcasses and the meat of wild animals.
It is likely that many animals, including households, are receptive to SARS-CoV-2.
An animal survey on antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CV-2 could take place in a third form, which contacted both volatile mice and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to various types of animal bearers, three major factors from the viruses have also contributed to crossing inter-speed barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with one-chain RNAs, the calculated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be regarded as “supervised-high” with average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 replacements per year at one section 2, depending on the adjustment phase of the coronavirus to new masters.
Crown-viruses have a remedial extorinuclea, whose removal leads to extremely high mutation and deterioration or even incapacity.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog Remdecivivir suppresses the replication of coronaviruses by injecting this extorisononuclea and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymeras.
Remdeciviir is one of the most promising tools against SARS-CoV-2 that need to be verified in clinical research.
Nevertheless, the mutations of the coronavirus are almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the mutation rate can often be even higher if the coronavirus are not well adapted to the bearer.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 appears to be lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus is likely already adapted to another person-friendly bearer.
In addition to SARS-CV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, well adapted to single-rope camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that vaccines and anti-viral drugs from SARS-CoV-2 will quickly lose their effectiveness as a result of the genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronavirus results in more plastic genomic modifications to mutation and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of inter-speed coalization that would be conducive to the emergence of new coronaviruses if conditions existed.
Many unique open reading and protein functions encoded in the direction of the 3-end genome contribute to this.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique matrix selection mechanism, the coronavirus are random and often switch on matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcribation of the DNA of the coronavirus in the wearer, which serves as a mixture receptacle, tinnitus is often switched.
Highly-protected and subgenerated RNAs can recombinate and create new coronavirus.
Both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and coronavirus animals, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 volatile mice, have been detected by the philogenetic evidence of natural recombination.
Interaction of the virus bearer with regard to transmission
In addition to the three above viral factors, the interaction of the virus with the carrier ' s receptacle is another key factor important for inter-visual transmission.
This article sets as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in inter-speed events, a recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-CV strains of human beings and the cive, SARS-CoV is considered to be a rapid adaptation in different media, especially with regard to RSD protein S mutations.
In general, S coronavirus protein is interacting with the cell receptor, and the response of the carrier's antibodies is intensive.
The RSD of SARS-CoV is amino acids, from 318 to 510 on fragment S1, which connects to angiotensing enzyme 2 (APF2) and its correlaters for the introduction of the virus in the cell.
The RSD virus SARS-CV is able to recognize various animal receptors of APF2, including volatile mouses, cives, mouses and еноtoвид dogs, making possible inter-visual transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, which differ from human viral strains and cives, four of which are in the recipe-related motivation for interaction with the APF receptacle.
The SARS-CoV cive has the K479N and S487T mutations in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the hypogenic protein interaction with the human receptor APF2.
In other words, these two substitutes for amino acids can be particularly important for adapting the virus to human beings.
It is worth noting that SARS-CV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30 per cent between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S leads to a change in the affinity of S to APF2 human beings.
Indeed, a Cryoelectron microscope study suggests that the affinity of this link is 10 to 20 times higher than that of APF2 and S virus SARS-CoV.
It would also be interesting to know whether any other roots were required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also linked to APF2 but to another segment of S protein.
There are many other receptors of HCV, such as Aminoptidasis N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acethylyl acid for HCV-OC43.
They can also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to people after inter-speed transfers from animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of interspecies of HCV is also managed by other factors of dependency and limitation on the carrier.
The diversification of these proteins between people and natural HCV reservoirs, such as volatile mice, single-rope camels and rods, can be a barrier to inter-speed transmission.
To ensure successful inter-visual transmission of HCV viruses, it is necessary to harmonize dependency factors and to subordinate driver resurgence.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be produced by an impartial full-genetic screening of the dependency and resurgence factors for SARS-CV-2 through the latest technology of CRISPR.
New HCV: back to zero mark
The varieties of volatile mice coroners provide broad opportunities for the emergence of new HCVs.
In this sense, coronavirus of volatile mice serves as a genetic bullet for HCV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also the driving force of HCV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotipes.
The SARS-CV proteins are considered important for human adaptation, since volatile mice viruses, related to SARS-CoV, have been isolated, but they have been found to be coded by the Dergent Proteins of ORF8.
A 29-nucleotid delegation characterized by SARS-CoV coronators was found in the strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This delegation breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered to be adaptive mutation, which accelerates the replacement of the carriers.
In addition, SARS-CV has a history of possible alpha- and gamma-coronating recycling, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA-polymerage.
The recombination has also been identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CV had been subject to a recombinant between different lines, which occurred in one-rope camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs, where HCV was recombined with other animals in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial sectioning can contribute to unintentional changes in virus genomes, which is likely the result of the release of the virus from the salvage pressures, such as the immune system of the wearer.
An example of such effects is the loss of a full-dimensional ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the two-nucleotid delegation.
While an intricate open reading frame of ORF4 can be seen from the volatile mouse and camel-kind HCV-229E viruses, the alpha-coronavir of the alpaca shows a single-nucleotide insertion, leading to a shift in the framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCV is also due to the selection pressure on their reservoirs.
When infected with volatile mice, cronaviruses recorded weakly expressed symptoms or lack of them, which suggests mutual adaptation between coronavirus and volatile mice.
It turns out that flying mice is anatomically and physiologically well adapted to the coronavirus.
For example, defects in the activation of provocative responses in flying mice effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronavirus.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in volatile mice is suppressed by the apregation of the inhibitor ' s natural killer nKG2/CD94 cells and the low level of exposure of the main hytocompatibility complex of Class I molecules.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which is provided with high metabolic activity of volatile mice, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus while influencing the reading of exoriboneuclea, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of the strains of the virus which, when entering the new medium, are highly patogenic.
The more pathogenic strains of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the medium.
Thus, it is no accident that in the last twenty years, three new coronavirus have emerged.
Coronations are nonpatogenic or cause light symptoms in their reservoirs, such as volatile mice or camels.
They reproduce confidently without causing a strong immune response from the wearer.
That is the secret of why we see unsymptomous carriers, and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Heavy symptoms are mainly linked to hyperactivity of immune response and a cytokin storm, with more immune response, the more severe lung damage.
On the contrary, the immune response of the unsymptomless bearers does not involve the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy for non-communication of immune response may have a favourable effect on therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The volatile mice has a strong interferonial response.
Thus, the acceptance of type I interference, at least at the start of SARS-CV-2 infection, should have a favourable effect.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflamma was disrupted in volatile mice.
As a result, inhibiting NLRP3-inflammas through MCC950 may be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 was followed by a common pattern of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the betacoronavirus of volatile mice, whose nucleotide homology coincides with SARS-CoV, is also a coronavirus of volatile mice, whose nucleotide homology coincides 96% with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that cives and other animals on the market are carrying viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no directly intermediate mediums have been installed for SARS-CV-2.
The beta-coronavirus of the pangolin, astonishingly homologic SARS-CoV-2, indicated that the pangolins could be one of the intermediate carriers or that fragments of the betacoronavirus genes of the pangolins could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
The Crown Viruses have attracted universal attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
A study of the coronavirus in volatile mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zone-based origin and of HCV animals in human transfer.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from flying mice and have been handed over to man through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CV infection occurs from contact between people and cigarettes in markets, the closure of wildlife markets and the destruction of cigarettes on them could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the discovery of a variety of betacoronavirus lines of the pangolins close-born SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed in order to prevent zone-based transmission of infection from products markets.
However, whether SARS-CV-2 is transmitted to people through pangolins and other mammals, and how this can be done remains the task of future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CV virus has long existed in one-rope camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as a major source of meat, milk, skin and wool for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and in Africa.
Therefore, all camels cannot be donated to control MERS, as was done in China ' s wild animal markets to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-COV for camels, combined with other infectious controls.
Since we cannot address these viruses, new genetypes can emerge from outbreaks of disease.
The world is circulating a variety of zonous coronaviruses.
In particular, the coronavirus of volatile mice with zoning potential are extremely varied.
There are many opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zonous coronaviruses, which will in the future lead to the emergence of new coronavirus, which are easier to pass and (or) more deadly to human beings.
To reduce the number of surplus contacts between people and animals, a culture of wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
Following severe tests, which have become SARS, MERS and COVID19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories can be captured.
Although many features of volatile mice are favourable for spreading viruses, by teaching people to stay away from them, the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other species of wild animals can be minimized.
Continuous epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of the coronavirus and their natural carriers, which will be useful to prevent the transfer of coronators from animals to man and future outbreaks of disease.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent virus zonosis is to keep people away from the niches of natural zoo viruses.
SARS-CV-2 still lacks some fragments in the puzzle of zonos.
First, if the volatile mouse passed the ancestral virus to SARS-CV-2 pangolins, it is interesting to see in what circumstances the volatile mice and the pangolins share the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if flying mice plays a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with volatile mouses.
Thirdly, if the true intermediate wearer plays a third mammal, it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including human beings, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals, including domestic animals, can be receptive to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and pilot infections should be carried out.
Whether the flying mouse, pangolin or other mammals are expected to be identified by their natural carriers in the future by SARS-CV-2 or its predecessor viruses.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 to animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria needed to be updated for “suspects of disease” and COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, the group published a brief background manual on diagnosing and treating the new coronavirus infection of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which describes our experiences and makes clear recommendations to combat the pandemic worldwide.
However, cronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of ongoing research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
In that letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and present the latest diagnostic criteria for “subjects to suspicion of disease” and “confirmed cases”, in accordance with the “Dagnostic and therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (seventh version), issued by the National Health Committee of the CDC.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus outbreak occurred 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially known as coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID19), and the virus disease itself was referred to as “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO identified COVID19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief reference manual and published it on the Internet on the website of the Journal of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication attracted great attention.
While we note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased on the basis of current research and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practices have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven editions of the paper “Recommendations on diagnostic and therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Health Committee of the CPD (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), some of its provisions have changed significantly.
Recently, the work prepared by Zhou (Zhou) with sponsors provided comments on our recommendations, containing simple proposals for diagnosis based on existing clinical experience.
This work added new practical evidence to our recommendations, and provided valuable background information on the pandemic that covered the world.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the last edition of the “Diagnostic and therapy Recommendations for COVID-19” (test version seventh) and on current studies, and their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh edition of this document (3 March 2020), a single element of epidemiological history and two clinical manifestations of disease must be merged in order to conduct a comprehensive analysis in the confirmation of suspicion of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in Uhan and its surroundings or in other human settlements where COVID-19 cases were registered within 14 days before symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with SARS-CoV-2 patients with a positive nucleic acid test; (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhang and its surroundings or from other human settlements where COVID-19 has been reported during the last 14 days before symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (mainly 2 cases of high temperature or respiratory symptoms registered for two weeks in small areas, such as house or apartment, office, class in school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external infections of COVID-19; (3) the total number of white cells is normal or reduced with reduced lymphocytes at an early stage.
The diagnosis for the confirmed case of disease should be based on the suspicion of a disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence points, namely: (1) the PCB test in real time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the full-genetic segregation of the virus shows a high homogenicity of the new coronavirus; (3) the serothetic results for IgM-CoV-2 specific IgM antiteles for SARS-CV-2 and IgG; or the change of the result of a test with a negative impact for SARS-CoV-2 antitele IgG, or the increase of titra at least four times in the recovery phase relative to the appropriate speed.
It may also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issue of the document, a real-time PCB test was added for nucleic acids in respiratory or blood samples.
Patogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and in the fifth issue (8 February 2020); then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers who have sought an optimal set to detect nucleic acids in rapid diagnosis, as well as the analysis of samples from respiratory paths, including blood sampling, which increases the availability of different samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive results of tests for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirmation of the disease.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to be cautious in treating patients with atypical symptoms and patients without express symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou) et al. should be updated, as persons without clinical symptoms are classified as “low risk”.
The assessment system also requires clarification of further clinical practices and research.
In conclusion, we look forward to receiving more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspects of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly implement the latest recommendations made in countries where they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner with a view to providing effective assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, a day-to-day maximum
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID19 a day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Research of Diseases (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases were reported, as well as 33 survivors at home.
A total of 17 deaths were registered.
In Briffinga, Director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora, said that four men and one woman were victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two dead were over 60 years of age, two between 51 and 60 years of age, and one at 41 to 50 years of age.
She also reported that the two dead were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic officer informed the local news agency Anadolu that one of the victims was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at the Maitri Clinic of Kuwait.
On Saturday, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obidul Kwader, said that public transport would be terminated for a longer period than originally planned until the next Saturday.
Public transport has been stopped since 26 March and was due to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
Carriage of essential goods — medicines, fuels and foods — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID19 were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March with two returnees from Italy, as well as with a wife of one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people have already been cured.
SARS-CV-2 has overturned the millions of infections worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cases of cronavirus infections in SARS-CV-2 worldwide exceeded 1 million.
COVID-19 killed at least 52,000 people.
Rubeh came on the same day when the first infection had been confirmed in Malawi, and Zambia had registered the first death of the crownavirus.
North Korea argued that, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries that had not reported cases of cronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of contamination, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 for Central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
More than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, with reference to Jones Hopkins University data, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronavirus infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced an increase in measures to prevent the spread of disease.
On Thursday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, prolonged the self-isolation of the citizens of the city until 1 May.
Previously, President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians throughout the country, despite self-resolvedness, would receive salaries up to 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extension of the state of emergency for 15 days; the results were 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and 1 vote in favour.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfews in the sacred towns of Mecca and Medina for a full day, whereas earlier curfews lasted only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand planned to enter a curfew from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The Governor of the State of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the state ' s home isolation regime was extended by order until 1 May.
Cargoes in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at one time
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian Woolworths and Collegiate shops reduced the number of toilet paper packages that could be purchased at one time in all the country stores, to two and one packaging, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a limit on one package.
These limitations were reported in cash advertisements as well as on the Facebook web page.
Citizens were reportedly beginning to make emergency stockpiles because of the fear that COVID19 could lead to a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the number of toilet papers purchased to one package.
Earlier, on 4 and 5 March, respectively, Woolworths and Kong have already limited this number to 4 packages.
The Norwegian Trade Network, in its press release of 8 March, reported that, with the introduction of a limit on four packagings, “the toilet paper is still being purchased too fast — one delivery over an hour”, and called such demand “unprecedented”, while ALDI, published on Tuesday, called this “an unexpected trend”.
According to the representative Woolworths, sales increased sharply last week.
The Costco Magazine in Canberra also limited this number to two packages last week.
In order to fill out the deficit, the Norwegians began to order larger batches of suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI had made reserves for the special share of early sales on the environment.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Rieter Association, reported that the Ritalers were trying to replenish stocks, but this was difficult because the local authorities had restrictions on the travel schedule of trucks.
It looks forward to an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers are trying to meet demand, but fewer profitable proposals are available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, owing to stock depletion, some stores could not hold shares on the environment.
In News.com.au’s report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on retail trade at the University of Queensland technology, said that stores are filled every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a cumbersome product, so the amount of stocks was small and the long rows of toilet were left empty after the distribution of the goods, increasing the sense of stock shortages.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfecting tools could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic,” says Russell Zimmerman.
In the past, the manufacturer of the recycled toilet paper Who gives a Crap reported the end of the stockpile.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the Kleenex and Solaris Paper toilet producer also reported that they were working 24 hours a day to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales site, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to the lack of buyers in the week's Day, some real estate sellers began to offer the first auctioners free toilet paper.
The fourth daily edition of the NT News, published in Darwin, included an eight-page tab designed to cut and use as toilet paper.
According to ABC report of 3 March, first shops were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of items they acquired, stating that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also benefited from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfecting, gallantery, hand washing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to events in Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British supermarket supermarket Ocado also restricted the sale of Andres' toilet paper with two packages of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the communicable disease COVID-19 caused by the Crown Virus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” describes only the extent of the disease rather than the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to:
“All countries together are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are involved in the identification, testing, treatment, isolation of sick persons, the monitoring of the occurrence of the disease and the mobilization of their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisus, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned at both the alarming rate of spread and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction”.
According to Dr. Tom Freden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than the flu has yet to be traced since it emerged to continuous global proliferation”.
Mr. Hebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never observed the pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
We have also never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
At first, in January, WHO declared this disease to be an emergency situation in the field of public health of international importance and then assigned it a new status, the pandemic.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchy, said of the outbreak: “This is only the beginning, it will be worse”.
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID19 have been reported on Thursday, and more than 4,600 have died.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is now a 2019 (COVID19) pandemic of cronavirus syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Ouhan, China, in December 2019, and on 30 January 2020 the emergency of international importance in public health was declared, which was subsequently recognized by the pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID19 were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
China's mortality rate is 4 per cent, while the world ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and difficult breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distributor.
The incidence of symptoms from the first to the peak is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
At present, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The basic treatment is symptomatic and supportive: recommended preventive measures include washing of hands, covering the mouth of coughs, keeping distances between people, detecting and ensuring self-sufficiency of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, job risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has resulted in serious global socio-economic consequences, the transfer or abolition of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, and the widespread lack of goods compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of students worldwide.
Disinformation about the virus has begun on the Internet, cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people resembling them externally, as well as other groups of people living in areas where there have been significant cases of spread of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in the city of Hubei, China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases of contamination were mainly related to the juanan optical market, so the virus is believed to have a zonous origin.
The outbreak virus is known as SARS-CV-2, a recently opened virus that is very similar to that of a flying mouse, pangolin crowners and SARS-CoV. It was subsequently discovered that the first case of the disease had arisen on December 1, 2019, and that the infected person had not visited the market since that date.
Two thirds of the cases reported in December 2019 were related to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in a publication of the South China office of the newspaper “Morning Post”, which was unchecked, it was suggested that the first case of infection had occurred with a 55-year-old resident in Hubei on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new infections in China had declined but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new infections outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new infections in China itself.
The number of cases of illness may be significantly underestimated, in particular as a result of numerous cases of weakly expressed symptoms.
By 26 February, there were relatively few cases of infection among young people, with 19-year-old patients with fewer than 2.4 per cent of all cases worldwide, and the U.S. scientific adviser Patrick Vallans calculated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of people who have been checked at COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to test more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain, an official policy had been adopted requiring that only minor symptoms should not be tested.
A study published on 16 March revealed that 86 per cent of COVID-19 cases were not detected in China until 23 January, and that such unregistered patients became a source of infection for 79 per cent of reported cases.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of actual infections in Italy largely exceeded the number of reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive rate (R0) for COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure can be 5.7.
Most patients from COVID-19 are well-being.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the beginning of the symptoms to the time of death was between 6 and 41 days, the most frequent of which was 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were persons over the age of 60 and 75 per cent of those killed had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, and official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually included information on the deaths of patients with positive results of COVID testing under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take account of dead persons who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Incomplete data for Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID 4-5 times.
The Spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] is below the actual level”. His words are confirmed by reports of some single cases in the United States, which are often reported incomplete in pandemics, such as the pandemic of the pig influenza H1N1 2009; the first confirmed death was recorded in Ukhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was registered on 1 February in the Philippines and outside Asia in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were registered outside mainland China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths; several methods were used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary according to the region and the time of the disease; they also affect the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the outbreak of the disease and the population, such as age, sex and general health; the “death/morbidity” ratio represents the number of deaths distributed to the number of diagnosed infections during the specified interval.
According to Jones Hopkins University statistics, as of 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and contamination cases is 6.0 per cent (97,039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the rate of mortality to morbidity decreased from 17.3 per cent (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who have symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of deaths due to the disease (CFR) of diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of infection mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosed and unidentified) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time of contamination to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific groups of people.
According to estimates by the Centre for Evidence Medicine at the University of Oxford, the overall rate of death from the pandemic is between 0.1 and 0.39 per cent.
The upper digit of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary test on COVID-19 in Germany, as well as the statistical study on the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be monitored.
The peak and the exact duration of the flashing shall not be defined and may be different according to the location.
Matzai Boni, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks usually go to the platoon, and then, when the number of available patients ends, they begin to extinguish.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when this will occur.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Government of China, Jun Nanshang, states that “everything can end by June”, if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate perhaps within a year or two”.
According to a study carried out by the Emperor College led by Nile Ferguson, “until vaccines (probably 18 months or more) are to be established”, physical distance measures and other measures will need to be implemented.
William Shaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, says: “I don’t think that this coronavirus will ever disappear at all because it's so easily transmitted”, and that he “can turn into a seasonal disease by flashing every year.”
The virulentity of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
COVID19 symptoms may be relatively non-special, and some infected people may suffer without symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are high temperatures (88 per cent) and dry coughs (68 per cent).
Fewer common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory wetness (slip), loss of smell, breathing, muscle pain and joint pain, pain in throat, headache, blade, blasphemy, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO argues that it is seriously ill with the development of breathing problems of approximately 1 in 6 people.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists urgent symptoms, such as breathing difficulties, constant pain or breast pressure, sudden sense of spiderity, difficulty of awakening and abnormalization of the person or lips, and, if these symptoms occur, it is necessary to seek immediate medical assistance; further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected people may have an unsymptomous disease, without any clinical manifestation, but the results confirm that they are infected, so doctors recommend that persons in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed to be closely monitored and examined for infection.
Chinese scientists estimate that the number of cases of unsymptomous fluctuations varies from several to 44 per cent of all cases.
The normal incubation period (periods between infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days; it is usually five days; until there is no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of humid, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who have developed this symptom was initially 30 per cent and then down to 15 per cent.
Some details on the spread of the disease are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small droplets released together with cough, chewing or during conversation; close contact in a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, droplets can be spread from 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet) in the open cough.
There are assumptions that the virus may also be transmitted through small drops dumped into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time; respiratory drops may also be generated when breathing, including during conversation, although the virus is not usually carried by air.
The droplets may fall into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as in the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resilience (ASD), can lead to the dispersal of extraction products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It may also penetrate the body if the person relates to the contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching his eyes, nose or mouth.
There are also fears that the virus can be transmitted through feces, but the risk of such transmission is considered low.
The Chinese Government denies the possibility of a feal oral transmission of SARS-CV-2. The virus is the most infected during the first three days of the symptoms, although it can occur both before symptoms occur and at later stages of the disease.
There were cases where tests were positive for testing three days before the symptoms occurred, which indicated the possibility of transmitting the virus before the symptoms were expressed.
There are only a few reports of laboratoryly confirmed cases of unsymptomous flows of disease, but some countries have also identified cases of transmission from unsymptomal carriers.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is commonly infected by 2 to 3 others; the virus is able to survive from hours to days.
In particular, it has been found that the plastic surface (polipropyle) and the stainless steel (304) is capable of living up to three days, on the cardboard surface for one day, and on the copper surfaces up to four hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to people, although the British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as after contact with other surfaces to which infected people could be touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new virus found for the first time in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All the signs of the new SARS-CV-2 virus are found in nature in coronaurus, and the virus can be destroyed inside the human body by a domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CV-2 is much like the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is expected to have a zonous origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with the Betacoronavirus, the Sarbecovirus (cellline B), together with two other strains of volatile mice viruses.
At a holistic and genomical level, it is 96 per cent identical to the other coronavirus of the volatile mouse (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain sequences of pangolin and human virus genomes.
The whole-genomic comparison to date has shown that the largest percentage of similarities (92 per cent) exists between the Pangolin crown and SARS-CoV-2, but that is not enough to prove that the pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
The virus can be diagnosed pre-integrationally on the basis of symptoms, although this should be confirmed in the end by analysis of a polymerotic chain reaction with reverse transcribing (RT-CP) of an infected secret or computer volume.
A study that compared the PCB and CTC methods used in Uhan has shown that the CTC is much more sensitive than the PCB, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and disease flow processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology published the recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first line testing method in COVID-19”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
Real-time polymerial chain response testing (RT-CPD) is carried out.
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and on blood samples.
The results are usually ready for a period of between hours and several days.
Usually a rhino-wheeled basket is used for the test, although zev can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them had proved to be accurate enough to be approved for universal application.
In the United States, the serological test developed by Cellex was approved for use in emergency cases only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of the visualization of symptoms in X-rays and computer scans (CT) are asymmetrical peripheral mussing by type of matinee glass and the absence of pleural decorations.
The Italian radiological society is responsible for the development of an international database of evidenced cases of infection.
Because of similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, the COVID-19 images not confirmed by the CRO tests have a limited clinical specificity.
A major study was carried out in China that compared the results of the CT and PCD testing, and it was clarified that, although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be deciphered faster; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method could be seen as a screening tool in contaminated areas.
X-rays and computer scanners have been developed to detect the virus through artificial intelligence.
Strategies for prevention of transmission include the maintenance of common personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mercury with dirty hands, use of coughing or salphetting, which should be thrown immediately after use.
Those who are already infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people be physically separated, and many Governments recommend that they refrain from any emergency visits to the countries and areas affected by the outbreak and limit the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to spread in most of the regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to the population, some members of which do not know where and how it was contaminated, and medical workers who care for patients who may be infected are encouraged to use standard precautionary measures, as well as precautionary measures in contact with other people and eye protection.
The use by Governments of data on the whereabouts of citizens through their mobile phones for this purpose has raised concerns about confidentiality, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as more than 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring the restriction of this type of monitoring of persons.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked to develop decisions that ensure the confidentiality of personal data, such as the registration of user closeness to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user was in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test was positive, he would receive the relevant notification. There are also unreasonable versions of how to prevent infection, such as stripping his nose and mouth, which is ineffective.
At present, there are no COVID-19 vaccines, although many organizations are working to create it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC (Centre of Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends that hands be washed with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting toilets or heavy hand pollution, and before eating, after weaving, coughing or chewing.
This is necessary because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that uncovers its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, CDC recommends that hand-mane-management devices be used at least 60 per cent.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stained steel, the disinfecting appliance starts to operate a minute after wearing) containing 62 - 71 per cent ethanol, 50 - 100 per cent ispropanol, 0.1 per cent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 per cent hydrogen oxide peroxide and 0.2 - 7.5 per cent zodon iod.
Other components, such as bensalconia chloride and chloroxygen gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of a suspicion of a COVID or its confirmation at an institution such as a office or a daily stationary, all spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, public spaces, electronic equipment such as tablets, sensory screens, keyboards, remote control pulses and bankroms used by sick persons, be subjected to disinfections.
Medical organizations recommend that coughing or sneeze cover the mouth and the nose with the elbow or salphet and remove the hygiene used immediately.
Those who may have been infected are encouraged to use medical masks, since the use of the mask can limit the volume and range of extraction products that are dispersed in the air when talking, chewing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virusologist from the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the inclination of people to their faces, while touching the face with dirty hands is a basic way of infection”. The masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, to those who take care of a person from COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask actually reduces the number of contacts.
Several countries have begun to call for medical masks in public places.
The CDC Centres, U.S., recommend wearing non-medical clothing masks, China has emphasized separately the importance of using one-time medical masks by healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong is encouraged to wear a medical mask in public transport or in human places.
The health officials in Thailand encourage people to make personal cloth masks in their home environment and to erase them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from entering the street without masks closing their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Viet Nam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian Government has committed all visitors to food stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are made every day from mid-March, all passengers in trains and coaches were required to use medical masks.
In Panama, residents are obliged to wear a medical mask on the street; those who cannot acquire masks were advised to sew them on their own in household conditions.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a response to infection to slow down the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, jobs, stadiums, theatres and trade centres.
People can use social distances while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding people's places, using uncontactive greetings and physical distances from others.
Many Governments in the regions, especially those affected by outbreak, are currently ordering or recommending social distances.
The maximum number of people who can meet in one place, as recommended by the U.S. government and health organizations, has been quickly reduced from 250 (in regions where there was no data on the dissemination of COVID-19), to 50 and later to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned groupings with more than two persons, with older persons and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertonia and weakened immune system facing a high risk of severe infection. CDC recommends that they remain at home as long as possible if there is a disease outbreak in the region.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood in such a way that people should be completely socially excluded, rather than being in contact with others in alternative ways, some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations were made for sexual relations only with your permanent partners with whom you are living and who are confident that it lacks the virus and its symptoms.
COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected have been diagnosed with self-insulated in household conditions.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-isolation, and many Governments have also imposed mandatory measures or have recommended that the entire population of the affected areas be placed on quarantine.
A heavy quarantine was prescribed for persons in high-risk groups.
Persons who may have been contacted by COVID-19 or who have recently visited a country or region affected by the epidemic were encouraged to find quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat outbreak include deterrence, suppression or mitigation of the disease.
The control of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as implies other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
At a time when the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are directed towards mitigation: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on health and society.
Measures to control and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease may be taken simultaneously.
Infectious infections require more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the base number of infections to below 1. The part of the efforts to control the outbreak of the infection is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overcrowding in health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hygiene of hands, use of medical masks and self-resolvedness; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the abolition of mass activities; the community ' s involvement in such measures; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning; and after the seriousness of the outbreak has become apparent in China, more decisive actions have been taken to curb the outbreak, such as the isolation of whole cities and the imposition of severe travel bans.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, massive screening and localized quarantines have been introduced, as well as a system for warning the movements of infected persons.
In Singapore, it provided financial support to infected persons who were self-resolved and imposed large fines on those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks increased and fined the accumulation of surplus medications. U.S. and U.S. modelling showed that there are serious problems with regard to mitigation (reducing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (restraining the epidemic).
The optimal policy of mitigating the effects of the spread of disease can reduce the peak pressure on the health system by 2/3, while mortality can double, but lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapsing of health systems.
It may be preferable, but it must be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it occurs earlier), since otherwise the spread of the disease will be renewed rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
There are no anti-virusive drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Admission of nonrecharge medicines from colds, drinking enough liquids, and recreation can help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the gravity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous induction of liquid and support for breathing.
The use of steroids can only harm.
Several connections previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are also considered for treatment by COVID19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic” tools could facilitate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and the adaptation of health to the needs of patients from COVID-19 as the main response to the outbreak of the disease.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office of Europe issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to facilitate the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for testing at COVID-19, the lifting of urgent procedures wherever possible, the detection of virus and the isolation of patients with confirmed diagnosis COVID19, as well as the enhancement of capacity for intensified therapy by training staff and increasing the number of available IML and coecs.
There are various theories about where the first infection could have occurred, the so-called "no-alone patient".
The first known case of contamination of the new coronavirus infection was likely to take place on 1 December 2019 in the city of Hubei Province, China.
The number of cronavirus infections in Hubei Province has gradually increased during the month.
They were mainly related to the Optical Market of the Juanan Sea, where living animals were also sold, and one theory was that the virus had penetrated from one of these animals; in other words, the virus had a zonosis origin. On 26 December, a massive pneumonia disease of unknown origin was registered in the Hubei Clinic, with which the doctor Zang Tianjin, who reported on 27 December to the Centre for the Control and Prevention of Tsianhan Illness in the city of Uhaan.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at the Uhan Central Clinic warned their colleagues of “the coronavirus similar to the SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wennjan, were warned by the police that they were responsible for distributing false rumors, and Ai Fan, a doctor, received a plea from her supervisors for raising panic.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission, Huhana, issued a public notification and informed WHO of the situation.
The health authorities of Huhaniah reported on the number of unknown pneumonia, which proved to be large enough to initiate investigations in early January, doubled the number of cases every seven and a half days at the early stages of the outbreak.
At the beginning and mid-January of 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, which were facilitated by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Uhan was a transport and main rail hub.
On 20 January, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to the later official data, by 20 January 2020, the symptoms of the disease had already occurred in 6,174 persons; as of 26 March, the United States had beaten China and Italy to the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 were killed, and more than 364,000 were recovered.
Approximately 200 countries and territories recorded at least one reported case.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries of the Schengen Zone have restricted their freedom of movement and have established border controls.
National responses included measures to curb the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory housekeeping, compulsory shelter or isolation), and curfews. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population of the United States, were in any form of carantine, over 50 million people were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of isolation, and two days later the figure increased to 2.6 billion — about one third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Uhan on 1 December 2019; according to another report, whose validity was not verified, the date was 17 November.
On 26 December, a doctor, Zhang Ji Xiyang, worked with an unknown type of pneumonia in the case of a mass disease, and on 27 December her clinic informed the Centre for Control and Prevention of Tsiang disease in the city of Ouhan.
The first genetic test of the patients, which took place on 27 December 2019, showed the existence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Huhania issued a public notification.
WHO was notified on the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Ouhan to be responsible for “disseminating hearings” about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission asserted that there was no “experience” of the ability of the newly discovered virus to be transferred from person to human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to curb the spread of the virus, later referred to as the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China, Si Jingpin, as “the national war”.
The events of “the largest large-scale carantine in human history” began to occur, on 23 January, the sanitary border and the ban on entry in Uhuhan later spread to a total of 15 towns in Hubei province and reached a total of about 57 million people.
Personal transport was prohibited in the city.
In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (25 January) were abolished.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary Hospital of Huoshenshan, which had been completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, Leishenshan, was constructed, which received other patients coming.
In addition to the newly constructed hospitals, China has also reprofiled 14 other institutions in Huhan, such as conference centres and stadiums, to temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government has taken additional measures to curb the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health certificates for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year.
Universitys and schools were closed throughout the country.
Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote working regime.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and outside the province of Hubei.
The public transport schedule was modified and the museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, citizens ' movements were monitored and estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) had faced a form of open air traffic restrictions, and since the outbreak entered the global phase in March, Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city, and as of 23 March, only one intra-country infection was reported in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from the person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Lee Ketzan of China reported that the incidence of internally transmitted diseases was largely stopped and the outbreak in China was monitored.
On the same day, the travel restrictions to Hubei other than Huhana were withdrawn, which took place two months after the closure of the province to quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that, since 28 March, the entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended.
Those wishing to come to China would have to apply for a visa in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government called on enterprises and factories to resume their work and provided companies with cash incentive packages. On 4 April, a three-minute national “minute silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning on the victims of the coronavirus, declared by the State Council of the country and coincided with the holiday of Quinmini, but the central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the dead online in order to avoid the re-emergence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID19 had extended to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases, largely due to the large number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji.
The Shinchhongi followers arrived in Tegu from Uhania, which is allegedly a source of outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported having symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, South Korea received the highest level of alarm.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and on 29 February this figure has increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were placed on quarantine after, according to the analysis, the virus had been confirmed by three soldiers.
The flash has affected the number of travels, so the schedule of airline flights has been changed, and South Korea has launched a population screening programme on the existence of a virus, tracking contacts and organizing quarantine measures for contactors, which is considered to be the largest and best in terms of its organization around the world.
The screening techniques included mandatory reporting of their symptoms through mobile apps to all offshore visitors, primary testing for the virus, which was ready for the next day, as well as increased testing capacity, which allowed to test up to 20,000 people on a daily basis.
South Korea ' s programme was considered successful in the fight against the outbreak of disease, despite the fact that entire cities had not been isolated, and the South Korean society had initially been divided by the response of President Mun Zhae In to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the actions of the President or encouraged Mr. Moon to impress Mr. Moon for the inappropriate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.

The United Kingdom responded to the virus as peacefully as possible from all affected countries and, by 18 March 2020, the British Government had not obliged citizens to observe any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for the insufficient and serious response to the danger of the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending that all visits and social contacts that were not of paramount importance be refrained from, and that people be invited to work from home and avoid public places such as pabs, restaurants and theatres wherever possible.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment institutions, such as pabs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible and promised working citizens to pay up to 80 per cent of their wages, but not more than £2,500 per month as a measure of support to the population during the crisis.

On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on transportation in Uhan, representative of WHO, Yojen Galea, noted that although “this measure was clearly not recommended by WHO”, it was also “very important to confirm the implementation of the obligation to contain the epidemic in the place of greatest proliferation” and called it “unprecedented in the history of public health”. On 30 January, after the possibility of human transmission to people outside China and the increase in the number of infected countries in other countries had been confirmed, WHO had declared an emergency in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation had become the sixth since 2009, when the pig influenza pandemic had been applied for the first time.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Aden, said that the PHEIC announcement was “due to global proliferation, especially in low- and middle-income countries with unreliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr. Tedros stated that “there is no reason for measures that are excessively impediments to international movements and trade” and that “WHO recommends no restriction on trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting the need for urgent assistance to countries that “do not have systems to identify people affected by the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached those countries”.
Mr. Tedros also stated that “the indicator of our readiness is a degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link” and called on the international community to make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. The press conference held on 11 February established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire United Nations system in response to the problem”.
As a result, the United Nations Crisis Management Group has been established to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, according to WHO, will “focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their experience to combat the outbreak of disease in a broader social and economic manner”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which provided the work of international experts and field staff of WHO in China to assist in resolving the internal situation and assessing the “severity of disease and its contagion”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of the response at the provincial and district levels, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “peace should do more to prepare for the possible coronavirus pandemic, noting that “the disease must be called pandemic too early, but the countries must be prepared”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the probability of global circulation of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” — the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is the verification of every government on the planet to be prepared for a real situation: it is time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready,” and stressed that the right response can help the world to avoid “the worst scenario of events”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not provide a basis for announcing the global pandemic as public health officials, and added that the pandemic announcement would mean that “we are essentially recognizing the fact that every person in the world would be at risk of being infected with the virus”.
On March 11, WHO declared the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inaction on the problem”. WHO is seriously criticized for the perceived inadequate approach to the concept of the pandemic, including the later declaration of the public health emergency and the classification of the virus as pandemics.
As a response to the current situation, Mr. Tedros Adenama, Director-General of WHO, was requested to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respect for the rights of everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to apply life-saving measures to it and that the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with disabilities, members of minority groups, older citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other inaccurate groups in need of State support.
International governmental organizations address the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide timely and comprehensive information on responses to policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to provide views and recommendations.
The Digital Unit provides information on policy measures by different countries (Country Policy Tracker) to strengthen health and the world economy, address the effects of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronavirus.
The Government of China has been criticized by the United States, the British Cabinet of Michael Gov and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of the President of Brazil, Jaira Bolsonar, for the actions taken to combat the pandemic, which began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of the leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have been dismissed for the quarantines they have taken in central China, and these dismissals have been evidenced by the resentment by the response of the political exploding in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China C. Jinpin from public anger over the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Litzyang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the coronavirus had begun in Uhan, but accepted the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had arisen in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. Presidential Administration Donald Trumpa called the Crown Virus of China or the “Virus of Huhanya”, stating that “Censura in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement has in turn been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “due from the inability of the U.S. president's administration to curb the spread of disease”.
The Daily Beast has gained access to a U.S. government telegram containing a communication strategic craft, apparently invented by the National Security Council, with reference to the strategy: “The whole business is in China.
We are asked to distribute this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television presentations.” Such organizations as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China ' s efforts to assist the virus-affected countries are part of the propaganda campaign to gain global influence.
The head of the EU foreign policy department, Josep Borrell, warned of the presence of “the geopolitical component that includes the fight for influence through the piar and the so-called generosity policy”.
Borrill also stated that “China is steadily advocating the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called on the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information on sending assistance to the last two countries.
The donation by Jack Ma 100,000 medical masks to Cuba was banned in connection with the U.S. sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused of redirecting assistance for other countries to their own country.
Other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, Czech Republic and Italy, also had disputes with regard to medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has deployed hundreds of IWL equipment for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus of Italy.
Mauricio Massari, Ambassador of Italy to the EU, said that “China only reacted bilaterally.
This clearly does not indicate European solidarity.”
On 22 March, after telephone conversation with Prime Minister Giuseppe Konte of Italy, President of Russia Vladimir Putin organized the sending to Italy of Russian military sanitation, specialized disinfecting transport and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “unusable or not useful to Italy”.
The source accused Russia of striving to give a favourable impression to the world public at the “geopolitan and diplomatic level”.
The President of Lombardia Attilo Fontan and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Spokesman for Creml Dmitry Peskov stated that “in proposing assistance to American colleagues [Putin] implied that, when American producers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they would also be able to respond as needed.”
The NATO Defence 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries — the largest military exercises of NATO since the end of the cold war — will be conducted in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Keith Hadson, criticized Defender 2020 (Protection 2020): “In the crisis today in public health, these teachings threaten not only the lives of the United States and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Iranian Government suffered severely from the virus. There are about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as 15 other current or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani, Iran, in an open letter, appealed to world leaders for assistance, stating that his country was in a difficult position to combat the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in connection with the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt social policies that were common in other wealthy countries, including the introduction of a single system of health care and care for children, paid family leave and increased public health financing.
Politicians expected that this could have a negative effect on the chances of Donald Tramp to re-election in the 2020 presidential elections, and the pandemic had worsened diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan's “unambiguous and passive quarantine measures” after Japan announced that any citizen coming from South Korea would be placed on a two-week quarantine in designated places by the Government.
The South Korean society was originally divided by the reaction of President Mun Zhein to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the actions of the President or called on Mr. Moon to impress Mr. Moon for the inappropriate response of the Government to the outbreak of the disease.
Some commentators expressed concern that this step would enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in favour of granting Prime Minister Victor Orban an indefinite right to administer through decrees, suspend the work of Parliament, as well as to hold elections and punish those accused of disseminating fierce information on the virus and government responses to the crisis.
The outbreak of the coronavirus was described as a result of several supply deficits due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and disruption of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration for Food and Medicine Quality Control issued a warning of the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased demand and malfunctions in suppliers.
In several settlements, panic purchases have also occurred; this has led to a situation where first-needed goods, such as food, toilet paper and betained water, have disappeared from shops, which has in turn led to a deficit of stockpiles.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to Mr. Tedros Adenam, Director-General of WHO, the demand for individual protection has increased 100 times.
This jump resulted in a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the normal price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical supplies by four to six months.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection worldwide, and WHO warned that health workers would therefore be hit.
In Australia, in connection with the Daigo pandemic, buyers were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
These activities have led to a lack of child nutrition in some supermarkets and have subsequently been banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in Northern Italy and the Uhahan region, as well as the high demand for food, food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and the illicit trade in critical products that have been successful have avoided the severe food shortages expected in Europe and in North America.
North Italy, with small-scale agricultural production, did not experience significant downturn, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices could increase.
The shelves of food stores were left empty only temporarily, even in the city of Ouhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pig stocks to ensure full food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require food producers to maintain food supplies in emergency situations.
China was affected by the damage caused by the world economy: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy suffered severe damage in the first two months of 2020, as a result of measures taken by the Government to combat the spread of the virus, which reduced its retail sales by 20.5 per cent.
Material China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, viral outbreak is considered to be a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agate Demarai, an Economist Intelligence Unit, forecasts that market volatility will remain until a clearer understanding of potential results is made.
In January 2020, some analysts calculated that the economic consequences of the current epidemic in terms of global growth might exceed the consequences of the 2002-2004 apology pneumonia.
According to an assessment made by an expert from the University of Washington in St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and negative effects could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has begun to take urgent measures after a sharp decline in oil prices due to the fall in demand by China.
On 24 February, global stock markets collapsed as the number of people infected by COVID-19 has increased significantly beyond mainland China.
On 27 February, due to the growing fears of the outbreak of the coronavirus, the various US stock indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow-Jones index for shares of industrial companies, have shown the most dramatic decline since 2008, with the Dow index falling by 1191 points, the largest one-day fall after the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed a more than 10 per cent drop.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China ' s sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative forecast.
The shares again fell due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a risk of economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than in the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors in connection with the bans on movement, the closure of public places, including tourist sites, and the recommendations of Governments not to make any visits.
As a result of all these measures, many airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for airlines, including British Airways, China East Airlines and Qantas, and Flybe's British Regional Airlines ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has been stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-June, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year ' s celebrations.
A number of activities involving large numbers of people have been abolished by national and regional Governments, including annual New Year festivals; private companies have also self-sustained their shops and tourist attractions, such as the Hong Kong and the Shanghai Disneylands.
Many new-year events had been cancelled and tourist attractions had been closed to prevent mass accumulations; for example, a barred town had been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs had been abolished.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year ' s holidays until 10 February, ordering the majority of enterprises not to open up until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country ' s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and have declared an emergency by closing schools until March and canceling the New Year ' s Retails Branch, which has suffered globally: the shop hours have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
Retailing points in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40 per cent.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result, in March the number of shopping centres declined by 33 to 43 per cent compared with February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, installation of visitor temperature checks and cancellation equipment, and an assessment of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave 14 to 22 million more people below the poverty limit than would be in a similar situation, but without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, in the midst of the Ouhan epidemic, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers were home in their provinces or locked in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Luis, in the United States, the coronavirus outbreak may deprive the workplace of 47 million people, while unemployment can reach 32 per cent. Tens of millions of Indian migrant workers who receive daily wages are left unemployed. The study carried out by the Anguus Reid Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had suffered unemployment in one way or another. Almost 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost jobs since the introduction of strict isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment allowance, while 1 million British workers sought a single social payment. Almost half a million companies in Germany had transferred their staff to a subsidized government reduced working schedule of part-time jobs.
The German wage scheme for part-time work was also introduced in France and Britain.
Arts and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic that has affected the activities of organizations and individuals, whether officially employed or independent, throughout the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have tried to support their (often-funded State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for the society, ensuring the safety of their staff and the public, as well as, where possible, support the people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed throughout the world for an indefinite period, or access to them had been limited in various ways and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, extensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, another recent and revolutionary impact of the spread of the virus — the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion displays.
The cinema also crashed, and the Vatican announced the abolition of the Storm Week in Rome, which took place during the last week of the Christian repentant period, the Great Post.
Many eparchies recommend that older Christians stay home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, direct air, or television, while some church leaders are offering open - air service.
The Roman Catholic Evangelizer of Rome closed its churches, chapels and the St. Peter’s area, where there are no more Christian pilgrims, and later other religious organizations have also cancelled the service and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and rubbers.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the abolition of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of coronavirus and the sanctuaries were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and its own inhabitants to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has resulted in the most significant changes in the calendar of world sports events since the Second World War.
Most of the major sports events have been cancelled or transferred, including the League of the 2019-20 UEFA Championships, the 2019-20 Premier League, the EUFA Euro-2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak of the Crown Virus also destroyed the plans for the 2020 Olympic Flying Games to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted for the period after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021”. Kazino and other game institutions around the world were closed and the poker tournaments, which were usually broadcast in direct air, were also moved or cancelled.
This has led many players to move online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers.
Many major theaters, such as the Broadways, also canceled all their spectacles.
As an alternative to traditional offline activities, some artists and musicians have studied options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing direct broadcasts of online conferences or web festivals; this helps people with creative professions to continue to perform, release or publish their works.
There was a lot of Internet memorial on the subject of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and alleviate the disturbing sentiments characterized by periods of uncertainty.
Since COVID19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism against China's citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as to the hotlines of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Fear, suspicion and hostility have occurred in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific.
In February (when most cases were still limited to China) racist attitudes were recorded in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or had received fair retaliation for anything.
In some African countries, anti-China attitudes have also increased.
Many residents of Hubei and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China ' s citizens, as well as those living in affected areas, were supported both in offline and online modes.
The epidemic had begun to spread in new countries, in particular Italy, the first country in Europe to face the serious outbreak of COVID-19; in that regard, citizens of such regions could also begin to feel suspicious and xenophobia; citizens of such countries as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea had signed a petition at an early stage, insisting on the prohibition of China ' s entry into their countries to curb the epidemic.
In Japan, the Hishtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan (#China's Non-ComeVision) held leading positions in Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
The U.S. President Donald Trump faced criticism for what he called the coronavirus “the Chinese virus”; critics consider this view to be racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukhan evacuated Ukrainian and foreign nationals in New Sanjara.
Students coming from China's north-eastern India border and training in major towns in India reported cases of coronavirus outbreak persecution.
Dilip Ghosh, President of the State Unit of Bharatia Janata, Western Bengal, stated that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “there God had revengeed them”.
These statements were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them “extreme”; in China, xenophobia and racism were once again erupted against non-China citizens: foreigners were called “foreign debris” and “outylization”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have eliminated such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made open access to their scientific articles on the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Some scientists have decided to provide short-term access to the results of their studies on the Prepritenti publications, such as bioRxiv.

Smuggling of wild animals and animal-borne diseases is a health risk associated with trafficking in exotic animals.
Laboratory respiratory testing of 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CV-2 virus includes methods detecting the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by PAC-CP, which recognizes the Crown RNA.
This test is specific and only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus from RNA.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) may be used for both diagnosis and popular control.
Antibodies analysis reveals the number of people who have suffered a disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to treat them in the hospital or have not been available at all.
The exact level of death from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by such a test.
As of March 2020, due to the limited testing capacity, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests conducted in different countries was very controversial.
Such discrepancies are likely to have a significant impact on reported mortality rates, which may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
By means of a polymerotic chain reaction of reverse transcribing in real time (rRT-PCR) the test may be carried out on respiratory samples obtained in various ways, including rhino mascot or mocrot sample.
The results are usually available for a period of between hours and 2 days.
The PPP test, carried out on strokes taken from the throat, is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, but it can continue to reproduce in the lungs.
Infected patients tested during the second week of the disease may be alternatively taken from lower respiratory pathways by means of a draining cateter, or can be used as an alternative to leakage products (mocrota).
One of the early PCB tests was developed in the Charite clinic, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymerosis chain reaction with reverse transcribing in real time (rRT-PCR) and was based on 250,000 kits that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, Kogenebiotech had developed a set for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the Clinical level of PCD (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It identifies the “E” gene, common to all beta-coronavers, and the RdRp gene, special to SARS-CoV-2. The China BGI Group has become one of the first companies that have received permission from China ' s National Drug Administration to use the SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic toolkit on the basis of PCD. In the United States, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing its diagnostic panel to the International Reagent Resource in public health laboratories (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel in public health laboratories.
One of the three genetic tests in the older test sets produced incomplete results due to the renovated reactors and the narrow CDC testing area in Atlanta; as a result, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed during February 2020.
Two component tests were not considered to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Medicine Quality Supervisory Office in the context of the emergency application permit, and the United States commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 on the basis of RT-CPs throughout the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started a COVID-19 test throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were stated; the fence and processing of analyses should be met in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Center for Research in Virusology and Biotechnology, WECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Oversight Service, reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics was approved by FDA to use a test that could take place for 3.5 hours on a large sample, allowing one car to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an urgent authorization to the Abbott laboratories for the Abbott m2000 tests; FDA had previously issued such permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives the EUA from FDA for a 45-minute test.
FDA also approved a test using insulated nucleic acids instead of PCBs.
Since the test does not require a series of rearrange temperature cycles, it can detect positive results in only five minutes and negative in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests a day, and a test is currently being developed in Taiwan using a monolonal antitelele, which is specifically linked to the nucleocapsid protein (N-white) of the new coronavirus, and hopes to get results in 15-20 minutes, like the influenza express test.
The March 2020 review of specialized literature concludes that “frankly diagnostic qualifications are small, whereas [computer volume] results may be of such value even before symptoms occur.”
The typical features identified in the CT include bilateral sub-plebral focuses of mat glass type with peripheral, asymmetrical and apossterior distribution.
Sub-pleural dominance, the symptom of the bulk bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
A study that compared the PCB and CTC methods used in Huhan at the time of the current pandemic has shown that the CTC is much more sensitive than the CRO, although less specific, since many of its visualization functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology published the recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first line testing method in COVID-19”. As of March 2020, CDC's original screening recommends that the CRO method be used.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the development of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in people after the 7th day of the presence of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control.
In many clinical laboratories, these analyses will be able to carry out high-productive automated systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of each such system.
CLT usually uses one peripheral blood sample, although serial samples may also be used to track immune responses.
With the PoCT, one sample of blood is usually obtained by a leak of each cover.
Unlike the methods of PCBs, the blood-blooding phase is not required to be tested. On 26 March 2020, FDA identified 29 organizations that have passed all necessary registration procedures and are now able to distribute their tests to antibodies.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA approved only one emergency permit test. Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were granted European permits to use their test sets, which can detect antibodies IgG and IgA in blood samples capable of fighting the virus.
The test performance is several hundred samples over a few hours and, consequently, the method is much faster than the normal PCB-analysis of the virus RNA.
At the beginning of April, Britain found that none of the antibodies it acquired for analysis on antibodies had produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed to allow patients with suspicion of the virus to stay at home: “Special Aid Officers transmit to the patient the sample, the patient spits in it, gives back and receives the results of the test. British NHS announced the start of its pilot test scheme for suspicious cases in the home environment that eliminates the risk of infection by other visitors to the clinic, or the need to disinfect an ambulance machine if it was used to carry a patient. During the test at COVID-19 suspicious cases, the medical worker is taking an analysis using all appropriate precautionary measures.
The Centres for Express Tests have helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and broadest test procedures in any other country. On 2 March, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany stated that it was ready to conduct some 12,000 tests on a day-to-day basis, and only 10,700 tests per week earlier.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to President Robert Koch of the Institute, Germany's overall test productivity is 160,000 per week.
As of 19 March, a number of major cities were proposed to be expressed.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests issued in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the 12/2020 calendar week, SARS-CoV-2 had a total of at least 483,295 analyses, up to week 12/2020, including 33,491 samples (6.9 per cent), and that the Israeli clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital had developed and tested the simultaneous testing of samples taken from 64 patients, combining samples and conducting further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. On 5 February 2020, BGI was opened by a temporary BGI space lab of 2,000 square metres for the detection of emergency cases, known as Huo-Jun (by Chinese tour or “Fighted”), which could handle more than 10,000 samples per day.
Construction of the laboratory was organized by founder of BGI Van Jianh and completed in only five days; modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been operational at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47 per cent higher, and therefore the cost of quarantine would also be double.
At the opening of the Ouhan Laboratory, Huo-Jang laboratories were immediately opened in Shenchen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the daily total capacity indicators were 50,000 tests per day, and open multiplier schemes of Origami Assays were released, which could test up to 1,122 patients ' tests on COVID19 using only 93 samples, and such balanced designs could work in small laboratories, excluding the need for robust liquid manipulators.
By March, owing to lack of reagents and lack of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States has become problematic.
As a result, some authors referred to the test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the level of testing for the coronavirus, which the United Arab Emirates currently conducts per capita, was higher than that of any other country and would soon be protested by the majority of the population.
This was due to the capacity of the Group of 42 and BGI to obtain a mass testing laboratory (based on their Juo-Jang emergency laboratories in China).
The Laboratory, deployed in 14 days, is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-CP tests a day and is the world's first laboratory of such large scales working outside China.
Various testing options aimed at different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by United States epidemiological hygienic centres was not available until 28 January, resulting in the absence of test kits in the United States; at the outbreak in China and the United States there were problems with the reliability of test kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient quantities recommended by health experts.
In South Korea, experts argue that the wide availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Over the years, the South Korean Government has worked to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as a better way to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of increased demand for testing due to the rapid spread of the virus, many U.S. private laboratories that received hundreds of thousands of samples were overloaded and stockpiles of mascot and chemical reactors were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American CDC test kits had “deficiencies” and for that reason the Government had removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain had acquired test sets from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these sets were inaccurate.
The Firm explained that inaccurate results could be the failure to collect samples or the misuse of sets.
The Ministry of Spain stated that it would replicate inaccurate data sets and replace them with other sets, Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 per cent of the test sets that Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. 1.2 million test sets acquired by Slovakia in China were also considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed to drop them in the Danube. Atesch Kara, a Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the test kits acquired in China had a “high level of errors” and the Ministry “was not using them”. Britain purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it had announced the inappropriateness of these sets for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses have yielded positive results in SARS-CoV-2, as well as the monitoring of the people with whom such patients have been contacted, have had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Wo, where a person died from COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two test cycles of the entire population of about 3,400, with an interval of about ten days.
Approximately half of those with positive results did not have symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were placed in quarantine.
The entry into the settlement area was closed, and this measure has completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic leaked far less tense in Singapore than in other developed countries and did not have to impose such extreme restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many events were cancelled there, and on 28 March Singapore began urging residents to stay at home, but schools ending on 23 March opened by schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also dealt with the pandemic through intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but their restrictions have been less aggressive.
Statistics have shown that in countries where more tests have been conducted compared to death rates, mortality rates are likely to be much lower because more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms have been detected.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID19, send their first five positive and the first ten negative results to COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for supporting testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
On the next graph, the `positive results' column is dependent on the country-specific testing policy.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher rate of positive results than the country where all citizens are tested, irrespective of the symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as “hygiene of hands”, is the process of purifying hands to eliminate pollution, fat, microorganisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted in a fecal oral way.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example, if he touches eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. to slippery shells) by his hands.
Five critical moments during the day followed by washing hands with soap: before and after defecation, after pumping the child's belly or change of tube, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing crude meat, fish and domestic birds.
If water and soap are inaccessible, the hands can be cleaned with the help of the gold. The World Health Organization recommends that the hands be washed:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the care of a sick person.
After the change of diapers or the smashing of the child who went to the toilet.
After shrinking, coughing, or shaking.
After touching animals, feeds or wastes of animal origin.
The medical hygiene of the hands relates to hygiene related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medicines or medical procedures would prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical objective of hand was to clean up the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing disease) and of chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Hand washing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
and reduces the infant mortality rate in households.
A 2013 study showed that better hand washing could result in a small increase in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminders on the benefits of hand washing can reduce the number of diarrhoea cases by about a third, comparable to those of low-income clean water regions.
The reduction of diarrhoea by 48 per cent may be due to washing hands with soap, and washing of hands with soap is the only most effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ODS), with appropriate habits in each house, in schools and in other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the main cause of under-five mortality, which kills about 1.8 million children a year.
Almost 3.5 million children die each year from diarrhea and pneumonia.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before the food and after the toilet, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea mortality by almost twice, and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities under water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, a disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
The small negative effect of frequent hands washing is that it can cause skin drying and, in consequence, damage.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that too frequent hand washing can lead to zuda and skin rod — a disease known as extremity or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common to health workers.
Too often, hand washing may also be considered a symptom of overworking and compulsive disorder (RBM).
There are five so-called critical moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of facal oral transmission of the disease: after emptiness (motion, defecation), after pneumonia of the child (smashing), before feeding the child, before eating, and before/after cooking or processing crude meat, fish or bird.
Some other cases where hands should be washed to prevent the transmission of the disease: before or after the processing of cuts or wounds, after chewing, coughing or shrinking, after adversity to animal wastes or to animals, after garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is quite limited.
A study of hands washing conducted in 54 countries in 2015 showed that, on average, 38.7 per cent of the families were washing hands with soap, and the 2014 study showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was nearer to the middle, 77 per cent of them; the lowest was recorded in China, 23 per cent; there were now several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing a habit of washing hands with soap in critical situations.
The Emergency Health Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to improve child health and education.
This national programme is based on dehelminticization, which is conducted twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily cleaning of fluorescent teeth.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from every cover is more effective if soap or washing is added in the process.
The main operation of soap and cleaning tools is to remove barriers to solventity and to improve its level.
Water in itself is not considered an effective means of purifying the skin, since fats and proteins, which are organic contamination components, are poorly dissolved in the water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
Solid soap can also contain bacteria that can be hit by previous use because of reusable use.
A small number of studies on bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap on each cover indicate a small probability of such falling, as bacteria are washed off with the foam.
CPC still claims that “a liquid soap with manual dosage is the preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively advertised in communities that care for their health.
To date, there is no evidence of the fact that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfecting tools has a selective effect on organisms that are resilient to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains prevalent antibacterial agents, such as triklosane, to which resistant strains of organisms are steady.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to anti-bacterial soap, their effectiveness may not be advertising.
In addition to surface-active substance and leather protection, complex compounds can contain acids (exusive, assorbinous, dairy) as a pN controller, as well as antimicrobial active benzoid acid and other forms of assassination (silent faith, vitamins, mentoles, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis conducted by the Oregon University Public Health School showed that the prevention and removal of bacteria from the skin of the hands, the simple varieties of soap are as effective as the usual antibacterial soap containing triklozan.
The hot water of the human skin is still not hot enough to kill the bacteria.
The bacteria are multiplied much faster at 37 °C.
However, warm soap water is more effective to remove natural fats that contain contamination and bacteria than cold.
Contrary to the popular view, research has shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of the microbial load on the hands.
An antiseptic for hands (sanitaiser) or hand septic is a hygiene for hands that do not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early in the 21st century, alcoholic hand hygiene was gained popularity (also known as hand-defensives, anti-septics for hand-disinfection or sunits).
Most of these means are made on the basis of oropy alcohol or ethanol, which adds nutrients such as carbonmer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of helm, or wetlands such as lizerine in liquid or ink, providing convenience for the use of these tools and reducing the effects of alcohol drying.
The addition of a diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the anti-microbial activity, and the dehydration of at least 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroys microbes.
Bacteria, including multiple medicinal resilience (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and mushrooms, are killed by dehydrates.
The disinfecting agents containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (a reduction logarithm of 3.5 similar to 35 decibels) on their hands 30 seconds after use and 99.99% to 99.999% (a 4-5) reduction logarithm of bacteria in their hands, one minute after the use. Hand dezynic means are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectant drugs are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of communicable gastroentery. A sufficient amount of anti-septic or alcohol-containing equipment must be used to process and soak the skin on both sides.
The face and rear surface of both hands, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the entire length, are grown for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are fully absorbed.
The ends of the fingers on both hands should also be carefully washed, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that the hand washing rather than the use of disinfecting tools, especially if the hands were severely contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfecting tools is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing if water and soap were available.
Often the use of hand dysyncs on a alcoholic basis may cause the dryness of the skin if its composition does not contain softening tools and (or) skin wetlands.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and (or) other softening substances to the substance.
In clinical tests, hand-disinfecting devices containing softening components caused much less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobial washing.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact leakage syndrome or hypervisability to alcohol or supplements present in disinfecting drugs are virtually not occurring.
The lower likelihood of an irritating contact dermitis has become a factor in the choice of disinfecting funds than soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, water-free equipment does not purge the hands of organic substances but simply disinfects them.
It is for this reason that hand-disinfecting tools are not so effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms, such as usual soap and water, as pathogenic microorganisms are still in their hands when using them.
Effectiveness of a hand-free hand, depends largely on components and composition, and has historically been much lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing equipment.
Most recently, it has been proven that drugs using benzalconia chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity, unlike alcohol, which has been proven to be ineffective after multiple use, probably because of progressive side reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with gold or clay.
Zola or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or clay are contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of disease.
Like soap, the ceiling is a disinfecting tool, as in contact with the water, it produces an alkaline solution.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends the use of gold or sand as an alternative.
To prevent contamination, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend the use of hand washing techniques, which include the following stages:
Put your hands down under warm or cold protein water.
It is recommended that the waters be flown because the waters standing can be contaminated and that the temperature of the water does not matter.
Wash your hands with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands and areas between your fingers and your fingers.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows that with soap (and not just one water) people tend to wash their hands more carefully.
Hold your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Treasury helps remove microbes from the skin, and the longer you shake hands, the more microbes are removed.
Carefully fill your hands under protein water.
Hand overlapping in standing water can cause recontamination.
Clean your hands with a clean towel, or let them dry themselves.
Wet and wet hands are more contaminated, and most often people are neglected by areas such as thumb, wrist, areas between fingers and fingers.
The artificial nails and the lacunae for the nails can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended that a humid mosquito be used to prevent the drying of the skin of the hands that can cause damage to the skin and increase the risk of infection.
If the drain and soap are inaccessible, there are many low-cost ways to wash hands: pouring water out of a vibrant cany or bottleneck with its openings and (or) using the cattle, if necessary, as in developing countries; there are water-saving solutions in limited water (e.g. schools or rural areas in developing countries), such as knife pedal and other inexpensive options.
A knife crane with a foot pedal is a simple structure consisting of a container hanged on the rope and a knife lever that should be pressed for water to be poured into its hands, with a piece of soap to be used.
Effective hand grinding is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but some disputes are being held about the most effective form of drying in public toilet.
Increasing research shows that paper towels are far more hygienic than electric hands dryers that are installed in many toilet.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster in London sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Salphets and Flots was carried out, which was the subject of a comparison of paper canvas hygiene, warm-air lubricants and more modern fluxed hand dryers.
It was found that, after washing and drying hands in the warm air, the total number of bacteria on finger cushions increased by an average of 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the hands.
It has also been found that the total number of bacteria on finger pillows increases by 42 per cent after washing and drying hands in the airflow, and 15 per cent in the hands.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on fingers on average decreases to 76 per cent and 77 per cent in the hands.
The air dryer, which releases the air with declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), is capable of lifting microorganisms from the hands and from its own block and potentially contaminating other users of the toilet room and sanctuary in the radius to 2 metres.
The use of dried hands with warm air extends microorganisms in the radius to 0.25 metres from drying.
In 2005, TúV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study on the evaluation of different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria, depending on the hand drying method, are observed:
There are many different pieces of dryer for the hands, and hand dryers are compared to a piece of paper cloth.
Hand cleaning with disinfecting salphets can be an alternative solution during travel without soap and water.
The hand-disinfecting tool on a alcoholic basis shall contain at least 60 per cent of alcohol.
The medical method of hand was obligatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Zemmelweis found it effective (in 1846) to prevent sickness under fixed conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of these devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
The medical washing of the hands lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large quantity of soap, water, or helmet to wash each part of the hand.
Hands should be carefully teared against each other by twisting their fingers.
If there's mud under your fingernails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with a clean towel.
The paper towel should be used after the drying of the hands, closing the crane and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors.
This prevents re-pollution of hands from these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (“microbs”) and prevent their proliferation.
New England Journal of Medicine reports that the order of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical facilities: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
According to one study, correct hand washing and other basic procedures could reduce the level of catheter-related infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization published a leaflet with a standard procedure for washing and hand processing to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO draft hand health instruction is also available on its web site and open for public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in a co-sponsorship.
If compliance is required, commercial devices can be used to measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization denotes “five points” when the hands are needed:
after contact with blood or biological liquids,
before the use of anti-Septic as well as
Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap in hand washing (medicine) or antimicrobial soap helps to destroy bacteria.
Such anti-bacterial properties may be necessary before surgery is performed or in an environment of high organisms resistant to antibiotics. “Cleaning” of the hands before surgery requires a crane that can be switched on and off without its hands; a little chlorogexidine or iodine water should also be used to crawl hands, sterile towels to dry hands after washing, sterile patches for friction and other sterile cleaning tool.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and elbows usually within two to six minutes.
There's no need to tear your hands too long, for example, for 10 minutes.
During the strip, the water from the forearm shall not fall back on the hand hand.
After washing, the hands are dried with sterile tissues and wearing surgical clothing.
To reduce the spread of microbes, it is better to wash hands or use antiseptic for the hands before and after care.
In the hospitals, the first 20 per cent of washing was found to be the greatest benefit of the first 20 per cent of washing, and very few additional advantages were obtained when the frequency of hand was increased by more than 35 per cent.
In comparison with the washing of anti-bacterial soap, the usual washing of hands leads to more than three times the frequency of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food, compared with spiral and hand washing with an antibacterial soap, an average of 30 seconds per procedure, showed that hand processing with a spiral solution reduced the bacterial pollution by 26 per cent compared with the antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for hands, in terms of reducing the number of flu virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium Difficile dispute, which can include training of personnel in hand washing, increasing accessibility for alcoholic solvents, and written and oral reminders to staff on the need to wash hands.
Further research is required on the most effective measures in various health-care facilities.
In developing countries, washing of hands with soap has been recognized as an economically effective and important means of improving health and even digesting.
However, the lack of stable water, soap or hand washing at home, in schools and in the workplace makes it difficult to learn to wash hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas in Africa, there are far from every private or public toilet to clean hands, although there are cheap ways to organize hand washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene may also be caused by entrenched habits rather than lack of soap or water.
Promoting and stimulating hand washing with soap can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term changes in population behaviour.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results must be carried out.
The systemic analysis of 70 studies found that hygiene control at the community level was effective in countries with income under average levels, while public marketing campaigns were less effective, one example of advocacy for hand washing in schools was the United Nations United Nations Children's Fund Three Star Approach approach: it promoted the implementation in schools of simple economic measures that stimulated soap by students as well as other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase from one to three stars.
The installation of hand-wings is one of the possible measures in the hands-to-child hygiene campaigns to reduce morbidity and child mortality.
The Global Hand Washing Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children ' s Fund promotes the use of emosis that symbolizes the washing of hands.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in comparison with DALYs (secured years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more cost-effective solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the area of hand health: Ignazim Semmelweis, Hungarian physician Ignaz, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, English nurse, and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by rotten smells called myasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of health-related diseases and health-related infections, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States have become more proactive in promoting hand health as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of the pig influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, handmasters in public toilets and office buildings and airports were scattered with “managed hand washing equipment”.
The phrase “make hands” means the reluctance to accept responsibility for anything or to be a party to anything.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making a decision about the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; this phrase was subsequently more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play, Lady McBet begins to wash her hands in an attempt to clean up the imaginary spot symbolizing the unclean conscience in connection with the crimes she committed herself and induced her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act tended to wash their hands more often than others, and their hands were more important to them.
It is also less likely that people who had the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as volunteer activities.
In religions the washing of hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning: the symbolic washing of hands with water, but without soap is part of the ritual envisaged in many religions, including Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam, and religions also prescribe hygienic washing of their hands, especially after certain actions.
Induism, Judaism and Islam prescribe compulsory washing of their hands after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikh and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after every meal.
Manufacturer control of COVID-19
The control of production factors related to COVID-19 implies the application of labour safety and health techniques to control the risk and control of the coronarius of 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace risk control depends on place and work, based on risk assessment, the seriousness of the epidemic in the community and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID19.
The U.S. Office of Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that lower-risk posts have minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic measures are required to combat infection, including hand washing, encourage workers to stay at home in signs of disease, respect for respiratory ethics, and daily cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Middle-risk posts require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 but are likely to be infected by the current spread of disease in society or during international visits.
This may include workers who contact the public, such as schools, high-density work environments and some large retail shops.
Risk controls for such a group, in addition to basic preventive measures, include high-efficiency air filters, protective screens and affordable personal protection in the event of contact with a person infected by COVID19.
OSHA believes that medical and morgue personnel who have been contacted with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of contamination of COVID19 are at high risk, with the risk being increased to very high in the conduct of aerosol procedures by such staff, or the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
Risk controls suitable for such staff include the use of security engineering tools, such as ventilation rooms and personal protection tools suitable for the task.
The COVID19 flash may have a different impact on the workplace.
Workers may not be available in the workplace because of their own illness, the need to care for other persons or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial templates may vary in terms of both the types of goods for which the demand is available and the ways in which such goods can be purchased (e.g. purchases in non-picical periods of delivery or maintenance without leaving the car).
Finally, there could be a disruption of the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19, and the Plan for the Preparedness for the Epidemic and Responses could be used in the organization of protection.
Plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of contamination, the risk factors arising from houses and communities, and the risk factors of individual workers, such as age or chronic illness.
Plans also indicate the controls necessary to address such risks, as well as plans for emergency activities for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Plans for preparedness for the epidemic and response may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of virus among staff, protect people who are more at risk of serious health complications, maintain business operations and minimize negative effects on other organizations in their supply chains.
Reactions are affected by the seriousness of disease in the business community.
Risk control hierarchy is a structure widely used for labour safety and hygiene to group such funds depending on efficiency.
In the event that the risk of COVID-19 is not addressed, the most efficient security equipment is engineering, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection.
Security engineering means the isolation of staff from jobs ' risk sites and does not rely on the behaviour of the employee, which may be the most economically beneficial solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action from the employee or staff member.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but can help address some risks.
All types of personal protection shall be selected according to the threat to the worker, fit in size (e.g. respirators), used continuously and appropriately, regularly checked, properly maintained and replaced as required, and correctly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Office of Labour Protection and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that posts with the lowest risk have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all jobs include frequent and careful hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with respiratory ethics, including coughing and shaking, salpheth and garbage containers, readiness to remote or replacement work, as appropriate, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially contaminated persons is a critical step to protect workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases stay at home before the end of heat, no higher body temperatures and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of jars or other medications that address symptoms, and that there be flexibility on hospital leaves, allow staff to stay at home to care for a sick family member and ensure that staff are aware of such policies.
According to OSHA, middle-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with people who have no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19, but are likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in connection with the spread of disease in society in the business territory or in connection with the recent visits of such a person to COVID-19.
These categories include workers who have contact with the public, such as schools, a high population density work environment and some major retail shops.
In rare cases, respirators may be required for employees of such a risk group.
If a person has been ill in the plane, the proper safety of employees and other passengers is required by measures such as isolation of the sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointment of a crew member to care for a sick person, provision of a sick mask or requesting a person to cover his nose and his mouth with a cough or chasing.
Secondary crew members shall carry one-time medical gloves when approaching a patient traveller or when they are connected with physiological liquids or potentially infected surfaces and possibly additional personal protections if the patient has heat, regular cough or breathing difficulties.
The gloves used and other single-time items should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In case of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger vessels, safety measures include delays in the event of sickness, self-inclusion and immediate information on a medical centre on the ship, if there are heat or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, medical examinations should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such person; in the case of schools and childcare institutions, CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning or disinfecting if the infected person was in the school building, irrespective of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
Where there is a minimum or medium incidence of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as cancellation of visits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical or choir-sing activities, cafeteria meals, increased distance between parties, time management of arrival and care, limitation of non-existent visits, use of a separate location of health care facilities for children with influenza symptoms.
At a significant rate of proliferation in the local community, other than social distance strategies, measures may be considered to be long-term non-school measures; for law enforcement officials with daily responsibilities, the health risks are considered to be low, according to CDC.
Law enforcement officials obliged to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of contamination of COVID19 are encouraged to follow the same instructions that are required by the ambulance facilitators, including the use of appropriate personal protection.
When closely contacted during detention, workers should clean and disinfect their formable belts and equipment before reuse by domestic cleaning aerosols or by countering them, comply with standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of disease and to dispose of used personal protections, and to use and wash clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include health care, support, laboratories and medical transport staff contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID19 infections.
They have a very high risk of infection in their aerosol procedures, or in the collection/ processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or alleged COVID-19.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol education include sensing, coughing, bronchoscopic procedures, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling invasive techniques.
Morgoes workers with high risk include those working on the treatment of persons with confirmed disease or suspicion of infection of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if such personnel carry out autopsy, they fall into a very high-risk category; additional engineering and safety for such groups include the use of insulated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In some health and morgue institutions, the use of a special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Probations should be addressed in accordance with biological safety precautionary measures 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends distributing patients to the dispersed waiting zones depending on the suspicion of contamination of COVID19. In addition to other personal protections, OSHA recommends that respirators be used to interact with patients at a distance of up to 6 feet with confirmed disease or suspicion of contamination by SARS-CV-2, as well as those conducting procedures accompanied by aerosol education.
In the United States, the NIOSH respirators for the N95 filter or higher class must be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory programme, which indicates the requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide better protection and comfort for the staff member. WHO does not recommend special treatment, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for staff performing screening at the point of patient reception.
Individuals collecting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients or transmitters without aerosol procedures, WHO recommends wearing surgical masks, shields, or a protective screen for the person, coat and gloves.
In procedures accompanied by aerosol, the respirator of N95 or FFP2 should be carried instead of surgical mask.
Given the inadequacy of individual protection tools worldwide, WHO recommends that the need for such remedies be minimized through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, access to patients infected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only the means of personal protection required for a specific task, the continued use of the same respirator, while working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and the recommendation not to use masks for persons without symptoms.

COVER: [Covid-19] Load relief and preparations for the future
DATA/REMA OF AMENDMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DEVELOPMENTS: CC0: No protected rights
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interrelationships of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have not had precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability to sympathize, cooperate and develop communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have observed the communal and caring relationships between all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic correspondence, calls and chats, a remarkable proof of the fact that, fortunately, we are working with amazing people.
I'm very grateful and proud to talk about you as colleagues.
Last week, I was told that we appreciated our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible through your work, whether to make websites work, to pay our colleagues or to protect the security of communities.
The world needs the information presented in Wikipedia, and it's even more important today than ever before.
At a time to achieve meaningful results for peace, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together from the coming week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and schedules
As earlier said by Robin, the c-team team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
As we communicate, we have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The vast majority of us wanted to remove tensions and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, then let it happen.
For all staff, contractors and non-staff staff:
On our expectations, we will have to work around 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next order is issued.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; whatever your needs, be it for family, to acquire food, or to go to a doctor, your well-being is our priority number one.
We're not watching your working hours.
If you're ill, you shouldn't work.
That is understandable and undeniable, but we mention it.
It is not necessary to prepare a hospital sheet or a vacation: simply inform your manager and help the team to revise the calendar and work schedule to ensure that key areas are covered.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, please report to Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and due attention from management to your situation).
The full payment of hourly rates will be made.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to meet our obligations to our contractors and staff at an hourly rate of pay.
Each person will be paid under normal hourly rates in normal circumstances.
This includes periods of sickness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can have remarkable results, especially in such times.
Again, it's self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your leader so that we can know what to expect, and we can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some work is considered substantial.
We must always support such activities.
The SPE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (in addition) are performing critical work, for which additional support may be required.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current objectives and to focus on providing support, which is essential to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most important projects.
Deceleration today does not mean the negative effects in the future.
We do not plan to work “two more to get lost” after the pandemic ends.
You will not have to work overtime to meet unreal time frames for the present.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What happens to APP (annual plans)?
To adjust to the new realities and expectations of daily working hours, we intend to adjust our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose extending the deadline for our plan for 2019-2020, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff to give priority to critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while all who need or want to work will be given a reduced timetable for the next few weeks.
Such extensions significantly reduce the current workload of planning and tension throughout the organization.
Next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the following steps immediately after receiving the relevant confirmation.
Thank the APP team for taking the lead in this work.
Office status, risks and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with COVID19.
However, in addition to many precautions, we hired an anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all the surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus decisions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator lounges, through which access to our floor is possible.
The building applies its own rules requiring caution using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the district of Colombia (DC) is on the Web Company WeWork, which shared with us and all DC personnel its rules relating to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in Colombian district moved completely to remote work according to instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York are aware, we also discussed the rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues work away for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work away are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended that meetings be limited to one or two hours.
If there is a need for longer sessions, consider dividing them into a course of several days.
Clearly identify the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and outline the material for the study.
By default, use video links to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
To be convenient, designate a focal point, a person who will monitor the entry of questions in the Chat and monitor the list of speakers as well as the one responsible for conducting notes (or joint observation).
If necessary, please contact the E-mail Technical Support Service.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program for the purchase of food.
Connect to the #remots channel at Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the ergonomics manuals available in web-based format to facilitate the effectiveness of the distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the community to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such abolition and other restrictions may impede the inability of concerted grant activities, and no one will be fined for the forced delays or changes in such objectives.
We will follow up on the week ahead with further guidance on Wikimania, as well as on other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
General sentiments in the global community are not only a frustration for interrupting work, but also a sense of relief in connection with understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to prospects, the CRT works on the Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in contact with COVID19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00.PT.
This time, we will take advantage of the opportunity to share further relevant information, to answer your questions and to spend time together with each other.
We are together in this situation and ready to help all that we can.
In doing so, you can continue to receive information from such electronic correspondence and other important information on COVID-19 from the Office of Wiki.
The CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one location.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
Where travel, activities, key workflows, illumination problems or other assistance are available, contact the CRT.
We stand ready to provide support and liaison as necessary.
If confidentiality problems arise, please contact Brian Judan, Director of International Global Operations, by e-mail to Bryan Judan.
No such change should be seen as a renunciation of our work and our commitments.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible ongoing need for a fundamentally new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and provide the opportunity to continue to work, in order to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the world through the necessary services.
Our planning work will wait until time is right.
It is now time to support each other and create a space for important work to come in future weeks and perhaps months.
For this to happen, we need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families and to work with the maximum of your share as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lyan L, Ryan M, Tony S) and the remaining members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the appropriate angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution to treat cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as the entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a cinking metalferment located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-end peptide domain M2 and the C-end transport domain of the renal amino acid flask.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane protein type I, and its fermentative domain falls on the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The intermediate domain of ACE2 is patched away from the transmemembered domain by another enzyme known as a steed, and the resulting dissolved protein is released into the bleeding and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most of the alveolar cells of type II lungs, the internocrates of thin intestines, the arterial and venous endotelial cells and the smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 is also found in the brain cortex, stratum, hypothalamus, and brain trunk.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE counterweight.
ACE breaks the hormone angiotensin I into receptacle angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, leaks a carboximal ending amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into a vasodylateur angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also break a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] Bradikinin, appellate, neurotensin, dinormine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of neutral SLC6A19 amino acids and is present for Hartnup disease.
As a transplant protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronators, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS virus); and SARS-CV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Strictly speaking, linking S1 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to an ACE2 enzyme on the surface of the cells leads to endocytosis and transposition of both the virus and the enzyme into the inner cells.
This incoming process also requires a S serin protasis proteise of TMPRSS2, which is currently being considered a potential therapeutic tool, which has led some to the idea that a reduction in ACE2 levels in cells can help to combat infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend that inhibitors of APF and BRA continue to use standard therapy.
According to a systematic review and metaanalysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of APF inhibitors was due to a significant reduction of the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced by patients who received APF inhibitors who were more at risk of pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in the death rate from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than those with a general risk of pneumonia.”
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be new in therapy for acute pulmonary damage and likely to improve the pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in obese with acute respiratory malnutrition caused by lipopolisarides.
The rhACE2 semi-emission period is about 10 hours, and the start of operation is 30 minutes, in addition to 24 hours of exposure.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 can be a promising tool for people with the non-transmission of classic inhibitors of the renin angiotensin system (RAS ingibilators) or in diseases where the circular angiotensin II has been increased. The RhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical testing for acute respiratory distributives.
Annexes COVID-19 are mobile phone applications designed to assist in the epidemiological investigation of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons (contacts) that could contact the infected person.
In some regions, many of the annexes formally supported by the authorities have been developed or proposed.
Several options have been developed to monitor contacts.
This led to a discussion on issues of confidentiality, particularly with regard to those systems based on tracking the geographical location of applications users.
More soft in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would join their integration efforts in supporting such applications based on Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, launched an annex that allows citizens to check whether they had contact with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities and is used in Singapore by a TraceTogether annex.
The annex was developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be subject to control by the Government. North Macedonia launched the StopKorona! annex, which works on Bluetooth, which helps monitor contacts with potentially infected people and ensures rapid communication with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the annex was expected to register at Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking annex was in the final stage of development and would be available for deployment within a few weeks, and similar annexes are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering the use of applications based on the Singapore TraceTogether annex and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use the Geosoning Application, which aims to ensure that patients with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security, Cambridge University, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise from applications, including false responses and potential inefficiencies if the application is used only by a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the spread of deceptive or harmful “coron-virus” applications, Apple restricted the list of types of organizations that could propose its coronary annexes to App Store, including only “official” or other trustworthy organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Participants in the confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised as to whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the crownavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for the limitation of such oversight.
The organizations announced the eight conditions they placed on public projects:
Monitoring should be “legally, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by limitation clauses;
The use of data should be limited to the aims of combating the dissemination of COVID-19;
The safety and anonymity of the data shall be protected and evidence of such protection shall be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of aggravation of discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be determined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse must be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also published their lists of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of permanent observation, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as it is necessary.
In some countries, location tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to load the application and the possibility of avoiding tracking.
In Israel, the network tracking was approved.
Network solutions that have access to reference data on location also have high potential problems with confidentiality.
However, not all central server systems should have access to personal location data; a number of confidential systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system that did not use the annexes as a basis was used to monitor contacts.
Instead of using a special annex, the system collected information on tracking from various sources, including tracking data for mobile devices and transactions with maps, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to prevent citizens from contacting infected persons, but has also made information on the placement of publicly accessible, which is possible because of significant changes in the law on protection of information that have been made since the MERS outbreak in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites, and countries, including Germany, consider using both centralized systems and systems that maintain confidentiality.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been made public.
The monitoring of contacts with confidentiality is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dated at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than 10 expert groups were working on decisions that ensure confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record user approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized traces of confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mechanisms for tracking mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identification of the personal data never leaves the device and all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that maintains confidentiality in collecting and using location data or crossing pathways for tracking the dissemination of COVID-19.
The work of the platform is based on studies in the document “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic”, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company developing technology for confidentiality, which was also originally founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses robust hardware technologies to enable users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN global coalition, aimed at reducing the fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of the applications for monitoring and reporting, was based on the same approach and using similar protocols, which is a key factor in their wide distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the work of mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced an initiative to monitor contacts that they claimed would ensure confidentiality, based on a combination of Bluetooth technology Low Energy and Cryptography to keep confidential.
They also published the technical characteristics of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system has to be deployed in three phases:
Deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of citizens infected by the coronavirus but with data confidentiality
Integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of continuous surveillance, first put the system in place through the updating of the operating system and then remove it in the same way after the threat disappeared.
Responding a drug (also known as reprofiling, redirection, task change or therapeutic transfer of drugs) is a reprofiling of the approved medicine for treatment of a disease or a medical condition other than that originally prescribed for development.
This is one of the areas of research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other studies include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and transfusion of reconnaissance plasma.
The analysis of these linking sites provides a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papaline-like protaza, RNA-dependent RNA-Polimeraza, helicas, S proteins and ADPF-ribosphateza.
Hussein AA and co-authors, in their Doclinic study, studied several of the candidate compounds that were subsequently optimized and analysed their similarity to the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorochin is a anti-malarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some automy-immune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorochin and its associated hydroxychlorochine would be among the four medications examined in the “Solidarity” clinical test.
Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that testing of chlorochine and hydroxychlorochine would begin in New York on 24 March. On 28 March, FDA permitted the use of hydroxychlorochine sulphate and chlorochine phosphate in accordance with an emergency permit for use (EUA).
The treatment scheme has not been approved during the FDA clinical test process and is permitted in accordance with EUA only as a pilot treatment for emergency care for patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated under clinical test schemes.
CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychlorochin consumption for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CV-2 infection” had not yet been established.
Doctors say they use a drug when there's no other way out.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chlorochine in conjunction with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale studies are being conducted at the University of Duca and Oxford.
The New York University Medical School in Langon is studying the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of the use of hydroxychlorochine.
China’s clinical tests in Huhan and Shenchhen have shown that the favipira is “simplely effective”.
The 35 patients in Shenchen, who received the drug, received an average of 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take the drug had 11 days.
In Huhan, a study was carried out to monitor 240 pneumonia patients, one half of whom received a favipirier and the other half was a Umiphenoyn.
The Italian pharmaceutical department reminded the public that the results of the drug ' s effectiveness were scarce and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that a drug would be purchased in Japan to replenish its stocks and that military resources would be used for its delivery to university hospitals where the drug would be used to treat patients with COVID19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Cinzo Abe reported to the Trump Administration that the drug could be purchased, and it might be less effective in cases of illness.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who try to get pregnant.
One study on the combination of anti-virus drugs, Phopinavire and ritovire (Caletra), concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been identified”.
Preparates have been developed to inhibit HIV by linking to protazz.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado seeks to modify medicines to find a connection that will be linked to SARS-CoV-2 protazz. The scientific community criticizes the reprofiling of drugs that have been specifically designed to treat HIV and AIDS.
WHO has included a combination of lopinavira and ritonevira in the international “Solidarity” test.
Remdeciviir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences to treat the Ebola virus and Marborburg virus infections, followed by the discovery by Gilead Sciences that the remdeciviir has an anti-virus activity in vitro with regard to many filo, pneumonia, paramixo and coronaviruses.
One problem related to antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies show that the remdesiver may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and several clinical tests are under way, including two Cleveland University clinics; one is carried out on patients with moderate forms of disease and the other on patients with a heavier form.
Three clinical tests are currently under way for intravenous vitamin C for people hospitalized with a serious form of COVID19: two плаcebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, the State of New York began its testing of Asian antibiotics.
The Japan National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclesonid) Tejin, an inhalation corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for the treatment of pre-simptom patients infected by the new coronavirus.
Phase II, form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, has been tested with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of disease in order to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Institute of Heart Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with poorly expressed symptoms of COVID19.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who had diagnosed COVID19 with light symptoms that did not require hospitalization were invited.
Pregnant breastfeeding and not using effective contraception methods, women cannot participate in the study.
There are several coagulants on the test in Italy.
The niche cellular heparin is widely used to treat patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicine Authority to publish recommendations for the use of the drug.
On 14 April, Italy announced a multi-central study involving 300 patients to study the use of sodium enxaparine in preventive and therapeutic doses.
Since SARS-CV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on reprofiling approved anti-virus drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and West Neil virus.
Ribbyrin: The fishermen were recommended for COVID19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations.
Umiphenovanizer: Recommended for COVID-19 treatment in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics, which have been considered potentially suitable for the treatment of COVID19:
Tocilysumab (Anti-L-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID19.
The COVID-19 Vaccination is a hypothetical vaccine against the Crown of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been tested, many attempts to develop such a vaccine continue.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that a vaccine against the SARS-CV-2 virus would be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent phase I security studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the major outbreak of this disease spread throughout the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and related research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, productive capacity, extensive deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technology platforms for establishing an effective vaccine against COVID19.
Some of the main objectives of the platforms included in the security studies of phase I are:
Nuclein acid (DNC and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, IRC-1273)
viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, Adenovirus Vector Type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are at an early stage of development, 78 are used in approved active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute); further 37 vaccines were reported, but few available (probably under planning or development).
Phase I-II pre-tests for safety and immunogenity are normally randomized, placebo-controlled and in several sites with simultaneous definitions of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III usually covers more participants, including the control group; at this stage, medicines are tested for the effectiveness of disease prevention and side effects are monitored while optimal dosing.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were still undergoing human tests (there are still in the Doclinic Studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular repression vaccine that genetically modified virus proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the commencement of work on its own vaccine to start testing in people in 2021.
The vaccine projects were also launched at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, headed by Hanek Schwitmeiker, announced the start of work on the establishment of their vaccine.
Jansen, together with his Biotechnology partner Vaxart, develops a oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a technology vaccine similar to that used for vaccination against cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the Research Institute announced the completion of vaccine synthesis and the start of testing.
On February 27, 2020, the daughter company Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was initiating a project to develop the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their aim was to develop a vaccine candidate that could be protested in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Medical Research and Material Command, Fort Detrick, and the Army Research Institute of Walter Reid, Silver Spring, located in the western state of Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccines.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novax Inc.
To develop and produce vaccines.
Partners also announced plans for the conduct of the Doclinic Tests and the Clinical Test of Phase I by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients and that even in an expedited vaccine development regime, it would take at least one and a half to two years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, the biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that, with partial funding from the Canadian Health Research Institute, they had created a particle like the Crowavirus.
Potential vaccine is carried out by laboratory research, and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Previously this week The Guardian reported that President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German Government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the U.S. Pfeder pharmaceutical company announced a partnership with the German BioNTech company for joint development of an IRNC-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNC-based vaccine; a drug is currently undergoing doclinary tests and clinical tests will commence in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive the results of the Doclinic tests, and their final vaccine candidate could start testing on people in autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the COVID-19 Innovation Coalition for the Preparedness of the Epidemics (CEPI), France, announced the investment of $4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine development consortium, with the participation of the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that researchers had started testing six different candidates for animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-emplified RNA-Vaccin from COVID-19.
A vaccine prepatriate was developed within 14 days of succession from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of $275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID19, including the development of multiple candidates for vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Approximately at the same time, the Canadian Government has announced $192 million specifically for the development of a COVID19 vaccine, as well as plans for the establishment of a national “bank of vaccines”, which will include a number of new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the crownvirus.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University Medical School reported on the testing of PittCoVac, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 on mice, stating that “MNA introduced sub-divided SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines, causing strong responses to antigen special antigen [in mice] that occurred two weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Farmacectic School of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential DNA vaccine that might be released in the form of a nasal spear.
The DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and form harmless virus particles that can stimulate the immune system to develop antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities merged the resources of IBM supercomputers, combined with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-special effects.
This means that they may have other advantages in addition to those of disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4,170 health workers.
vaccines may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies on vaccine efficiency assessment with animal models, for which COVID-19 is characterized, such as ACE2 transgender mouses, other laboratory animals and low primates, indicate the need for measures to control the infection with biosafety level 3 in the treatment of living viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized security procedures.
Vaccinations against SARS and MERS were tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there are no drugs or a protective vaccine for the treatment of SARS that are safe and effective for people.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide, and there is no vaccine tested against MERS.
When MERS was launched, it was believed that the SARS study that had been conducted at that time could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed phase I of clinical testing in persons, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus vector vaccines and were in the development process, two are adoviral (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one — MVA-vectoral (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of conspiracy was spread in social networks, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new and that it already exists.
Publications in social networks quoted the words of some patients who claimed genetic sequences of other coronavirus strains, such as the SARS cronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) that is a communicable disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, cough and breathing constraints.
Other symptoms may include a sense of fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The incidence of symptoms from the first to the peak is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases involve light symptoms, but in some cases the disease becomes pneumonia and polyorganic inadequacy.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, and more than 153,000 died of the disease.
More than 568,000 people have been rehabilitated, and mostly the virus is spread with people close to each other, often through microscopic drops released in coughing, chewing, or talking.
Although these droplets are formed at breathing, they usually pose a threat to land or surface, but are not transmitted through long distances.
People are also infected with the contaminated surface and then with their eyes, noses, or mouths.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most contagious in the first three days after symptoms, although it can be spread both before symptoms and at later stages.
The use of medical masks is recommended to patients with suspicion of disease, as well as to those who care for them.
The recommendations on the use of medical masks differ: some agencies recommend that they not be used at all, some recommend their use and others require it.
At present, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Local infections have been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or have symptoms of influenza, such as fever, cough, fatigue and breathing.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or a feeling of compression in the chest, confusion of consciousness, problems of awakening, facial or lip deterioration; if the above symptoms are present, urgent medical assistance should be sought.
Symptoms of high - breathing diseases, such as sneezes, pulps, or pain in the throat, can be diminished.
Also, different percentage ratios of venom and intestine symptoms, such as boiling, vomiting and diarrhoea, are observed.
Some of the cases reported in China were initially shown only by a sense of breast pressure and increased heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress through pneumonia, polyorganic inadequacy, and ultimately death.
This is called the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is usually between five and six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5 per cent of people, symptoms start to occur within 11.5 days of infection and, according to available data, the symptoms do not occur in all infected persons.
The role of such unsymptom-free carriers in the transmission of the disease is still unknown, but preliminary data indicate that they can contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of people infected with unsimplemented infections is currently unknown and is only studied, and Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus were unsymptomal.
China ' s National Health Commission has begun to include unsymptomous cases in its daily report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported on that day, 130 (78 per cent) have refused unsymptomous at the time of testing.
Both wet and slut can have a greater concentration of the virus.
There are more droplets in the air when speaking loudly than the normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore revealed that droplets can be extended to a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) when the cough is open.
The virus is generally not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Science suggests that the transmission of particles of the virus by bioaerosol is still possible, and the testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside the rooms has shown the existence of a virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiovascular resilience (ASD), can lead to the dispersal of extraction products and, consequently, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also fears that the virus can be spread through facalia, but the risk is considered low: the virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms occur, but the risk is small.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argues that it is not yet clear how easily the virus is spread, however, it is known that one patient is commonly infected by two to three other persons; the virus is able to survive from hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that the virus could live for one day on the cardboard surface, on the plastic surface (polypropiled) and on the stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on 99 per cent of the copper surfaces up to four hours.
These indicators, however, vary according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and cleaning tools, with their proper use, have a relatively useful effect on the control of contamination: soap destroys the fat-protection layer of the virus by deactivated in this way and can also remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxydine gluconat (chyrurgical disinfectant) are less effective against the virus, and in a study in Hong Kong, samples of slums were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients had the first test showing the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and the sixth patient had the highest blood content on the second day of the test.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome that has been detected for the first time by three persons with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of a new SARS-CV-2 virus are also found in coronavirus kinship.
Outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by a domestic soap that uncovers its protective shell. SARS-CV-2 is closely linked to the source SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most susceptible organ COVID-19, as the virus enters the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in the alveolar cells of type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and penetrates into the hostage cage by means of a characteristic surface glycoprotein, a “storm” (peplomer).
12 per cent of the infected people in the Uhan hospital have diagnosed severe injuries to the myocardium, which are more common in the form of a serious disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic combustion response and immune disorders occurring during the progress of the disease, but acute damage to the myocardium may also be due to the presence of receptors ACE2 in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are present in large quantities as they are involved in the work of that body.
The high frequency of trombosis (31 per cent) and venombolia (25 per cent) was observed in patients in ITU from COVID19 and could indicate unfavourable forecasts.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropical aCE2-expressive respiratory cells, there are symptoms of systemic hyper-expression in patients with a heavy COVID-19.
In particular, it was found that the pathogenic T-CSF cells were correlled with revolving inflammatory IL-6 monocytes and heavy lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Limmphociary infiltrates were also detected during the autopsy.
WHO has also published several test protocols on this disease.
A low chain reaction in real-time (RT-CP) is a standard test method.
The test shall normally be carried out on respiratory samples obtained by rhino-wheeling, but the nose or wet masculine model may also be used.
The results are usually ready for a period of between hours and two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two samples of blood taken at a interval of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strain of the coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists around the world can develop the tests by means of a polymerial chain reaction (PCD) to identify the existence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect infections at the present time, as well as possible infections in the past, were under development but not yet widely disseminated.
China ' s experience with research on the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was only 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first local diagnosis test, authorizing it to be applied at the end of this month.
Bilateral longitudinal sub-pleural concentrations of the type of mat glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterio distribution are frequent symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Sub-pleural dominance, the symptom of a coated bridge (treaty drainage of a variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic defeats and pathophysiology COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological research carried out when opening:
Macroscopy: pleuvrit, pericardite, bleaching and lungs
There are four types of gravity of virus pneumonia:
light form of pneumonia: light coat, hyperpalasis of pneumocytes, large aptic pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphociary infiltraction and formation of multinuclear giant cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: Diffузal alveolar damage (DAD) with a diffuse alveolar escort.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distributors and heavy hypoxemia.
Resistant pneumonia: organization of escorts in alveolar and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diftose inward drainage (DHC syndrome); leukoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of contamination include staying at home, avoiding people's places, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with the rules of breathing hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with indifferent hands.
CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a salphette of coughing or chewing, or, in the absence of a salphette, cover the mouth and nose with the inside side of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or chewing, it is recommended that a quality hygienic procedure be carried out for the hands.
The Centre for Illness Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of cloth masks in public places, inter alia, to curb the transmission of infections to people with unsymptomous infections, social distance strategies aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; schools and enterprises were closed, citizens were restricted and large public activities were abolished.
The distance recommendations also mean that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no medications with evidence of effectiveness against COVID19, since the completion of vaccine development is expected no earlier than 2021, the main part of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the peak of the epidemic known as “plato outward”.
CDC also recommends more often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet or with severe hand pollution, and before eating and after the shrinking, coughing or sneeze.
CDC also recommends that a hand-processing tool should be used for disinfecting alcohol (at least 60 per cent) but only when soap and water are not available. WHO provides two recipes for local production to the regions where such disinfectives are not sold.
These compositions use ethanol or ispropanol with antimicrobial activity.
The hydrogen transfusion is used to remove bacterial disputes in alcohol and is not a suitable tool for anti-septical hand processing.
Glycerol is added as a wetland.
Patients are shown supporting therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support and support for other affected vital bodies.
CDC recommends that those suspected of infected with the virus wear a common medical mask.
Extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address breathing deficiencies, but its benefits are still being explored.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet be respected.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with light symptoms at the early stages of the disease. WHO and China ' s National Health Commission issued recommendations on care for patients hospitalized with COVID19.
In the United States, intensive therapists and pulmonologists summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (accetaminophen) rather than ibprofen.
In the course of procedures in which air-cape emissions, such as intubation or backdrop, precautionary measures are required to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
The CDC recommends that medical caregivers from COVID-19 be placed in an air-capital unit (AIR) as an additional measure in addition to standard precautionary measures in terms of contact and air. CDC published recommendations on the use of individual defences (SIDs) during the pandemic.
Recommendations for individual protection: protective coat, respirator or medical mask, eye protection and gloves; rather than medical masks are preferred from the above.
Respirators N95 are approved for use in industrial conditions, but FDA has allowed these respirators to be used in accordance with an emergency permit for use (EUA).
They are designed to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but when using a directive, the protection of a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends the use of protective face displays or, in the extreme case, the manufacture of masks on its own in household conditions.
In most cases, the COVID-19 form is not heavy enough to require artificial ventilation of the lung or its alternative, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory insufficiency associated with COVID-19 is currently being studied extensively, with some evidence that intuitions can be avoided by a nose of oxygen with intensive air flows or a two-level positive breathing pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways are critical for patients as effective as IWL.
Some doctors make a choice for invasive mechanical venting of lungs, if available, as this method substantially limits the spread of particles in the air compared to the nose canals with intensive air flows, the risk of severe illness for older persons (over 60 years and especially those over 80 years of age) much higher.
In many developed countries, hospital cats are scarce per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
According to one study in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy offices, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4 per cent had died.
In China, about 30 per cent of the people hospitalized with COVID19 are eventually intensive.
The artificial ventilation of the lungs is compounded, as the acute respiratory distributor (ARDS) that develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming increasingly problematic.
Inhalation pressures and ADCs are required for the delivery of a maximum quantity of oxygen to the lungs and for the provision of a minimum ventilation damage to which the pneumotarox may develop.
High Ventilators may not be available in earlier fan models.
Potential treatment studies began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are currently under clinical tests.
Remdesivir is the most promising.
The development of new medicines may last until 2021, but some of the medications tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the last test stages.
Anti-virusive drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers are involved in the testing of the effectiveness and security of potential treatments. FDA has provided temporary permission to use reconnaissance plasma as a pilot treatment where human life is at risk of serious or immediate risk.
It was not subject to clinical research to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat outbreaks of disease.
Users shall enter their name and identification number for the login.
The annex may detect “draw close contact” through observation data and thus determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the annex not only recommends self-sustainment but also sends notification to local health authorities, an analysis of the large data collected from mobile phones, the detection technology, the tracking of mobile phones and artificial intelligence, such tools are used to track infected people and people they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized the security authorities to monitor mobile phones of people suspected to be infected by the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure the penalty and protection of persons who may contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, with the aim of investigating and preventing the spread of Deutsche Telekom virus, it provided aggregated data on the location of cellular subscribers to the federal public institutions of Germany and the Robert Koha Institute.
In Russia, a person recognition technology was introduced to identify carantine violators.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner, Julio Galler, said that cellular network operators reported that “40 per cent of the people still move across the territory”.
The Government of Germany conducted a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with over 42,000 participants.
President Cersti Kalulaid of Estonia also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Aggravated social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic recession are ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being”.
The disease may flow lightly with minor or missing symptoms that resemble other prevalent upper respiratory diseases, such as a common cold.
Slow patients tend to recover for two weeks, whereas heavy or critical patients may need three to six weeks in order to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of getting heavy COVID-19 on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although there are no such data for COVID-19; some people have COVID-19 may be hit by light and cause pneumonia as complications.
Those with the most severe leakage of COVID19 may rapidly progress into a acute respiratory distributor (ARDS) causing respiratory deficiencies, septic shock or polyorganismal inadequacy.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalic trumping, and heart problems, kidneys and liver.
Trombonization anomaly, especially an increase in pro-Trombine time, was described by 6 per cent of patients who had entered the hospital from COVID-19 while the kidney function was broken by 4 per cent of the group.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients from COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transnaminas).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days for patients transferred to an intensified therapy.
Studies in early cases indicate that the average time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days with a full range of between six and 41 days.
According to a study carried out by the China National Health Commission (NHC), the rate of death among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopatological studies on the death of lung samples show defuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exposures in both lungs.
Virus cytopatic changes were observed in pneumonia.
A sharp respiratory syndrome (SADS) was similar to the appearance of light.
In the 11.8 per cent of the deaths registered by China ' s National Health Commission, the heart problems were to raise the troponine or heart stop.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had pre-health problems, and access to health resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates varied depending on the condition because of these regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective calculations of light-form cases can lead to an overstatement of mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of past diseases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers have developed severe symptoms of COVID-19 as a whole 1.4 times more frequently, and such patients are about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or die in comparison to non-smokers, and concerns were raised about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of one Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who had recovered from the disease had reduced their light volume by 20 to 30 per cent and had detected damage.
After healing, this may also lead to the syndrome “after intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients recovered from the virus had a persistent immunity against them.
This is considered likely by other coronavirus, but also reported cases where the COVID-19 tests on the coronavirus were still positive after healing.
In these cases, it is believed that the prolonged course of the disease has been protracted rather than reinfected.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has an animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to the transmission of it from human beings.
A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls 1 December 2019 the earliest date of the first case.
According to official data published by WHO, the date was 8 December 2019.
Several methods are used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time of the disease, which also affects the level of testing, the quality of health systems, the treatment schemes used, the time from the outbreak of the disease and the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO awarded emergency-aid codes for ICB10: U07.1 for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2. The rate of deaths and infections is the number of deaths committed to diagnosed cases within a given period of time.
According to Jones Hopkins University statistics, as of 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and contamination cases is 6.9 per cent (153,822/2 240,191).
This figure varies from region to region, and some other methods include the definition of the mortality rate due to the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died as a result of the disease, as well as the definition of the mortality rate resulting from the transmission of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosed as well as non-diagnostic cases) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are not tied to a specific time and reflect a specific population from the time of contamination to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced by all patients who have been infected, these antibodies are available to understand how many people have been infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castillone D'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7 per cent) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease was spread during the celebration of carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany ' s health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood figures.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates differs between men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is reduced only from the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise causes of this discrepancy are unknown but may be genetic and behavioural.
Gender immunological differences, the lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with male diseases (e.g. hypertonia in men younger than in women) can lead to a higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of the infected were men, and 72 per cent of the deaths of COVID19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not maintain gender statistics for COVID19.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORVI have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women, respectively, more likely to become infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID19.
The WHO leader, Mr. Tedros Aden Gébreisus, explains: “CO” means “corona”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” is “disease”, and 19 is the year when the flash was first detected: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations on the prevention of stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called the heavy coronavirus respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CV-2).
In WHO public communications, the terms “virus COVID-19” and “virus responsible for COVID-19” are added.
Both the disease and the virus itself are commonly referred to as the “coronating virus”.
During the initial outbreak in Ouhan, China, virus and disease were commonly referred to as “Coronavirus” and “Hungarian crownvirus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical locations in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the term “sharp respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, the official titles COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published.
Due to the limitations on standard supply chains, some digital service producers print medical materials, such as tampon tubes for nose strokes, as well as the details of IWL devices.
In one such case, the Italian Clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time frames, then one of the local productions was reprofiled and was able to print the required 100 valves in the night.
Since the first time COVID-19, various conspiracy, disinformation and frail information on the origin of the virus, its scope, prevention, treatment and other aspects have become available on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect the virus of other animals.
Research has not confirmed the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At present, there is no approved vaccine against virus or medicine for treatment.
Various international studies of vaccines and medicines from COVID19 are being carried out by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims at assessing the treatment effect of the four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
There is no vaccine ready yet, but various organizations are actively developing candidates for vaccines.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate human cells through the ACE2 receptor, so research results from previous SARS-CoV studies are used.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers seek to create a vibrant vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at causing a rapid immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunit vaccine, aims at creating a vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies are aimed at destroying S-shiv protein, which helps the virus enter the receptor of the enzyme ACE2.
The third strategy is the development of vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNCs or RNAs-vaccines, a new vaccine approach).
Experimental vaccines developed for any of these strategies should be tested for security and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
Vaccin contains a harmless genetic code copied from a disease-generating virus, which has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests have been conducted.
Preparates approved for malaria treatment were evaluated in seven tests, four of which were hydroxychlorochine or chlorochine.
The reprofiling of anti-virus drugs is a large part of Chinese research; by the end of April, nine studies of Remdecivier phase III were conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for treatment of COVID19 was carried out, and several other existing anti-virus drugs for treatment of COVID19, including remdesiveir, chlorochein and hydroxychlorochin, rapinavir / ritonevire, as well as latinauir / ritonvire, combined with beta interferone.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of the rodecivier.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients receiving remdesivers as an exception.
Phase III of clinical tests is already under way in the United States, China and Italy, and the use of chlorochemine used earlier for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chlorochine.
The Uhani Institute of Virusology recommends a daily dose in one gram, but notes that dose dose doubled is very dangerous and can lead to fatal outcomes.
On 28 March 2020, FDA granted authorization for the emergency use of hydroxychlorochine and chlorochine at the discretion of doctors treating patients from COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of fishery are needed to infiltrate SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxandide was recommended for a detailed study in vivo by showing that SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited in low concentrations. Research showed that the SARS-CoV-2 proteuse of trans-member serial 2 (TMPRSS2) needed to be reconciled through interaction with the receptor ACE2.
Research on the use of chlorochine and hydroxychlorochine with or without azitromicine has severe limitations that prevent the medical community from using these treatments without further study.
A hypercytokienemy may arise as a complication at later stages of heavy COVID19 form.
There is evidence of the fact that hydroxychlorochine can be a hypercytokienemia, and a small study by China ' s National Health Commission has included tocialisumab in the recommendations for the treatment of the crownuvirus.
This drug has been released to 2 stages of a non-randomized test, which is carried out at the national level in Italy, after positive results have been obtained from patients with a severe form of disease.
In conjunction with a blood serum analysis on pertin to detect cytokin drills, it is intended to counter the factors that are believed to be the cause of death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA endorsed an antagonist of an interleikin-6 receptor on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the steroid refracter syndrome release syndrome caused by another cause, CAR T-cell therapy.
Today, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocylysumab is an effective means of treating the cytokin release syndrome.
The transfer of cleaned and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients recovered from COVID19 to those who need them is now considered a non-vaccinary method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in SARS patient treatment, but its results were unconvincing.
Neutralization of the virus is an expected effect by which passive anti-teel therapy can protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-telo-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, can be used.
Other forms of passive therapy by antitellars, for example, using monochlonal antibodies, are at the stage of development.
The use of reconnaissance serum can be increased, consisting of a liquid part of the blood of the healing patients and containing antibodies against the virus.
Crown-virus diseases, high-speed syndrome
Le Wennjan, a doctor at the Uhania Central Clinic, who later became infected and died from COVID-19 after reporting on the spread of the virus.
