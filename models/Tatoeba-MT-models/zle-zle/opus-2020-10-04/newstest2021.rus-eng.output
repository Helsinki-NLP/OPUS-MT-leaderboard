Semilarsky v. Prosecutor's Office: Cassation of the former Vice-Mer of Tartu will be reviewed on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided on in early September.
The Courts of the First Two Instances refused the Semilarsky claim, but in April his cassation appeal was filed by the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the complainant on 12 December 2019, as its authorization did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The court ruling stated that the complaint contained a claim for reparation for damages caused in criminal proceedings.
“Regulation of such matters must be done by the Prosecutor ' s Office and by the departmental court”, previously explained to the ERR correspondent to the Tartu Registrar Annet Kreittsmann.
She said that Walvo Cemilarski had appealed the judgement before the District Court, which had not changed the decision of the Court of First Instance on 5 February.
Now the Lord will have to say his word.
According to counsel Cemilarski, jury lawyer Oliver Nees, his client for about two years was unfoundedly suspicious of bribery.
He now demands that the Public Prosecutor's Office refute the unfaithful allegations and reimburse him moral harm.
The case of the prosecutor in the special cases of the Luna District Procurator Margus Gross, which he made in October 2017, when Semilarsky, together with the other Vice-Mer of Tartu Artem Savorov, was arrested at that time on suspicion of several crimes.
"Remember that when I was detained, the Security Police and the Procuratorate immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential local authorities, were corrupt.
Those public suspicions that were hanging out in the air escorted me for about two years.
Now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the Prosecutor's Office doesn't want to say anything about it," commented Semilarsky in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the Prosecutor ' s Office should operate.
"The assertion of bribes and corruption has proved to be false, but it's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly emphasized in its rulings on Russia and Lithuania that, at the investigation stage, the representatives of the State should be careful in the selection of words that suspects would not be represented as criminals before the sentence was handed down.
The Procurator's Office also requires a presumption of innocence, which unfortunately has not been respected in this case against Walvo Semilarsky," said Nees.
“The public submission of Semilarsky as a serious offender and a bribe in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being clarified is inadmissible, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfairly towards the complainant,” added counsel.
According to rus.err.ee, the former Vice-Mera Tartu Walvo Semilarsky will not be held accountable for the charge of bribery - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is judged on charges of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in a particularly large scale transaction.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the Urban Court in the decision-making of companies operating in Tartu whose owners or leaders had been actively engaged in personal contact at an extra-employed time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarska had personal interests, and he had to withdraw from the decision-making process.
Earlier, as wrote rus.err.ee, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office had suspiciously suspected of obtaining a bribe and violating anti-corruption law in a particularly large deal.
This occurred in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
At that time, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office and the Security Police stated that there were substantial evidence against both Vice-Meres.
The two officials were then resigned.
The Suvorova case later reached a court that had fully justified the policy.
The trial in the Walvo Semilarsky case is still under way.
The “Ruki Up” team ex-solver visited the Tvers region

Perhaps the singer rests with his family in the beautiful city of Tver.
The residents of the region have already thanked the performer for the visit, as well as expressed their hopes for the meeting and personal association.

And most fans remain behind the old version, "Sergey, old version of the song, you're clear 1,000,000 times better!
Support me with the loyal "Rooky Up" fans, "We don't need a new baby."

How the CB's decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Russian Bank expects again to lower the key rate.
It dropped by another 0.25 per cent, to 4.25 per cent of the annual, a formal regular historical minimum.
The regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic when he returns a short drop in the rate, as well as the tone of the CB statements and the updated projections on the Russian economy.
This means that the current monetary policy mitigation cycle can soon be stopped.
“We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, primarily given that the risk of inflation is still below 4 per cent in 2021,” reported the head of the Russian Bank, Elvira Nabiullin.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiollinoe, will take over a year and a half.
It noted, however, that, following the lifting of the restrictions on the pandemic, economic processes were renewed: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, the construction and production of consumer goods increased, and the annual slowdown in transport and production.
According to the CB projection, in 2020, the economy was reduced by 4.5.5 per cent (this expected to be 4-6 per cent) and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 was 3.5-4.5 per cent, and 2.5 to 3.5 per cent in 2022.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil prices projection to $38 and 40 per Urals barrel in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The CB had previously expected $27 and $35 for the barrel.
Finally, the inflation bank projection for 2020 was 3.7 to 4.2 per cent against the previous expectations of 3.8 to 4.8 per cent.
The view of the Russian Bank on the economic situation becomes more optimistic, which draws us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, considers economicists for Russia and the CIS Renaissance Capital Safia Donets and Andrey Melatzenko.
Thus, the Russian Bank has consistently lowered the key rate more than a year, and has dropped by 3.5 percent since the beginning of last summer.
At the last meeting in June, the CB had reduced it to one percentage point, owing to the low rate of inflation due to depressed demand and the need to stimulate a slow-down economy due to the pandemic and its related constraints.
The pre-deployment of the monetary policy continues (at the next meeting of 18 September and before the end of the year), but the limit is near, the Chief Analyst of Rosbanka, Evgeny Kochelev, agrees.
Aggregate inflationary risks also indicate the proximity of a gap in the mitigation of interest policies - broken supply chains, possible cost increases due to the prevention of the epidemic and faster (as compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he said.
The follow-up of the Bank of Russia will require greater attention to inflation during the harvest season and to the external volatility of geopolitical conflicts.
In one way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to further reductions in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as possibly on the mortgage, says Maxim Petronević ' s economist of the analytical bank ' s opening.
The adjustment of the rates would be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarified.
Needs rates may fall by 0.3 to 0.6 per cent for the second half of the year, mortgage rates may be completed at 6.2 to 7 per cent, and the BKS Prime Economist Anton Catovic is not excluded.
In his view, the average contribution rates would also fall - they could drop to 4.2-4.5 per cent in the coming months (now barely above 4.5 per cent).
They can then go down to 4 per cent if the CB decreases the key autumn rate, it is thought to be Paktović.

Question: The Governing Union of Peasants and Green of Lithuania once again led the party rating
The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, headed by the ruling Simeon Coalition, led the party rating.
This was shown by a survey conducted by Vilmorus Sociological Research Company to order a newspaper Lietuvos ritas.

The third is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 per cent of respondents are now ready to vote.

Submodoskya authorities reported the fate of closed landfills
Solid domestic waste polygons continue to be closed in the Ground.
This year, the authorities are promised to eliminate the last.
Some of the 39 landfills are modernized into modern garbage-processing facilities.
But it's not possible for every polygon, many of them grow up in a dense housing structure.
After the polygon is closed, it rises to recovery - the polygon's body is overwhelmed by soils, mounted degazing systems and dismantling infiltrates.
This prevents chemical processes inside the dump from igniting, bleeding, poisoning soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to be raised with a useless bunch of stones in the midst of the vicinity of its residential building.
Why don't you make something useful?
For example, in Ruse, where the regeneration of Annino's polygon ended literally in the days, the authorities are considering an option to make a bunch of mining slopes.
The site, which has been operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown to the extent that it has gone beyond the land allocated to it.
Therefore, the recovery had to buy neighboring sites that de facto had long been killed by garbage.
"Some time will pass, the polygon will sit down, we'll get to the fortress, and we'll think what we can do to make it a good start.
The head of the Russian district, Nicolas Parfenov, told the journalists.
Two polygons will be renewable energy sites
The Torbeevo Policies in Luverts and Timohovo in Bogotown District will become sites for renewable sources of energy from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, a gas power plant will be launched in Torbeeva, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hour electricity and about 0.95 hygacalories of the heat energy, which will provide for its own polygon needs, the heating of administrative and productive facilities.
Timohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt hours and continue its work as a garbage processing complex.

Beautiful high-minares only adorned Aya Sofia
Once again about Aya Sofia, the O. Vladimir Zelinski had to protest.
First, there was a free entrance, hurrah!
I wasn't in Istanbul, but God's house is better for free entrance than paying.
Secondly, the Muslims have conquered the land as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Okan, the Muslim Caucasus (and placed the Church in Grozno) and planted apples on Mars.
God's help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Earth.
The Americans have conquered the Americans.
Are we going to get everyone back?
Do you think there will be no Gentiles who will have to return their cape where the Tenth Church is located?
Thirdly, the Muslims have improved the building and invested in it.
I mean, they're just like plants and rooms that Lenin's taken from the bourgeans in their property belong to Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the Anguara, so they're all on the right of progressors.
Beautiful high-minaretes have been very adorned by Aya-Sofia, very much.
There was a stupid nun, a stupid nun with beautiful minerals.
Fourthly, there are no “Islamic” and “rightful” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanges that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in civilization does not think.
That's the thinking of the British MiDA Thoynby, a believer who's embarrassed to think that way.
And to the believers there is a place of prayer everywhere.
And always.
He who believes does not pray except from where he is asked to leave. He leaves and prays therein.
But he is a believer, and he is not a defender.
We're vomits, not stones.

"It seems to me that this is a story of the power and general aspects of human life.
It's nothing to do with LGBT and feminism," said the actor who played the father of a boy who was dressed in women's clothes.
He stressed that he was “haughty of work” and did not consider it to be propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he was frightened by some people's reaction to the serial line: for example, there was a case where "a man in his deep hull shot a dimmed area and said that it was all wrong."
"Then, a couple of cases were when we met the dissatisfied local people who didn't understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so people who first came with claims began to help us," he summoned.
The shooting incident, explaining the publication, took place in September 2019 in Kabardino Balkaria: a drunken man attacked a gunshot vehicle and was detained by police officers.
Previously, it was reported that Olga Barants, a public commissioner for the protection of the family, had filed a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomádor with a service of more.tv, which hosted the Russian Chica series.

The ombudsman was also disappointed that “the series gave a lot of attention to homosexual sexual orientation” of a minor.
