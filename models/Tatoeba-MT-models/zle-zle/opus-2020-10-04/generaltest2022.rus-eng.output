From my point of view, the literature programme was formed by the Balzakov aged ladies on the basis of their interests.
From the 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilsky and Volconsky.
They wrote the Billetristics, of course, from the point of view of the most balsakov-age ladies.
And the psychology and the torment of Tolstoy and Turgenev heroin are not so interesting for teenagers.
Adolescents are rarely interested in heroe psychology.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Germany: Fourth vaccination from the coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
The expert believes that the current vaccination in Germany will not become final but will continue with a new force.
Despite an active privative campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be sufficient for full protection.
The director of the Association of Physicians of Common Practice, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This is reported on Saturday, December 11, by Die Welt.
“We expect the fourth vaccination to take place in the summer, at the latest in the autumn,” the expert considers.
In addition, Wygeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be carried out “combined with influenza vaccination”.
This will help to achieve best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help to combat the spread of the new coronavirus strain Omicrone.
The new option is particularly dangerous.
For example, the probability of recontinuing Omicron is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta.
This is illustrated by a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
On this basis, the BioNTech/Pfech manufacturers are planning to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
Companies stress that two doses of vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against contamination by the new version of Omicrone coronavirus.
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer revealed that the effectiveness of the vaccine in two doses is significantly lower: “neutralization potential is reduced by more than 25 times”.
“This indicates that two BNT162b2 doses do not provide sufficient protection against omecrone-stalm infection”, stressed BioNTech and Pfizer.
That's why a third dose is needed.
Experts insist on accelerating the rate of vaccination in the country.
For example, the President of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates a reduction in the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, the accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the Delta Virus and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“Israel’s experience is very convincing,” the expert stressed.
Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
Bet-A-Vib is a special branch of Bet-A's family from Pontoon21®.
It (as and the Kalikana Vib series) is different from the many other vibes in what was originally created to account for the use of idle fishermen, not just for fishing.
These vibes are larger than those of closest analogies, a united weight, which is undoubtedly a positive impact on the nuances of these interesting baits.
Another feature identified is the top slippers of a strong and tight plastic, creating additional vibrations at vertical and horizontal wires.
As a winter vibe, the bet-A-Vib catches a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most catchable is simple monotonal animation, i.e. the movement of the detacher up and down almost without the pause.
When planning a deviation from a vertical axle, it is not very large, which is convenient for fishing in a limited area overwhelmed by underwater vegetation, cortex and other obstacles for which the trailer is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant in the winter fishing of a vessel and a large window, especially in the middle of winter, when a precision and aggressive bait is required.
Bet-A-Vib reaches the extreme point of the trajectory, immediately turns and returns to the reference vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is no less successful in the winter catching of the pond trout.
To please its riptures, you can choose from two modifications: a noise capsule (NS - NanoSound) or without it (SL - Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib has the potential to jeopardize a passive cheek that does not even react to a liver.
In catching the Bet-A-Vib, it demonstrates the distance and accuracy.
It is understood and not caprized, well combined with the leaf and woven cords of even large diameter.
For the fishing of the cheek, vessel, erche or glass, except equally relevant, and “strap”, sometimes with “chirkany” at the bottom.
If you catch in dense places, you can change the front troin to a double, which would reduce the probability of ceilings.
Among the baits of their class Bet-A-Vib are the most sustainable and, as a result, one of the most catchable.
With the same success, both relatively small and relatively deep sites can be used.
All models are equipped with cream owner ST-36.

In Libya, 7,000 Russian mercenaries were declared
Libya has over 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner (PWC).
This was stated on Sunday, 12 December, by the President of the Supreme Council of the Republic, Haled al-Mishri.
“In Libya, there are now over 7,000 PMC mercenaries, Wagner.”
They also have aircraft.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Cupra.
They have 30 jet aircraft on Gardabiya airplane (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte)”, quotes Anadolu agency.
Haled al-Mishri also indicated that Russian mercenaries “try to capture” the central part of Libya, from Chad to the Mediterranean, after bringing their people to power” in the Central African Republic.
Maintain the presence
According to the interviewer, Moscow was looking for the country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “relocated in Libya”.
The Vagner has been in Libya since 2019, using airbase and port in Sirte, as well as the Jufra airbase, notes the Agency ' s publication.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else the mercenaries can be
According to the agency, Wagner is expected to operate in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training to local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Vagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licences for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the delivery of weapons, technology and military services to those countries,” said the article.
According to the media, the Guards allegedly fought in Donbassa, Syria, Mozambique, the Sudan and the CAR.
This group is not meant by the forces or by the Jurlys registry, and its fighters are not included in the wording lists of the personnel.
This company is sanctioned by the United States.
Recall that the 27 EU countries had previously approved the Vagner Results.
This decision is expected to be adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme Council of State of Libya de facto is the second House of Parliament with advisory functions with the dominant Islamists, writes TASS.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the election of parliamentarians and Heads of State from 24 December to at least February 2022.
“Before elections, fewer than two weeks are left, and the chances that they will pass in time are steadily declining,” the material states.
On this occasion, the Libyan High Electoral Commission postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates for an indefinite period, transmits the Sky News Assembly telecommunal.
External policy by Russian eyes
38 per cent of Russians see more success in the country's foreign policy than failures, 29 per cent believe that failures prevail.
"According successes, in Syria, have protected, restored the world there," the decision on "North Flow-2", "the whole world has been scared that cool weapons," "We've been waiting."
The main failures are “Conflict with Ukraine”, “Confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from peace”, as stated in the Foundation’s study “Public opinion”.
The Government of Dubai has completely renounced paperwork - all the public services have also become digital
The Government of Dubai reported a total renunciation of paperwork and the digital transition.
All public services will also be provided only electronically.
This is reported by the WAM Emirate Information Agency.
“This day marked the beginning of a new phase of digitalization of all aspects of the life of Dubai -- we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government,” stated on Saturday, the Prince Emirate, President of the Executive Council of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed Ben Rashid Al McTum.
Internal and external documentation in all Dubai State institutions will now be implemented only in digital form through special information platforms.
The introduction had touched all the industry without exception: health, MCH, police, municipal authorities, courts, etc., many commercial structures have also joined the Government initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalization of documents started in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, the authorities have estimated that 336 million paper sheets have been saved, representing 14 million hours of human work and $353.8 million of cash equivalents.
Previously, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, stated that electronic services save citizens two days a year.

The production and export of Turkish vehicles fell below the 2020 level
The production and export of Turkish cars declined dramatically in November against the background of lira depreciation.
As a result, the industry ' s 11-month performance was worse than last year ' s results, reports Bloomberg, referring to data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 vehicles were released in Turkey, 20 per cent less than a year earlier.
About 75,9,000 cars were shipped to export, more than 25 per cent falling to last year.
And if, following the first 10 months of this year, the Turkish road sector showed a positive momentum by the past year, the production of cars was already 0.3 per cent worse than last year, after 11 months of 2021.
The erosion of the Turkish lira was caused by a sharp erosion of 29 per cent on the dollar in November.
This has led to a fall in economic activity in all sectors.
Over 500 IAS entities received deferral on credit payments in 2021
The First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov reported on the situation of grants for small and medium-sized businesses, handing over to MIA correspondent “Kazinnform”.
“On the information of the Agency for Financial Market Management and Development, this year, pursuant to the request of the Head of State of 1 April 2021 of the Agency ' s President ' s Order No. 127 of 9 April 2021, “On approval of the order for deferral of loans of small and medium-sized business entities”, Alihan Smail wrote in response to the request for delegates.
He recalled that the arrangements for deferral of loan payments were for banks and microfinance organizations to defer credit payments issued to IAS entities, including IUs, prior to 1 April 2021, between 1 April and 30 June 2021.
The term of deferral was between 30 and 90 days on the choice of the IAS entity.
The statement of the borrower may indicate a different period of deferral of payments.
During the deferral period, claims and claims were suspended, notice of the need to settle outstanding debts, as well as the charges of the creditor of commissions and other payments,” noted the competitor.
In 2021 the second-level banks received applications for the deferral of 603 IAS borrowers, of which 553 IAS entities were deferred to 9.7 billion tenge.
In the IFO, 131 IAS entities have submitted applications for deferral, of which 95 persons with a value of 105.8 million tenge have been deferred,” A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Purasev suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the strain of the Okmiron.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity could carry it easier than those with a strong protective reaction
Pulmonologist Sergei Purasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "ocmiron" might prove dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the condition of the virus.
Scientists believe that the “ocmiron” originated in the body of HIV-infected or immunodeficiency sufferers.
I mean, in mutation, he did not encounter any resistance against immunity.
That's why he's more aggressive.
With no immunity response, he became very quick.
Apparently, there's those spikes of protein, the sips, maybe more than laid, their antibodies have not been cut down during the mutations, and the pulmonologist Sergei Purácev commentes.
The doctor suggested that people with weak immunity could carry the “ocmiron” easier than those with a strong protective reaction.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
That's how it happens in pneumococcusing infections, when 30-year-olds die, and 60-year-olds are cheeks.
And the immune answer of the young man is perfectly inappropriate, and wherever there was only a threat of a finger, he beats like a gun on the throats, and has concluded Sergei Purasev.
The doctor also recalled that the coronavirus had dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them was pneumonia.
Bacterial and viral sprays occur.
If the first treatment is very successful and fast, in the second case, only symptoms - all the hope in the body can be purchased.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the beginning of the body's intoxication - temperature, weakness, failure.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficult breathing, top in the throat, cough.
Abdominal pains on the right or on the left can also indicate a growing problem.
In the meantime, the vaccination of a 12 - to 18 - year - old generation can begin in Russia until the end of the year.
Virusologist, director of the IFTI Genomic Engineering Laboratory, Paul Volczczov noted that this category is severely affected by the codied.
Adolescents who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
It's the most socially active protein, like the tutors of the kindergartens, said "Mosque 24," Paul Volczczov, a virusologist, leader of the IFTI genomic engineering laboratory.

Immunologists have suggested why people with obesity are victims of cavity
The authors studied the fats left behind by barial operations and found that fat cells known as Adipocytes could be infected with crownvirus.
Immune cells located in grim tissue have also been infected, with a strong inflammatory reaction.
Scientists have also studied the fats of the patients who died of the codied and have discovered the coronavirus particles in fat surrounding the various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in attempts to avoid the response of the immune system.
It's likely that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of doing that.
A biologist described the reasons for dementia.
The biological science candidate, Simeon Goloshakien, described the reasons for the imposition of dementia and described the ways in which it could be prevented in an interview with radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is shown by the progressive loss of cognitive functions - in time, the person is hardly guided even in a familiar environment.
Goloshakien noted that dementia are the most common causes of neurogene-generative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolical disorders and a shortage of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of disease development.
These include hypertonia, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, the role of social isolation and the lack of active cognitive activities could be played," he said.
Destructive habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep abuse and low-motivation - also affect the development of dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted the indifference, the inability to concentrate and the decline in the level of abstract thinking.
“The debate is that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it,” adds a biologist.
In order to prevent the occurrence of the disease, WHO recommends that the necessary level of fissile be maintained, cognitive skills and skills requiring memory and logic.

Egypt returned some 30,000 illegal artifacts from the country
Over the past 10 years, the Government of Cairo has been able to return some 30,000 artifacts that have been smuggled out of the country illegally.
This was reported on Saturday, 11 December, at the television station Al-Hayat, the Chief Inspector of the Department of Returns of the Ministry of Tourism and the Ages of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian State has been able to recover 29,300 artifacts.
Only this year has 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization been discovered in the Bible Museum in Washington," he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all smuggled artifacts were registered in the archives.
The departmental staff are now working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, specialists “were tracking global auctions and Internet sales” through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The Chief Inspector stated that upon return cultural values were re-established and then placed in museums.
He said that one of the restored artifacts had been found in Belgium by an ancient skeleton, which was now part of the exhibition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities requested Interpol to help find the London auction of Pharaoh Tutanghamon.
The Auction House of Christie's held trades on 4 July, where the lust was sold for over 3,000 years for 5.97 million (about 680 million roubles).
This caused resentment on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also asserts that art was illegally removed from the Karak temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutanghamon, depicted in the image of the sun - god Amon, had been kept in a private collection and had not been traded since 1985.
How the relics got into Europe is unknown.
Egypt has actively sought in recent years to repatriate illegally smuggled ancient monuments.
According to the authorities, 95 per cent of smuggled ancients are the result of archaeological discoveries of black miners.
“Crim Tatars are not taken into account” - and this is right, because the Crimean Tatars (232,000) are a people of self-sustainment (about Turks).
If you would like to add, only 42,000 people live in the city of Rome.
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
Only the Turkic language group joins them.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to staff mobile devices
Credit Suisse requires its staff to provide the bank with access to their personal mobile devices, Financial Times.
The case is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss Bank does not issue corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount for the acquisition of a mobile phone or a smartphone from a telecommunications operator partner.
Under existing rules, the bank may review information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to deal with business issues with colleagues or clients.
The Bank enjoys the right to verify mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if a staff member used it to meet with a client who has not been approved by the Credit Suisse.
Now, after many staff members have moved to remote jobs, the bank wishes to extend the rule to all devices used to deal with working issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank ' s management has set a deadline for staff to learn about the new rule.
Officially, the information on the new requirement is not commented on in Credit Suisse.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Esenin's life, 1925, was fruitful in creativity, but the hardest for the world's poet and his ego.
He's already out of any literary associations, he's sprayed with imaginism, he's himself, but he's known, he's demanded, sometimes he's bitterly critics, even malicious, but the reader's ready to carry it on his hands.
Over a year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them -- real masterpieces, the Persidian motivation cycle -- written by the poem Anna Snegine, published 8 books, the “Russ of Soviets” compendium.
And the main success was at the end of June 25 of the year, the President concluded with Esenin a treaty to issue his essays in volume 3.
None of Sergei of Alexandrović's modern poet's honor, he's the first!
In addition, it made very good money — a contracted fee was $1,000 a month for 20 months (for example, a factory director received 300 roubles per month, an engineer 200).
That year's funds were needed more than ever.
Esenin married a granddaughter named Lyva Tolstoy Sophie Tolsta, who had to care for family life, support the sisters of Kathu and Sasha, as well as the mother.
Life would seem to be happy, but it is mostly painted in the dark tone, as if materialized a nightmare from the poem "The Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill.
I don't know where this pain came from.
Is the Wind Whistling?
Over the empty and lonely fields,
It's how we grow in September.
Alcohol swells in your brain.
Many acquaintances pointed out that Esenine had a severe, bad appearance, obviously sick.
There's more and more neural cycles, more nerve breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis is alcoholism, Sergei Alexandrović is someone and has been treated, no reliable documents are left.
For example, May 1923, when Esenin was the fourth wife’s insistence, the Americans of Aysedora Duncan corrected the health of the Paris clinic at Professor Peter Hannuskin (once Esenin will fall two years later in Moscow).
And here's evidence of poetry, scandals on this ground, leading to the militia is slacked by tens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrifying poet's novel with green snake has evolved rapidly.
At the end of the summer of 1923, Esenin settled for a short time with a friend named Ivan Startz.
Surprisingly, Esenin, with his very good income, never had his home in Moscow or in Peter, found himself in rented apartments, hotels, or acquaintances.
The old people remember:
“It was only during the night and, in most cases, in an uninhabitable, drunken state.
One day when Esenin came back at four o'clock in the morning, he fell on the stairwell...
Falling, she scratched her face and whispered.
When he came in a little bit, he began to cough, splashing the whole sheet with blood..."
And Esenin himself, after the European and U.S. warrior (in the United States, there was a dry law, but Duncan took on a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
"I didn't see anything there except the cabs and the streets...
I'm at the end of the day, and I've stopped remembering people...
Well, and drinking, of course...
And I was drinking because I was so sad."

Matras Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom 100x195
Promtex-Orient Duet Latex Econom is the modern implementation of the budget model in the Prize Line.
The base of the mattress is a block of independent double springs of Duet.
Inside a large spring, a softer spring of small size is inserted.
This allows for the uniform distribution of the load on the mattress.
On two sides, the mattress is supplemented by an artificial latex.
It's like a natural latex, but it's more dense and less expensive.
The flexibility and volatility of this material increases the comfortable effect of the mattress.
The artificial latex of hypoallergenic, it doesn't absorb moisture and dust.
Matrace is well suited to a couple with a big difference in weight (out of 30 pounds).
With the smart springs here, there's no wave effect when the light partner rolls on the side of the heavy one.
A nice, soft-minded joccard Sense will pass through the syntopon layer.
Natural tissue does not accumulate static electricity.
This mattress model may be constructed in a convoluted version (vacuum roll-package).

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms” against the EU
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Poland believes that Belarus uses migrants as “arms”
The Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Poland, Paul Yablonski, expressed the view that the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, used refugees as “arms” against the European Union and intended to return to such “operation” next year.
The relevant statement was made by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an interview by the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus were temporarily “resolved Lukashenko”, but he is“ actively seeking new ways”.
The Polish official is also convinced that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons “in many parts of the world”.
According to site kp.ru, the European Union had previously introduced the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
He touched 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, it was stated that it was willing to continue to expand restrictive measures against the Republic “unless the situation in the country improves”.
In response, Minsk introduced a food embargo on a wide list of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not on the Silk hat" when the oak jacket makes a man a joke
At the 2021 secular events, the occupants were dominated by obscurities.

Lamoda Ilja Wahoshkin, the Modern Expert, warns that in the case of the occupant jacket, it is not his model or faculty, but its appropriateness.

The “Great Semerka” warned Russia of “major consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine
Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, France and the United States have issued a statement following the Liverpool Heads ' Meeting.
It stresses that the Russian “war aggression” against Ukraine “will have enormous consequences and costly”, but that specific measures are not described in the document.
“We, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union are united in our condemnation of the strengthening of Russia's military power and the aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine,” says the statement.
The Ministers further call on Russia to “comfort the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations on transparency of military activities”, as President Baiden said during a video call to President RF Putin on 7 December.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in Normand to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements with a view to resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine”, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Greater Seventh.
Any use of force to change the borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have tremendous consequences and serious retaliation”, they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign State to determine its future.
We welcome the modest position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” is also stated in the statement.

Pfizer vaccination was found to be 32 times less efficient than omecrone-stam
The effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech versus omecrone-stal coronavirus is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
Researchers from the University of Hong Kong and the University of China of Hong Kong have come to this conclusion, transmitting South China Morning Post (SCMP).
Vaccination was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity among citizens who received two doses of a drug from COVID-19.
"We see that most people have a high level of anti-viral activity against the original version of Sars-CoV-2, but this capacity has been significantly reduced against omicron varieties," said Professor Malik Peyris.
In doing so, scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe flow of the disease in the form of coronavirus infection.
Previously, researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the influence of micronestam.
The authors of the study concluded that omicronesm could cause a new wave of circulation of the virus and increased mortality unless additional measures were taken.
Ukrainian Head of Mine Defence accused the FRF of blocking the supply of NATO weapons in Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine, Alexei Reznikov, accused the Government of former Chancellor of FRG Angels Mercel in blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kiev within NATO.
In an interview of the Financial Times, on 12 December, Reznikov recalled that Germany had committed a veto last month to the purchase of Ukrainian antisniper systems and rifles for the defeat of unmanned people.
It is noted, however, that Berlin later softened his position with regard to rifles and recognized them as non-death weapons.
According to the Minister of Defence, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons through bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the United States, Britain, Lithuania and France.
However, FT notes that the position of the new German Government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms transfers to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ambassador Andrew Melnik of Ukraine in Germany, expressed the view that Kiev should not wait for Berlin to supply arms to Cholce Chancellor.
He said that the previous FWG leadership had explained its refusal to place arms at the risk of the military escalation of the conflict in Donbassa, despite the “occupation by Russia” of parts of Ukrainian territory.
The same “unreasonable” position, as the diplomat is sure, will be preserved by Germany in the new Chancellor.
In August, the Ukrainian leader Vladimir Greensky stated that Kiev was awaiting assistance from Berlin in equipping the Navy.
In Ukraine, it is expected that Germany “will be a Ukrainian partner in a technical sense”, added the President.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the Co-Chair of the Green Party of FRF, Robert Habek, visited the Republic, where he spoke for the sale of the defence weapons of Kiev.

Developed ways of returning stolen money via the Internet
There are several ways to get the money stolen through the Internet and not to be a victim of fraud in the future.
They were opened by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Thus, in order to reduce the risk of major losses when the banking card is received, it is recommended that the main funds be kept on the map or on a bank account that is not used in online cheating.
Part of the savings can be deferred to the savings account and withdrawn as required.
Experts also recommend establishing a separate map for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in shops that did not use 3D Secure protective technology, you could start the recovery procedure.
“In the rules established by payment systems, on unauthorized transactions carried out without 3D Secure, liability is entrusted to the participant in the computation chain which does not use the service”, the representative of the Promsbank said.
The expert from the international payment provider, Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba, stressed that the buyer had the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent operation no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used a map on online resources that did not require two-factured authorization, the transaction could be challenged and repaid.
It is noted that, in some cases, the Internet stores themselves return the money to the client if the order has not yet been sent to the shipment.
On 19 November, a member of the Public Chamber, Director of the Liga of the Secure Internet, Ekaterin Mizulin, reported that 11,000 cases of fraud had been received in 2021 alone, ranging from the sale of forged documents to theft of personal data.
She said that the establishment of a single window for complaints against online fraud could be an effective solution under current circumstances.
The Sholz arrived in Poland to discuss the “Special Flow-2” and EU legislation
The newly elected Chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw for negotiations on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the strengthening of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline “North Flow-2”.
Although Scholz expressed his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations.
The Prime Minister of Poland, Matheuss Moravetski, stated that he would call on Scholz to take action against “North Flow-2”, where Russian gas is expected to be transported to Germany by way of Ukraine.
According to Moravetski, Russia can use gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
Germany, in turn, supported the efforts of Poland to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin stated that it would help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland by acknowledging that the judicial reforms carried out by the right party “Right and Justice” violate EU legislation.
Poland refused to pay a fine, and its supreme court ruled that national legislation had priority over the EU rules.
The new Government of Germany, which swore on the Wednesday, despite the demands of Poland and the United States, did not make public commitments to stop the work of the North Flow 2 in the case of Russia ' s invasion of Ukraine.
The U.S. officials stated to Congress that they had reached an understanding with Germany on the stopping of gas pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, reported on Tuesday to a high-level officer in the United States Congress.
The German officials did not confirm these communications, but Scholz, on Wednesday, warned of the consequences of Russia violating the border of Ukraine, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by the representatives of the “Big Seventh”.

Miniciphres want to give the writers to the residences.

“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for new-year, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other activities, which implies an increase in the turpotic,” noted Barros.
Previously, Brazilian authorities obliged non-crown tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
Opened full protection scheme from COVID-19
Virusologist, doctor of medical science, a Russian professor of science, Anatoly Altstein, in a conversation with Ura.ru, opened a plan for full protection against coronary infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
There is no injecting of a large number of immunoglobulins.
Immunoglobulins A protect the slippery shell, so the virus cannot penetrate the body.
And in the middle of the vaccination, we have most of the immunoglobulins G (antile).
And if you enter both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution for double vaccination yet," he said.
Sergei Tokarev, the chief preventive doctor of UrFO, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination in conjunction with injecting was the possibility of stopping being a COVID19 carrier.
He added that this would help to ensure that the protection of the organism is expected to be maximum.
Previously, the Minister of Health of the Low City region, David Melik-Husseinov, stated that the new COVID-19 pandemic would result in the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
He said that this is the case in other countries, where another wave of the pandemic came before.
Inna, um...
I've been talking to the cobel for a long time, if you're ready to change the warm house, the corrugated house, the favor, love, and the game to the bitch, you go ahead.
But the song was trained, and it was a smart one.
I picked my society and went home.
On the video, a 90% way of working.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I had many hosts to stop running behind the dog, even though they had to count out that 200,000 were running away, picking up the hand and driving to the other side.
In the end, "200,000" chose a master, not a dog who ran somewhere in there.
Bullying protests against vaccinations continue to occur in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators went to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and plans by the authorities to make vaccination from the militia compulsory.
Since February of the next year, unpredicted people will have to pay a fine of Euro3,600.
The Spanish, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, conducted a peace march in Madrid.
Some people held posters with the label "This is a false pandemic," "I'm not going to vaccinate."
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, the covid certificate is obliged to access bars, restaurants, sports rooms, old houses and night entertainment facilities.
Decision on the introduction of sanitary passports by the authorities in a number of regions of the country was made against the rise in the number of cases of coronavirus infections.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand manifestants protested against tightening restrictive measures and QR codes.
The act began peacefully, but then became a clash with the security forces of the order.
The group of demonstrators began throwing stones at the police.
The law enforcement officials responded by applying waterметs.

WHO has discovered “omicrones” in six dozen States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the new coronavirus strain of “omicrone” has already been identified in 63 countries.
Several experts have already said that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of proliferation was described in WHO's report.
According to the organization, the strain has already been detected in 63 countries as at 9 December, in all six WHO regions.
This has only become an active circulation since the end of November.
WHO is also concerned at the high rate in which a new version of the coronavirus is circulated.
WHO experts are concerned that new pre-status strains can be circumvented by the extent of the spread of the “delta” strains, but that the Indian version of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all absolute countries without exception.
Tedros Adhan Ghebreyes, Director-General of the World Health Organization, said that omicrones-stalm could have a significant impact on the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions have also been reached in Britain.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that the "omicron" will replace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of survivors in Britain alone will be about 1 million, and this is officially "omicron" in the Kingdom at this time, several hundred people, and an estimated 10,000 people.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the "omicron strain", and over 2,000 people will be transported to hospitals at peak every day.
The British health system will not be able to cope.
The situation is compounded by the fact that, according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower than the rest of the disease.
The reaction to the "omekron" by Russian Satellite V is not yet known, it will be understood in the next few weeks.
The Gamaley Center has just begun a Russian vaccine test on the "omicron strain".

The Russians warned of a new scheme of frauds.
The thieves began searching for new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
It's written on "Envestia" with reference to experts.
According to the product director Ivideon Zamur Abutalimov, the main danger associated with the distribution of video communications is the diplhei.
In this case, fraudulents are producing a fairy video based on actual records involving the victim.
This enables neuroséti to reproduce the specific characteristics of the conduct of a person.
Abutalimov added that using diplhey, abusers can call acquaintances on video contacts or create a video clip with a copy of a man for blackmailing.
"Such counterfeiting can easily provoke bulling, because a spoiled malicious person can place people in stupid, dangerous or compromising pseudo pseudocensors," said the expert.
The leading system engineer Varonis Alexander Wetcol, in turn, noted that psychological people have greater confidence when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks in the case of video technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I was buying all of this in a small town where the local mentality didn't let it paint much and walk in short skirts, show nodds and collisions on legs.
It's the province, but in the store it was like that.
In large cities and Muslim women were painted, and the slaps were shown.
That's the way in Dushanbe, this is the big city, the capital of the republic.
There's a lot of fashions, and there's no cosmetics.
Five actions to avoid sugar diabetes are listed
The problems with sugar levels in blood are among the most common in the world.
Some, however, do not attach great importance to this, and it is for nothing.
In time, sugar diabetes can lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive activities play a key role in preventing disease generation.
For example, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of diverse beverages and shifting to regular water have a positive effect on metabolism.
Sweet products increase blood sugar to a dangerous rate when used in excess.
So the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and keep them at home.
The disease is affected not only by malnutrition but also by habits.
To reduce the risks of sugar diabetes, there is a lot to move.
Experts recommend that low-carbon diet be maintained.
Such a diet not only helps to reduce weight but also protects you from sharp fluctuations in the level of sugar.
Many cells need to be eaten to protect against diabetes.
Food fibers fill their stomach and thus contribute to a sense of well - being, digestive juice, and increased meal.

Dr. Paulova told me about the "migrans of the weekend" in the workforce.
Several factors can lead to a deterioration in the weekend
The reason for the deterioration of self-employment after working days is often the “migrane of the weekend”, a well-known endocrineologist, a medical candidate, a senior researcher at the Faculty of Basic MICs, a scientific supervisor of the Zuhr Pavel System Medicine Clinic in his telegrams.
She said that it is particularly common for workers who suffer headaches, breakdowns, and weaknesses during weekends.
Dr. Paulva noted that in addition to a week’s accumulated fatigue, there are enough objective reasons for the body’s negative reaction to conditions.
On weekends, our lives are changing dramatically.
"Sleep for a long time, all day lying on the couch, probably eating more, and drinking less, the doctor reasoned.
Because of overeating and water shortages, it is heavy and broken down.”
A further role has been played by a late recovery.
So if you get up three hours later, you'll have a reaction called jetlag.
It comes from travelers who cross several time belts.
To determine which of the factors is crucial to deteriorating self - feelings, Paul recommended that we examine what is the most important change in weekends.

Scientists in South Africa stated that Pfizer's vaccine against omicron was poor.
In South Africa, Pfizer's vaccine against omicron was deficient.
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported on the low effectiveness of the Pfeder vaccine against omecronestum coronaviral infection.
It is estimated that it (the level of omicron neutralization) corresponds to (the level) of vaccine effectiveness of 22.5 per cent against symptom infections, which... denies the ability of the vaccine to protect against infection, says the study published on the MedRxiv portal.
However, the experts clarified that a drug could save from the severe current of the disease.
Previously, in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, it was projected that omecrone-stal coronavirus could cause a new wave of pandemic with more frequent hospitalization in Britain than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in the usual products?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in diet can lead to type two diabetes, as well as to cardiovascular and hecological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that a hidden sugar - ingredient similar to the calorie, composition and glycomic index may be identified by an unknown word in the product.
Several tens of names, in fact, representing sugar, can be presented on the label.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fruitоз.
Other raw sugars, such as dextrosis (sugar derived from maize), leuulose (fruct sugar), meassa (black potack), ciropa agava, etc., may also be found.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and dysacarides, and they can be not only in conduit products, but also in ketchup, in doctoral colbasa, bread, etc.
According to Roskatchy, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to use whole and rough products, as well as to draw attention to the label and many different names of sugar.
Different kinds of sugar varied by taste, but whatever the ingredient of a product - syrup or nectar, processed or rough, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the number of sugars specified by the producer in the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc., initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar may be considerably higher than the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose importance for the FRF 25 years later
The new Chancellor of FRF, Olaf Scholz, stated that the import of gas was losing importance for Germany, as the country continued to move towards decarbonization of the economy.
He said that by 2045 Germany was planning to completely renounce gas, oil and coal, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, 25 years later, the world will be so that the question of transport of gas to the FWG and Europe will play another role," said the Chancellor.
Shaltz noted that Germany remained committed to Ukraine ' s transport of Russian natural gas in the future, since it was now important for energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States had made a statement that recorded support from Berlin for the energy transformation of Ukraine.
Previously, the head of the German Ministry, Annalena Berbok, stated that the gas pipeline certification process “North-2 flow” was continuing.
According to the Minister, the Coalition Negotiations and the discussion of the Coalition Treaty had stated that European energy law should be applied to energy projects.
The Diploma also indicated that the pipeline “is not yet in conformity with the requirements” of the European Union.

Hackers hacked Twitter by the Prime Minister of India
The hackers hacked the Twitter window of the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.
The thieves have been able to publish a fairy message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized the Bitkoin as a legitimate payment fund and that the country had already purchased the criterion.
Modi's office has been asked to ignore new messages.
The Prime Representatives stated that Twitter had responded quickly - access to the account was restored.
The page of India’s Prime Minister was already broken in 2020 and called for contributions to the fund through cryptization.
At the referendum in New Caledonia, most voted against independence
In New Caledonia, the third referendum held on 12 December ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, 12 December, on noon, the majority of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in that third ballot was significantly lower than in the previous two ballots.
According to the preliminary results published by the local authorities, “for” the independence of New Caledonia from France was 3.51 per cent (2,755) voted, while 96.49 per cent (75,762) voted against.
Apparently 43.90%, more than 80,000 New Caledonia residents participated in the elections.
As the interim results of the France-Presse Agency commented, “the outcome of these elections did not leave any room for doubt”, since the advocates of independence called on the voters not to vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago impeded a full and fair pre-election campaign.
This non-participation thus opened the way for the third victory of French New Caledonia, following the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7 per cent of the population voted against independence, and 53.3 per cent were 2020.
According to separatists, they do not recognize the last ballot and challenge it to the United Nations.
As reported on Sunday, 12 December, in the Al-Elisé Palace, President Emmanuel McRon, of France, should address the outcome of the referendum.
The topic of the independence of New Caledonia has greatly revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates expressed their favour for the Territory to remain in France as “the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific Ocean”.
“New Caledonia must necessarily remain French,” repeated Eric Zemmour.
The same statement was made by the candidate for the Republicans of Valerie Pecres, who, at the end of October, published a column in Le Figaro, calling on the Kaledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel McRon announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the President added, “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia”.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed “a strong desire that the choice of the Kaledonians be the choice of France”.

At the end of Hartwell, western countries called for a “one front against Russia”.
The readers of WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"In this article, there's quite a lot of false information," gives Newsti an comment by one of the readers.
"Europe is not ours to lose it," and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine," said another.

The magnetud 5.2 earthquake occurred in the Kuril Islands region
The magnetud 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Szicotan Kuil Island.
It is noted that the earthquake epicenter was 231.8 kilometres north-east of the city of North Kurilsk.
The hole was 92.5 kilometres deep.
Previously, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnetud earthquake in Peru, which affected ten people.

Ukraine will start producing new-generation reactive drones.
In the new Turkish and Ukrainian plant, jet and unmanned aircraft (BPLA) type ANKA will be launched.
On 11 December, an outside adviser to the head of the office of President Alexei Arestović of Ukraine reported this.
That is, they are capable of acting against air facilities, against other unmanned aircraft.
Even against the aviation piloted.
The Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish airline: the corpus and the like," quotes his Dialogue.ua.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA equipment, Arestović said that it was jet, not powdered BPAs.
He said it was a new generation of drones after Bayraktar that surpassed it in all its characteristics.
The first batch of the BPA is to be produced by the factory at the end of the next year, and Arestović has been concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was established by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the pilot has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
On the previous day, Ukrainian headquarters secreted data on the use of Bayraktar and Javelin missiles during the military operations of the Joint Forces in Donbassa.
On 6 December, the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greensky, reported that the construction of a factory for the manufacture of modern military unmanned pilots had begun in the country.
He said that Ukraine intended to use drones.
On 29 September, Bayraktar Savunma and Ukrainian mine defences entered into an agreement on construction in the Kiev area of a centre to train staff, as well as testing and maintenance of Turkish BPLA Bayraktar.
The office of the Ukrainian leader's press service called this memoranda “a big real step forward.”
Two lions escaped at the airport.
The lions escaped at Changy Airport in Singapore.
This is reported in The Straits Times.
Two predators were able to get out of a container with seven lions coming on one of the planes.
The publication notes that it remains unknown from which countries they were brought to Singapore and where they were being sent.
One of the runaway lions ran away on the roof of the container.
The beasts couldn't get away from him because of a close-up net.
Opposition ended after arriving at Mandai Wildlife Group, known for all Singapore Zoos.
They deprived the lions by wires with a tranquilizer and plan to bring them to a quarantine institution.
Previously, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion had escaped from the owner and had walked the streets of the city.
On the same day, the beast voluntarily returned home, and the people did not suffer.
Specialists warned of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research shows that surplus of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was warned by the publication Daily Express.
Experts believe that there is strong evidence that people who do not suffer from folic acid shortages are less at risk of some cancers, such as coloric.
However, surpassing the necessary dose in contrast contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
Professor of the University of Alabama in Birmingham, dietologist Beth Kitchin recommends that the number of folic acids consumed during the day be monitored.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The threat of cancer is only increased if it is significantly deviated from the figure in a large or smaller direction.
Kitzyn recommends that no vitamin B9 be accepted in pills without a doctor's advice, that it be necessary to monitor the docking and avoid milk and other foods containing folio acid.
Rachel Fain used to refer to Folio acid as a substance that slows down ageing.
As it is, among other things, in avocado, Fain recommended that men, after 50 years of age, eat this fruit more frequently.
In Britain, some 75,000 people may die by April because of omecrone-stam.
The projections of British scientists show that the spread of omicron-stale cronavirus in the next five months in England may cause to die up to 75,000 people unless the winter restrictive measures are tightened.
This was reported in The Guardian, with reference to the study of experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), by TASS.
According to the most optimistic projection of experts who are part of the scientific and advisory group on emergency situations at the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022, at least 25,000 fatalities are reported in the country due to the omicron strain, while some 175,000 patients will be hospitalized.
The hospital will receive more than 2,000 infected patients every day at the peak of the disease.
“Severe measures to combat coronavirus may be necessary to prevent the overload of the National Health Service if omicron is more contagious than a delta option, and existing vaccines cannot exclude infection,” said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
The British Health Security Agency has previously informed that, if the omecrone-stalm rate persists at the current level, about 1 million cases will be detected in the country by the end of the year.
By mid-December, however, omicrine strains could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At present, 1,898 omecrones have been found in Britain, of which 633 have been identified for the last day.
At the same time, on 9 December, the head of the British Minsdrava, Sajid Javid, indicated that the figure could already be 10,000.

World demand for super-they grew by a quarter.
Construction of super-height this year and orders for the next year are hit by world record, despite calls for reducing hydrocarbon footprints and combating climate change.
In the world ship registry, the number of boats ordered was 1,200, a quarter more than last year.
In the era of combating the effects of climate change on greenhouse gas emissions, it is difficult to imagine that the number of people who have desires and money for a 50 million pounds and above will not decrease, says Guardian.
However, they are growing.
This year 25 per cent of the ships were ordered more than in the previous year.
Brokers say that this was not 20 years old on the market.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht fear contamination on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on their own ship.
The second reason is also for the coronavirus.
If all these people used to go to the office and meet with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them are working away and negotiations are held on a zuma basis.
Broker Will Christy told the newspaper that the shipyards are ordering new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that the customers are willing to pay more, only their yacht would be ready for at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and super-poor people could afford it," he says.
In Western society, many criticize the wealthy and call it decadant.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space, yacht life or flights on their own planes, the elites are frustrating in society because they do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with all other humankind.
Economists call upon Governments to act and propose new taxes and rules for the super-poor, although they realize that such money mobility will be extremely difficult to do so.
However, only the number of super-heyth orders, but also their characteristics, is impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a length of sterns above 100 metres.
The Norwegian billionaire Recque builds a REV Ocean boat with a length of 183 meters.
After you're down to the water, it'll be the largest boat in the world.
The boat has a “son pool” on the boat, as well as a submarine designed to study sea depths.
The existing super-theatas have traditional helicopter sites, open-heavens cinemas, and on some of them, such as the McGregor's Yachte, a platform for unity.
But it's symbolic, given that multimillionaires in the world are a little over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of the use of a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the thousands of times as high as the average of the planet’s average population.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the largest pollutant of the planet, Roman Abrahamović, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases falling into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two thirds of the emission trail were hijacked on his Eclipse yacht with a length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner is not on the boat, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and command to shove the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superehite owners do not harass other people ' s sympathy when they, like the most wealthy woman in Australia, Jena Ryanhard, who owns mines on the continent, complains through Yutub that their giant ships do not have room for docking.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build a marin for vessels 50 metres away.
Hazardous weekly dose of alcohol leading to the development of intestine cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol drinks a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is written in the Daily Express publication.
Experts concluded that the use of four or more drinks per week is linked to an increased risk of cancer.
At the same time, the likelihood of the development of the disease increases with the increase in the number of alcohol used.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of intestine cancer than women.
Scientists cannot determine the precise reason for the development of this type of cancer, noting only that certain factors lead to a detrimental process.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or more precisely all dog lovers, are convinced that these creatures are very smart.
But they don't even know how much four - legged vegetators are actually developed.
For many years biologists have conducted various experiments to undoubtedly learn how to develop intelligence in animals.
Although the vocabulary of the dog is not as extensive as human, the new study proves that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The work of scientists was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs can't play chess or make poems, they don't make any sense in politics, economy and art, while often they can fool their masters.
Representatives of some species, believe experts, show the best results in understanding human language words, but statistics for accurate findings are not yet sufficient.
For example, some species are traditionally considered as dog genius, such as labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and that they do not give up their two-year-olds ’ ability to learn.

In Ukraine, the U.S. and Russia were prepared for trade
The United States and Russia will “trade” on the entry of Ukraine to NATO, analyst Alexander Cochetko, in their article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his view, Washington and Moscow were soon planning to continue negotiations on United States safeguards that Ukraine would not enter the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Baiden on the right of countries “to enter anywhere”.
If you're being offered something definitely inappropriate, for example, selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to trade, but just send the offerer.
In the case of Ukraine, a trade is scheduled," wrote the analyst.
Cochatkov added that Russia was not planning to attack Ukraine but was seeking dialogue with Kiev.
“The preparations are carried out in secret, quickly and immediately to take offensive action, not waiting for the group to detect and deploy the force of opposition,” he noted.
China is catalysing the development of the railway industry
Chinese advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries in the China International Real Transport and Equipment Exhibition, 2021, held in the city of Zhuzhou of Hunan Province/Central China.
The main technologies developed by CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. have enabled trains to automatically identify and detect technical malfunctions.
High-speed trains on the railway line of China Laos, which was introduced into operation at the beginning of this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure the reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
In the past six months, China has significantly increased the exports of railway vehicles and many Asian and European countries are witnessing China speed.
In May this year, CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd departed from the production line of CRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., the first two-story ambulances developed in China to export to Europe.
At a maximum speed of 200 kilometres per hour, these trains will be travelling along the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, a test train of the subway developed by the aforementioned company for Turkey began to be operated.
The train will travel through a subway linking the centre of Istanbul to the city airport.
The subway movement will be opened next year.
This will be the fastest line of the subway in Turkey at 120 kilometres per hour.
“The China Industry for Railway Equipment is one of the highest levels of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaozian, head of the Department of Commerce and Investment of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade (CCDMT).
“This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-grade equipment production in the world market,” said Fen Jaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, with a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system for the production of railway equipment, with a full range of support tools and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoxian, the country ranks first by level of electrification of railways and by operation on high-speed and urban railways.
A biologist listed the early signs of dementation
The candidate for biological sciences, Simeon Goloshakien, in an interview with radio Sputnik, listed the early signs of dementation.
He said that the signs of future dementia could be indifference, as well as a number of moderate cognitive violations, such as inability to concentrate, planning, abstract thinking reduction.
Discussion is under way that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor, said the expert.
Goloshakien stressed that the causes of dementia may be neurogene-generative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolical disorders, lack of defined vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and atherosclerosis of brain receptacles are the most common causes of this syndrome.
Biologist noted that to date medical professionals do not know how to deal with dementia effectively.
It must therefore be prevented in a timely manner.
He said that learning foreign languages and active communication would help reduce the risk of dementia development.
WHO also recommends that moderate physical loads be maintained, cognitive skills be regularly trained through games and hobbies that require intensive integration of memory and the logic of thinking
“There are recommendations for the application of the various BADs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still discussed in the scientific community,” said Goloshakien.
“The World Health Organization recommends the maintenance of moderate physical loads, regular cognitive skills and skills through games and hobbies that require intensive integration of memory and the logic of thinking,” said Goloshakien.
Previously, a charitable dementia research organization in Britain stated that the disease is increasingly affected by people aged 40.
Medical doctors called early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease.
The first alarming sign is the problems of vision, which makes the patient difficult to recognize objects.
Another sign of a developing flaw was the aphasia - a state where a person could not find the right words to convey what he wanted to say.
Neurologist asked Saakashvili for treatment abroad
The former President of Georgia, Michael Saakashvili, needs psychoner treatment and rehabilitation abroad, stated to journalists, Otar Toidze, who are part of a medical constituency established at the Georgian ombudsman.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is the leading cause of his illness.
The static challenges are the problems of movement, coordination, variability of character," said the expert, noting that this is not beyond the normative framework and that the ex-President must now be sent to special rehabilitation.
“This is what we call neurorealization and psychoner rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia,” said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution not found in Georgia.
In the evening of 7 December, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after the prison staff had disciplinaryly punished him.
Georgian policies quickly lifted the punishment and restored themselves to their former rights.

In Spain, protests were made against COVID-passports
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia, protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate were carried out, transmitting the Europa Press Agency.
In the Catalan capital, the number of share participants was approximately 3,000.
In Barcelona COVID, passports have become compulsory for bars, restaurants, sports rooms, old houses and night entertainment facilities.
Many manifestans have come to an action without masks.
They accused the State of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, passports for vaccination will also be required to enter entertainment facilities and restaurants with more than 50 persons.
Protesters in the city reported a medical dictatorship, and vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of cronavirus infection have been detected since the beginning of the pandemic, and over 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for non-vaccinated persons.
On 12 November, the Government introduced legislation on a single system of QR codes.
The Russians are expected to be able to visit mass events, cultural institutions, food and retail facilities, with either a vaccination certificate or a trans-traffic certificate or a vaccination nurse.
The same rules will be established for trains and aircraft.

Rapid rise: how Chinese become skiers
Olympics should attract millions of people on the slopes and help to establish international resorts in the country
In China, it is hoped that Olympics will not only involve 300 million citizens in winter sports, which will allow President Si Jinpin to gather 1 trillion Yuan, but also contribute to economic development of the remote provinces.
The mining resort of Taiwan in Zhangziakou, near the Winter Olympic Games, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greenhouse works are also being carried out: the trees are planted by workers.
There are more than 700 mining resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to accept international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including in Zhangziakou, there are snow problems.
The main challenge for a long-term perspective is to provide comfortable and interesting recreation on Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become all over the world.
But it's still a long way before.
The Advisor for Games Justin Downs said that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry had changed to ignorance.
Every year, more Chinese are on the slopes of the winter.
Fiona, a Beijing snobber, one of them.
Despite serious changes, it will take many years to create a mining culture here, says Downs.
Many resorts are in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions are still to be actively developed and built up the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
The 70-year-old Gao Makong lives in Chunley, near the Winter Olympic Games.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom of winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, from Beijing to Chunley, no local resident was suffering without work.
There is an increasing number of shops selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes, the common drink points are opened with national kitchen dishes.
There's even a COVID-19 testing station on Taiwan.
China seeks to create a prosperous winter sports industry, its athletes must be the leaders of major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach the world level.
More than 500 million people in the world can face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, stated at WHO
More than 500 million people in the world can be brought to extreme poverty because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has hampered the progress of mankind in universal access to health services, stated in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB).
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Services, on 12 December, WHO and WB published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to medical malfunctions and had caused excessive volatility in health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, population coverage has declined, and tuberculosis and malaria have increased.
At WHO and the UB, it was stressed that the pandemic had caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, so it was harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation causes more than 500 million people “to extreme poverty, because they have to pay for these services from their pockets”.
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stated that the coronavirus pandemic had turned more than 100 million people into poverty, and more than four billion people had virtually no social support.

Reuters: The Thai Minister has been dismissed from broadcasting at the "Sammit for Democracy" at the request of the White House
The presentation by the Minister of Digital Technology of Taiwan, Audrey Tan, at a panel discussion during the U.S. organized Summite for Democracy was translated into non-video mode, is evidenced by the footage of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, with reference to sources, claims that the picture was disconnected at the request of the White House.
They were reported to have been responsible for a map on which Taiwan was selected in a separate colour from the CIS, which considered the island to be its territory.
The map shown by Mrs. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was marked green as free, and the DPRK, Laos and Viet Nam are red as closed.
After the Minister showed the map, the picture was replaced by a screenshot, noting that the views of the panellists “do not necessarily express the position of the United States Government”.
The CPD was not invited to the Sammit for Democracy.
Reuters noted that the map shown by the Minister of Taiwan could be contrary to the one-China policy of Washington.
One of the sources of the agency stated that, following the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council had aggravated the State party by accusing him of showing Taiwan to a separate country.
The Council for Democracy, organized by Washington, D.C., took place from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the zero day of the Nobel Peace Prize Summit, Dmitry Muratov, chief editor of the New Gazette, called for the establishment of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption was given to charity.
Earlier today, the Deputy Secretary of Sowbeza RF, Yury Averyanov, stated that the summit was “antirosy and anti-China charge”.

In the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services, a “healthy conclusion” between Russia and the United States
Sergei Ryabkov, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in an interview with "Isvestim", evaluated the prospects for Moscow and Washington's relationship.
He noted that the long way of interaction had led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries had not begun yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, and, as part of some prospect of improving relations, it is all unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long path that we have made to both the current administration and the Trump and Obama.
The problems did not begin yesterday," said the diplomat.
According to Ryabkov, problems are related to the US's desire to impose Russian approaches on multiple issues.
The LID subscribers added that they would not risk giving optimistic predictions on the prospects for improving relations and would not expect Washington ' s position to change.
He explained that, except for areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, there was no progress.
In doing so, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in international security matters and hopes that the signals will be heard and that Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Previously, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, at a meeting with American Secretary Anthony Blinken, said that Moscow was ready to resume a dialogue with the United States.
Virusologist warned of the risk of vaccination by a no-curricular drug from COVID
COVID-19 vaccines with a nasal vaccine may have allergies and need medical help, so the first locations for the drug should not be organized at airports and trade centres.
This was reported by TASS a virusologist, a member of RAN Correspondent, the bionanotechnology, microbiology and virusologies of the Newsibir State University, Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to organize vaccination points at airports and shopping centers, but I'd only do it in the first time in the health facilities.
The fact is that the probability of allergic reactions to such a vaccine is low, but it is desirable that the person then sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of anti-alergic drugs that operate literally in a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary," said Netesov.
According to a virusologist, vaccination in trade centres can be considered when experience in the use of a drug is gained.
He also stressed that it was important for the nasal vaccine to fall on a slippery shell in the nose.
It is likely, however, that the vaccine will not reach the destination location if the nose prize is leaked after injection.

Previously, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in pessimistic forecasts, found that April in England could cause 75,000 deaths due to the outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the omicron strain.
Sands warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
President Dmitry Peskov, Spokesman for President RF, commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in the event of the continuation of “aggressive action” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “intervention” on the territory of the country.
"Some restrictions on the introduction of the Russian Federation and not on the suffering of itself, it is impossible," said the official representative of Cremlin in the air of the Telecommunication "Rossia".
The sand says it's "remembering everything in the world."
It was previously reported that the United States considered the imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in the field of energy as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union are planning to introduce restrictions to complicate the conversion of dollars to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank, Herman Greff, is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonia residents rejected the idea of independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on 12 December by the French BFM.TV telescope.
96.5 per cent of those voted against independence.
3.51 per cent of the inhabitants of the South Pacific archipelago have maintained independence from France.
Results of 2.99 per cent of ballots were cancelled.
The level of participation in the vote on that day was very low: some 55 per cent of the archipelago residents attended the plots.
In the view of the experts, the low phenomena was due to the call by separatists for refusal to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to carry the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the New Caledonians protested their independence from France at the referendum.
A referendum on independence was already held in the region in 2018.
Most residents supported the presence of an archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is nearly 20,000 miles [20,000 km] from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
Some 270,000 people live in the archipelago, and the Territory has a special administrative and territorial status.
There is an agreement between Paris and New Caledonia Administration in 1998 that the region may organize a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO preconditionly considers the “omekron” less dangerous than the “delta”
The World Health Organization (WHO) preconditionly believes that the “omekron” is less dangerous than the delta-stal coronavirus.
However, there are data on vaccine efficiency reductions in the new COVID19 option.
According to information on 9 December, the “omicrone” has been registered in 63 countries.
The “preliminary data and the significantly modified antigen protein profile of the omicron strain” suggest that the vaccine against infection and the transfer of the option is less effective.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it (“the seriousness of the disease” is aред.) may be less severe than in “delivery”, as stated in the WHO technical report.
The organization notes that all reported cases of omicron infections in the EU have been easily or unsymptomally flown.
However, the new strain is preliminarily spreading faster than the Delta.
Two cases of omecrone-stalm infection have been recorded in Russia.
They were "formerly immunized," reported the Gamalei Center.
The head of Rossemort Anna Popewa stated that no reliable data had yet been available that the new version of the coronavirus was less dangerous than the rest.

In Ukraine, we called four scenarios for Green
Ex-deputate of the Supreme Council of Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the President of Ukraine, Vladimir Greensky, in 2022.
In his view, the Head of State could remain unsupported by the West, as well as perhaps compromises on Donbas.
On Sunday, December 12, Denisenko reported on this in the Glavred portal.
The first option, which Denisenko called “the ideal storm”, implied that Ukraine would cease to support key western countries by reaching an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"Paralleally, there is a decline in the prices of key goods that we traditionally export, " ...> internal protests and opposition of power to key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. -- Red.) " , added an ex-parlamentary.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation, “war against all”.
This projection will take place in the event of high turbulence in world policies, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this situation, the Ukrainian leadership could compromise on Donbas, which could lead to a conflict within the country.
At the end of the summer, Green position will be weakened, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former Nardep, is between 50 and 55 per cent.
The third option of Ukrainian policy is the opposition of the Green People ' s and President ' s Groups, which is likely to take control of the force block and to carry out the “polulist initiatives”.
During such a crisis, Greensky will begin the “reformation of power”, adding Denisenko.
Another scenario is the conversion of the Greenian to the "Father of the Nation".
This could result in an event that would be a major shock to society.
“Act must be broad enough to cause reactions from external partners and to increase support for Ukraine,” said Denisenko.
This option is possible as a result of the disaster, the technological catastrophe or the aggressive actions of the Russian Federation.
The Russian side has, however, repeatedly rejected any probabilities of “accidents” to Ukraine.
In Moscow, it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the US that increased military activity within Russian borders.
Previously, on 11 November, the Rateing Sociological Group survey showed that the Ukrainian President's rating had fallen to a record low of 19.3 per cent.
This has been the lowest since the election of its Head of State.
Analysts had projected the situation in which, in the event of the upcoming elections of the President of Ukraine for the Greensk, only 21.8 per cent had voted, while the former President of Peter Poroshenko had 14.5 per cent.
However, only 19.3 per cent of the President ' s support was expressed among all interviewed.

Arrested for an action on the Red Square, a poet, "Eutushenco quotes 10 days, this is the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
The student of the WSE was detained in the Red Square with a poster with a Hashteg #Poetrossi greater than the poet.
This quote belongs to the writer Eugenia Eutushenko.
Alexander had developed an administrative report on the refraction of public action.
The first time he was arrested on January 23, in Pushkina Square, at a meeting in support of Alexey Naval.
"The purpose was to draw attention to poetry as a whole, and now, unfortunately, interest in it has been lost to the fall of a culture common in Russia, and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this Hashteg," explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to elaborate on the messession of his message.
How did police officers treat you this time and before?
What were you asking in the department, how was your share commented?
This time, staff were more correct, maximum detention, polite, as if it were not funny in some context.
The Pushkins were taken by the OMON and took rigidly.
They asked standardly, about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked if it wasn't nice, it was understandable.
Except for the four sides of the monkey, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what was going on.
And if they start writing their poems after this hashtag, at least a few people, I'm not going to spend 10 days.

Researchers described how potatoes help fight age disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and microelements that contribute to the improvement of cholesterol and blood.
B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, fishoflavin, folic and pantotenic acids are found in root fetus.
All these elements help to operate the systems of the organism.
Potatoes also help to combat age violations.
Because of its large content, it is useful for the stomach and cotton, and it can also help to prevent hypertonia and atherosclerosis in regular use.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root fruit is better to be cleaned or cooked than to burn on oil.
Previously The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous to diabetics, like other products with a high glyquemic indicator.
These are foods containing hydrocarbons that are quickly fissile on sugar, such as sugar, sweet, unalcoholic drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the Commersant ' s newspaper warned of the possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction in its production in personal aid and the increase in reprocessing capacity.
In the view of market participants, only imports will be able to absorb product deficits at this time.

Estonian scientists will look for life in Venus
The Massachusetts Technology Institute, in cooperation with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, prepares three space missions to Venus to find signs of life in the atmosphere, reported on Sunday, “Actual Chamber”.
The purpose of the five-year missions is to assess the fitness of the clouds of Venus and then to search for life there.
For the project, TART scholars offered tools for measuring acidity and oxygen in Venus clouds.
So far it was assumed that the clouds of Venus, nearby to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist there, but probably originally Venus was a planet of the earth.
A test from Venus must arrive during the third mission.
Let's assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it looks like an earthly one or whether it's different.
If it is very similar, then it will be obvious that earth’s life did not begin on earth.
If it's different, it's probably more likely that life is born on Earth," said the leader of the Estonian team of the "Venus Life Finder" project, Mikkel Pousalau.

Metal Alled to Change Russian Business
The theme of the metabolites became popular in the autumn of this year, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook to Meta.
For the market, this event has become an important signal: the largest player has confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction among people.
So the business in Russia, as in the world, will invest in the creation of its own meta-environed and its subsequent coining.
The meta-full should be seen as the continuation of objective trends.
On the one hand, the tendency to develop remote interactions in pandemic conditions was tired of division and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the interest of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.

British economist could not predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill couldn't predict 2022 because he thought that this would be a failure.
He wrote about this in an article for the Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that the next year will be unpredictable and any trend may change.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and the second is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increases were temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic it was clear that “the world of infinite generosity of central banks had already survived” and that it was time to return to relationships where interest rates based on inflation would correlate with the expected GDP growth rate.
O'Neill noted that, in the background of the pandemic, the continuation of superfluous economic policies may, in the view of some experts, lead to a new inflationary outbursts.
In addition, attention should be drawn to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the rise in poverty and climate change, as summarized by O'Neill.
Mikhail Schulgin, head of the Global Research Division, Opening the Investment, had previously reported that the positive expectations of the dollar for 2022 remained, with the potential for growth being less significant.
Among the risks to the Shulgin dollar, it referred to the monetary policy of the FDC, the trends in oil prices and the fears of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to agree.
But one thing is glad that if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago, the containers were less than that.

Russians gave approximately 4.5 per cent of the country ' s GDP to motor vehicles
As a result of the 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on new cars, 28 per cent more than during the same period last year's statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion roubles) was spent by the State to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
In September last, President Vladimir Putin, at the meeting of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, said that this amount was more than 4.5 per cent of the country ' s domestic gross product (GDP) in 2020.
Income from the Russian market leads the Korean brand of Kia.
In 10 months this year, he was able to carry 325.7 billion roubles, almost 24 per cent more than a year earlier.
Hyundai ' s native Kia mark has an increase of more than 35 per cent, and car sales are estimated at 279.3 billion roubles.
In leading positions, this brand and the average weighting price of the car - Hyundai has grown almost 21 per cent in a year, to 1.94 million roubles - the stronger travel trend was only in Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
However, the sales of Korean brands have not increased significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of Autoproducers of the Association of European Business in Russia, Kia has achieved 9.4 per cent more in the same period than a year before.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
A three-month-long rouble of sales leaders, Japanese Toyota, spent 275.5 billion roubles for 10 months, 14 per cent more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with 266.1 billion roubles (+75 per cent) - the German brande prize increased by 37 per cent and the average weight of the car (at 28 per cent, to 8.2 million roubles).
"The Mercedes-Benz also has a good increase in sales and a high average price -- more than the BMW -- from this and the higher growth in the financial capacity -- explained by the NAPI genitor Tatiana Arabaji.
In terms of growth in sales, phantastic indicators show Chinese brands, also significantly increasing financial capacity this year.”
The Russian Lada shows the average marketing (plus 28 per cent), and the Russians spent 229.4 billion roubles for 10 months.
At last year ' s financial capacity levels, there are companies whose sales of cars fell in stock in 2021, including Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
The UAZ, and at a very low point, spent 12 billion roubles in 10 months on the extra-roads and peaks of this mark, compared to 12.4 billion roubles a year earlier.
In the background of the problems with the supply of autocomponents and disruptions in the production of all of the world ' s cars, automobile companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same “AutoWAS” increased the cost of Lada models seven times per year, the latest journey (8-10,000 roubles) took place at the end of November.
Regularly copy prices to their products and other autoproducers.
The volume of the Russian road market in monetary terms will continue to increase, in addition to the deficit of machines, to inflation, as well as the desire for autoconcerting to rescind past losses, the experts believe.
With a deficit of cars, I think that many cars have even been able to transfer partly to the consumer the costs of past periods that they couldn't put in the price of cars before,
says VTB Capital on Vladimir Buffalo.
I believe that financially, autoproducers feel very good now, supporting the high marginality of sales."
This is the indirect indicator of the growth in the cost of cars that have been observed during 2021, and the price of new machines is increasing faster than inflation, and the expert makes clear.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but largely through inflation and complexity in the design of the machine itself, predicts Buffalo.
With the increase in supply, price increases will be limited.
In the monetary expression, the Russian author will continue to grow in the next year, even if the cost of vehicles is slower, autoproducers will be able to obtain their income from volumes, notes the independent consultant for the autoproduct of Sergei Burgazliev.
In view of increased demand and insufficient supply, autoproducers are now seeking the greatest profit from each sold car, notes Burgasliy. -
The production of cars is not expected to increase at least in the next six months, with the insecurity of citizens in Russia being heated in the future.
In the background of the traffic situation in the market, it was a good investment facility -- the purchased year ago, even with a run, could now be sold more expensive than the original value, and the expert notes.
Baiden spoke of the transfer of military US to Ukraine in the case of Russia's invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered the sending of American military to Ukraine in the case of Russia ' s invasion.
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Baiden.
"Never had any such plans," said the White House head, answering the journalist's question as to whether the United States had abandoned that idea.
Baiden noted that in the event of escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia would face economic consequences.
He stressed, however, that the US and NATO had no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of unilateral use of American troops for Ukraine ' s defence was not on the agenda.
Baiden explained that if Russia invaded Ukraine, the US would move forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Estonia, Estonia, Latvia, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Hungary).
"We have to send more American and Nato troops to the eastern flank, B9 all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect them against any attack by Russia," said Baiden.
Previously, the Spokesman of the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, stressed that Moscow lacked intentions to invade Ukraine.
He pointed out, however, that Moscow saw a problem in the use of Kiev by Turkey ' s drons, as well as in the fact that “American arms are approaching our territory”.
