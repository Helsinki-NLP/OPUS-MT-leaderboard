The members of the Wales Assembly are concerned that they will “associate with mappets”
Some CHAs are terrified by the recommendation to change the title of their post to “MWP of Parliament of Wales”.
This recommendation was made because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
THE time of all the political spectrum is concerned that it can provoke ridicule.
One choir from the Laborists claimed that his group was worried about the rums of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in the Wales, "twp" means "unhelpful" and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
PAR, from the Wales Party, stated that his group as a whole was “unsatisfied ” and offered an alternative.
One of the Welsh conservatives said that his group was “unbiased ” about the change of title, but noted that MWP could quickly become a“ mappet. ”
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation w is similar to the yorkshire English pronunciation “u. ”
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “Assessing the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be accepted by the members themselves.”
The Wales Self - Control Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales received wide support.
As to how to call CH, the Commission proposes to call them "the members of the Parliament of Wales", that is, the WMP, but the MWP has received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CH offers alternatives, but trying to reach agreement can cause the problems of presiding Eline Jones, who is to submit a bill of change for a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, including rules for the exclusion of the CH and the structure of the committee system.
PAR will hold a final vote on its new name when discussing legislation.
The Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum to change the country name
On Sunday, the voters vote on whether to change the country’s name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
Voting was organized to resolve a long - term controversy with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens have long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim in Greece, and they have repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum to change the title, stated that he would ignore the vote.
But the advocates of the referendum, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, argue that change of name is just the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Marten's bells keep quiet because the Churches of Harlem are in difficult times.
"Old people I've talked to say that before there was a bar and a church in every corner," says Mr. Adams.
Now there's no one like that."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood as:
“Now people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the local living room they regularly come in.”
As for churches, Adams fears that money from asset sales will not be as long as expected by leaders, and “before or later they will end up where they started. ”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by condominium houses, and there would be people who would not help the sanctuaries who remained nearby.
“ The vast majority of people buying condominiums in these houses will be white, ” explained Adams, “so this will accelerate the day when all these churches will be closed, for it is unlikely that most of those who move to condominiums will become their adherents. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was constructed in 1870, and Saint Marten was built ten years after it.
The Native White Methodist Community left in the 1930s.
A black community that held rituals nearby had the right to own a building.
Saint Marten went to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retail merchants on the 125th Street, the main Harlem Trade Street, and these merchants didn't want to accept blacks and raise them in the service.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but the parishioners wanted to rebuild it and set it up a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson's father in St. Martén, proudly called a carillon “poor dills”.
The expert who played a carillion in July called it a “cultural treasure” and a“indispensable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillion in the world to play black musician Dionysio A. Linde, who moved 18 years ago to a larger carillion in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, in St. Martén, he had no replacements.
What's happening in Saint Marten over the last few months is a complicated story about architects and contractors, some of which were involved by the leaders of the church, others by the bishops.
The Council, the governing body of the parish, made up of peace leaders, wrote in July that it was concerned that the eparchy would “try to transfer expenses” to the council, but that the council did not participate in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the episode.
Some parishioners complained that there was no transparency on the part of the eparchy.
Acula traumatized a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California.
According to officials, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and traumatized him, and the boy was diving for lobsters in California on the day he opened the lobster season.
The attack took place almost at 7: 00 a.m. at the Beach of Bikon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that the morning of Saturday he had been diving with his friends when he heard that the boy was crying for help, and along with a group came to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought that it was just a fascination about a caught lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten."
As soon as he got to the boy, he found that his key was completely undone.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, "A shark in the water," added Hammel.
The boy was taken to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where he's in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
The captain of Larry Jails on the media Briefing said that a few weeks ago, there was a shark in this area, but it was determined that it did not refer to dangerous shark species.
Jails added that the victim had suffered traumatic damage to the upper part of the body.
In an investigation and security effort, the authorities closed 48 hours of access to the beach from the Ponto Beach in Casabladi to Saami in Encinitas.
Jails noted that over 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to British Cosmetics Market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams using cosmetics islands like those in the townships.
In the context of the increased entry into the British cosmetics market of £2.8 billion (increasing at the time that the sales of clothing and household goods are going down), the increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 shops throughout the country, and next year, if the idea is successful, the islands will appear in other shops.
The investments in cosmetics are that supermarkets are looking for ways of using the ethical space that was used under television, microwave furnaces, and household goods.
In Sainsbury's it was stated that they would double cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including the first brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be brand zones like those in Boots shops.
The supermarket also updates the assortimation of the Boutique cosmetics: most of the items presented will not be protested against animals that are increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the Fragrence Shop retailer protests his trays in two Sainsbury's stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, northern London, last week, and the second will be opened in Selli Oak, Burmingham, later this year.
The Internet show and the move to the purchase of small foods every day in small shops makes supermarkets do extra effort to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their shops would become more like umbrella, because the supermarket network is trying to resist the Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's are opening the Argos branches in hundreds of their shops, and there are also a number of Habitats, and Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago, and they argue that this has increased the sale of food products, and it has made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to upgrade cosmetics and pharmaceutical products to the supermarket was a failure.
Sainsbury's co-operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a controversy about how to share the income from the apt in supermarkets.
The new strategy emerged after Sainsbury's sold their pharmic business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an extended luxury brand for skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury, stated: “We have changed the appearance of our cosmetics islands to make the atmosphere more enjoyable for customers.
We also invested in specially trained consultants who would be able to provide advice.
The brands we have presented are called for to meet any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which constitutes competition for an old way of buying.”
Peter Jones “retreated” because Holly Willowby came out of an agreement worth £11 million.
The dragon League Star, Peter Jones “Development” because the Television Leader Holly Willowby has come out of his lifetime brand (the value of the contract is £11 million) to focus on new Marks & Spencer and ITV contracts
Willowby doesn't have time for a brand of home clothing and appliances Truly.
The couple's business was tied to Goop Guinet Peltrow's brand.
The 37-year-old leader of this Morning announced its entrance to Instagram.
Holly Willowby led Peter Jones to the Fragrance Star when, at the last moment, they had come out of their lucrative business of goods for life to focus on new convenience contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones is “disturbed” when a golden girl from the TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at Jones' headquarters in Marlou, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth 1.5 million pounds sterling mean that she doesn't have enough time to devote it to their joint home clothing brand and to the Truly accessaries.
This business was linked to the brand of Goop Guinet Peltrou and was to double the wealth of Willowby, which is estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willowie reported to Instagram coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his rest buildings.
The source said: “Truly was no doubt Holly’s main priority.
It was to be a long - term future for the next few decades.
Willowby’s decision to quit business shocked all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost before the launch.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a full store of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that this Morning, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could cost the firm millions because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and domestic clothing) and create further delays.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of the three children, Willowby, and her husband, Dan Boldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cappe, for ten years.
Willowby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple held feasts together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the Boldoin TV company.
Willowby will be ambassador of M&S brand and replace Anthony McParlin as leader I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source near Jones said last night, “We're not going to comment on his business.”
A violent conversation, "and then we fell in love."
He was joking about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that someone would consider “non-presidential” and for a very positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
“ Why did President Trump make such a big move? ”
said the Trump, simulating the voice of the news conductor.
I didn't make any mistakes."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denucleiization talks went into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, a leading diplomat in North Korea, Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “responsible response” from the United States for its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to maintain pressure sanctions.
The Trump was much more optimistic when he gave a talk in his rally.
“ We have a good relationship with North Korea, ” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
Now we have such a beautiful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of rocket testing, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American military personnel home.
He also defended his unusual approach when talking about Kim’s relationships.
“It is so easy to conduct ourselves in Presidential, but instead of 10,000 people on the street who are trying to get into this battle of the stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroyed an island that killed hundreds of people
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombo, foreign nongovernmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboki population have suffered, the national catastrophe has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“ In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult, ” said Ms. Sumbung.
While "Save the Children" is collecting a team to travel to Palu until it is not known whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a national disaster management agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the anger of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters are constructed, but they are not unique to other coasts.
The apparent absence of a Syrian warning about the tsunamis in Palu, although warnings were likely to contribute to death.
To move between a multitude of Indonesian islands is not just in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship in Lombock to treat earthquake victims sails to Pala, but it can reach the site of the new disaster at least three days later.
President Joco Widodo has made Indonesia’s infrastructure better the basis of his election campaign and increased the cost of roads and railroads.
But the funding deficit created problems for Mr. Joco's administration, who is planning to re-engineer in the next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by the long interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machete, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

Cromwell's Statue near Parliament becomes a new monument that will be affected by the "Rewritten History"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for destruction in the Taliban style of many cultural and religious artifacts of England, which his fanatic papyrate followers carried out.
But Cromwell's Community called Mr. Crick's offer “foolishness ” and“ attempts to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmite, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, the fact that Oliver Cromwell’s statue at Westminster Palace was inevitable.”
Economy during English civil wars was not carried out either by Cromwell or by his command.
Likely, Cromwell will be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of Crombel's sculptor William Hamo Thorneukroft is a witness to the moods of the 19th century and a part of the history of the figure that many believe is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmouth told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people are probably more likely at the end of the 19th century than now consider the Cromwell to be the Protector of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of monarchy.
Whether such an idea is accurate is the subject of the historical debate that persists.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the prominent figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievements as Lord of the Protector should also be celebrated and honored.”

Residues of Hurricane Rosa will bring massive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa was projected to be weakened by moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the nearest days, Rosa will bring rain with vegetation to the north of Mexico and southwest of the United States.
Rosa had a wind of 137 kilometres per hour (this is Hurricane Category 1) on the 5th morning of the east on Sunday and was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Evgeny, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, when the Pacific begins to form a tinnitus that moves east to the western coast of the United States, when on Monday, Rosa approaches the lower California peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it starts pushing strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will offer up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the nearest days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the nearby coal, will produce strong rains in the southwest.
In this area, from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams, and the possibility of drifting in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will result in an increase in precipitation by 5 to 7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in an important area of Arizona.
Flood floods are possible when conditions deteriorate rapidly because of the dispersed nature of tropical rains.
We are urged not to go to the desert on foot, for tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons storming rivers, and storms will bring in broken winds and dust storms.
Approximation of taxes will cause high rains in some parts of California’s northern coast.
The precipitation rate can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause heavy garbage flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and morning on Monday, and the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will become more extensive.
The heavy rain will go over the Fore-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, temperatures may become intense throughout the United States, as the Arctic becomes colder, but tropics remain warm enough.
At times, this leads to a sharp change in temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, we will see an excellent example of a sharp temperature shift in the central United States.
It's almost a 7-grade difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and DeMonnes, Iowa.
During the next few days, summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in the major area of the center and the east of the United States, the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperature.
According to our long - term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people were watching the Bretta Kavano case
On Thursday, over 20 million people in six television networks were watching the stirring testimony of a candidate for the Supreme Court of Bretta Kavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, which was allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
The political opposition continued, the channels interrupted scheduled programs to report the last news of Friday: the agreement prepared by Senator Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a one-week investigation into the charge.
Ford informed the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent confident that Cavano had polished her and tried to take her out of her at a party at high school.
Kavano, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent confident that this was not the case.
It's probably over 20.4 million people were watching this on Friday, reported by the research company Nielsen.
The company calculated CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Could not get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people watching TV in the office.
For a comparison, it's like an audience who watches a play-off game or an Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose thinking showers strongly supported Kavano's assignment, was the leader of all the channels during the hearing that lasted all day, with an average of 5.69 million audiences, observed in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million spectators, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
This moderate republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavano, and then on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras were captured as the protesters shouted at Flake when he was trying to go to an elevator to hear the Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, and he was cursed, which was broadcast in a direct air at the CNN.
“ I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have power, and a multitude of women are powerless."
Flake reported that his office had issued a statement and had added that he would say more to the committee before closing the elevator.
All cables and broad - speaking channels were broadcast for hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the extension of the Cavano candidate for the full Senate.
Flake said he'd do it only if he knew that the FBI was a charge against the candidate next week, which demands a democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced to talk to his friend, the democrat senator Chris Kunes.
After talking to Kunes and then with several Senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake’s choice was influential, since it was evident that the Republicans would not have votes to appoint the Cavano candidate without investigation.
The President Trump initiated the FBI investigation of charges against Cavano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses critics of political games around Brexit
In an interview of Sunday Times, Prime Minister Tereza Mei accused critics of her plans on the way out of the European Union in the political games with the future of Britain and insulting national interests.
On September 29, 2018, U.S. Prime Minister Teresa May arrived at a conference of the Conservative Party in Burmingham, Britain.
In another interview that came up with Tereza's interview on the first page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister of her government, Boris Johnson, criticized her so-called Chekers' plan on Brexit, stating that the British and EU were offering the mice to each other “absolutely absurdly”.

Volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The dust that is thrown out of Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost parts of Mexico.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday encouraged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since the crater began to act and recorded 183 gas emissions and ashes in 24 hours.
The center tracked many noises and impulses.
The picture shows the thin layers of ashes in the lobby of cars in the area of Mexico City, such as Hodimilko.

The police encountered the catalonic separatists prior to the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after the protesters who spoke for independence faced a special police unit, and thousands of people joined the protesters' demonstrations to celebrate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on the separation.
The proseparatist group, in masks held by special destinations, threw them with eggs and powder paint, which created dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually full of tourists.
The skirts took place and later on that day, the police used the sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence advocates who scanded “Don't forget, we won’t forgive!” faced the conservationists of the country who shouted, “Let Spain live! ”
According to the local press, fourteen people were assisted in the light trauma of protests.
A year after the referendum on October 1, which Madrid declared illegal but celebrated by the Catalan separatists, the tension in the region that seeks independence remains high.
The voters generally voted for independence, but the appearance was low, since most opposed to the department boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were wounded in violent clashes in the past year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at electoral stations throughout the region.
The independent groups spent Friday night in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to go another route.
Narsis Termes, an electrician who participated in separatist protest with his wife, declared that he no longer had the hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“ Last year we survived one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry from the joy that they could vote, but now we're in the deaf corner, ” he said.
Notwithstanding the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties that are acting for independence were unable to preserve the impulse this year, because many of their most well-known leaders are in voluntarily exile or imprisoned in anticipation of trial for their participation in the referendum and further proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who protested police support for the phone, claimed that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The stress is getting stronger," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunnkeras, one of the nine catalogue leaders who have been in the following isolation since the end of the last year, announced that the next year he would be feeding on the European Parliament.
“The status of the European election candidate is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government, ” he said.
Londonderry: men were arrested after the car went into the house.
Three men at the age of 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after the car had entered the Londoner house several times.
The incident was on Ballinagard Crescent at 19:30 on British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is quite possible that at some point the car was fired from the shell.
The Udar of Manga has provided Livingston with a 1-0 victory
The first head of the Dolly Menga in Livingstone became the winner
The exaggerated Livengston class staggered the Greengers and brought Stephen Jerard a second defeat from 18 games as an Abrox club manager.
Dolly Menga’s blow turned out to be decisive: Gary Holt’s team went up one level in a second from Hibernian.
Gerard's team has not won any victory at the Premier Lyes of this season, and the next Sunday is playing with the Harts leaders from which it stands to eight points.
Before that, the Red Wenders will be accepted in the European League by Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues its invincible move to six games in the Division, and the chief coach Holt has not yet been defeated after he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses the chances of improper guests.
The Hallt team was supposed to be ahead long before they killed, as their outrightness creates the Greengers' problems.
Scott Robinson burst through defence, but struck along the gate; then Alan Litgous struck past the gate after he pushed himself and took a stab of Craig Halkette along the gate which he made his head.
The masters were pleased that they allowed the Greengers to play with them, and they knew they could cause problems to visitors from standard positions.
That's how the decisive naked was.
Reingers missed a free blow, and Livingstone made discoveries, Declan Gallaher and Robinson engaged Mengu, who took the ball and killed it from the punitive center.
Before that stage, Rangers was dominated by a ball, but the protection of the owners of the field proved unprofitable for them, and Liam Kelly’s gateway was largely not disturbed.
This trend continued in a second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's blower hit the legs of the Greengers naked Allan McGregor, hit by a gateway in another standard combination, Livingston.
The Naviss were constantly on the line with Livingston’s fines, and they were constantly neutralized, and two applications on the toolbar — after the Halkette attack on Glenn Middlton, which was replaced, and the game behind their hand — were rejected.
Livingstone Fenoman: analysis
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland Stadium of Tony Macaron Aren
The Phenomenal game and the result of Livingstone.
All of them played differently, they continued to exceed the expectations of this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and warehouses has not changed much after returning to the highest level, but it is necessary to pay back Hall due for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkette played tremendously, was very well organized to defend himself, and Manga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warrala to keep on the watch.
"Rangers," however, did not have inspiration.
They used to play very well under Gerard’s leadership, but now they are far from reaching those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- only once, they broke the defense of the owners of the field -- and it was something like an awakening for the Greengers, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdogana was recognised in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin, smiles and blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of the conflicting visit of President Erdogan to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
Some disputes arose among them on such issues as human rights, freedom of the press, and the EU’s entry into Turkey.
Erdogan then went to Kelly to open a huge new mosque.
The city is the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
For reasons of security, the police didn't give 25,000 people to meet in front of the mosque, but a lot of the President's supporters still appeared near to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan — among them many Kurds — also forced themselves to hear them; they condemn Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Two - sided protests indicate the ambiguity of a visitor, whom some German Turks called hero, and others dictator.
Road accident in Depford: A bicycler died in a collision with a car
The bicycle was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the Bestud Street crossing and Evelyn Street on a live road in the Deptford area in the southeast of town at about 10:15 a.m. in the British standard time.
The driver stopped, and paramedics came to the site, but the man died.
This accident happened a few months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from the Chailders Street accident, about 1.6 kilometres from the Saturday accident.
The London police stated that they were working to establish a man to inform his closest relatives.
The traffic is banned and the bus routes are changed, and motorists are encouraged to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin prison: six prisoners are traumatized in violence.
Six inmates were traumatized as a result of turmoil in a male prison of severe treatment, and the prison administration reported.
Her Majesty Long-Lartin in Woostershire, the riots in her prison began about 9:30 a.m. on the U.K. standard time on Sunday, and they still continue.
To halt the violence initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit called Tornado was called.
The officers were provided with medical care in connection with the light face trauma received at the scene.
A prison officer commented: “In the case of the incident in her prison, her Majesty Long-Lartin, was involved with a specially trained prison staff.
Six colleagues received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that the responsible will be sent to the police and their prison term can be extended.”
In her prison, Long-Lartin's Majesty is over 500 prisoners, including the country's most dangerous offenders.
It was reported in June that the prison commander was sent to hospital after the prison attack.
In October last year, a special police department called in prison to stop serious riots, where the prisons were attacked with balloon layers.
Rosa's hurricane threatens Phoenixo, Las Vegas and Salt Lake-Sitti with rainbows.
Tropical depression rarely hits Arison, but this can happen at the beginning of the next week, as the remains of Hurricane Rosa are heading southwest of the desert, causing the risk of rain floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings about flooding on Mondays and Tuesdays from western Arizona to south-east Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstuff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Rosa will go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday and that Monday night will be raining.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the status of tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950,
a Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) from the border of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, in the Mogollon-Rim area in Arizona, it is projected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm and up to 15.24 cm precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Big Basin, are likely to get from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, places maybe up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of rain floods, Rase’s rain can be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful because south-west is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, a little over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is affected by at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First of all, Hurricane Rosa leads to shifts in the Mexican Peninsula of the Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in the power of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometres per hour, is 620 kilometres south of Punta Evgenia, Mexico, moving north with a speed of 19.3 kilometres an hour.
Storm meets more cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and is thus declining.
Thus, it is expected that the day or evening of the tropical storm will cause a turmoil in Mexico.
The precipitation rate in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“ It is expected that the total precipitation from the Lower California to the northwestern Sonora will range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, places to 25.4 cm, ” reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arison border early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and will reach South Utah late in the evening.
“The real danger that Rosa or her remains faces is very strong rains in Lower California, northwestern Sonora, and southwest American desert, ” reports the National Hurricane Centre.
It is expected that these rains will lead to rain floods and garbage streams in the deserts, as well as downturn in the mountainous region.
Midsomer-Norton attack: arrested four people who attacked the murder.
Three teenagers and 20-year-olds were arrested on suspicion of attempting to kill after they found a 16-year-old boy who had been wounded.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsior-Terras region in Midsomer Norton about 04:00 by the British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock district, reported to the police Evon and Tomersett.
The police are asking to respond to all who can have any video recording of these events on the phone.
The trump says that Kavano has endured the infidelity and anger of the Democratic Party
“The Voice for Judge Kavano is a voice against the ruthless and indignant tactic of the Democratic Party, ” stated the Temple on the Willing, West Virginia.
The trump said that Kavano was “suffering the indignity and anger” of the Democratic Party during the entire extinguishing process.
Kavano testified to Congress in Thursday, violently and emotionally denying Christine Blaise Ford's accusations that he had sexually abused her a few decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness to her accusations.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brilliantness, character and courage of the Kavano. ”
“The Voice for Judge Kavano is the voice of one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an incredible experience in the public service, ” he said to a crowd of adherents in West Virginia.
The president mentioned the eruption of Kavano when he talked about the importance of the Republican appearance in the middle-term elections.
“ In five weeks, there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, ” he said.
That's why I'm fighting everywhere for great candidates."
The trump claimed that the mission of democrats was “to stand against and to interfere with”.
It is expected that the first key procedural ballot in the Senate about the Kavano candidature will take place not later than Friday, and CNN was an assistant to one of the leaders of the Republican.
Hundreds of people died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, increasing casualties
At least 384 people died, many fell into the ocean when the giant waves fell on the beach as a result of the intense earthquake and the tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi declared the country’s authority on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting on a beach festival in Palu on Friday, when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) in the twilight crashed off the shore, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami took place after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not start fleeing immediately, and they were victims, ” stated the Briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Puurvo Nugrojo, an Indonesian disaster management agency (BNPB).
“It wasn’t just tsunami, it was moving cars, trees, houses, it hit all that was on the land, ” Nugrojo said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami had passed through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
Some 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The airports published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges turned out and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The treads in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy released as a result of the heavy Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the atom bomb dumped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s geographic position at the end of the long, narrow cove could help the tsunami force.
Nugroho described the damage as “wide - scale ” and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under the debris of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Nugroho noted that victims and damages may be more than 300 kilometres [1,0 m] along the coastline north of Pala, in a area called Dongal, near the earthquake epicenter.
“ The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we received no information from Donghal, ” said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, says the Red Cross’s statement, and it adds that his staff and volunteers have moved to the affected areas.
“ It’s already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger, ” says the report.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting that the tsunami had hit Pala, although officials said that the waves had arrived at the time indicated in the warning.
In the amatories that people shared in social networks, the man on the top of the house shouts out loud warnings about the approach of the tsunami to the streets under the building.
A few minutes later, the water wall smashed into the shore, picking up buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately verify the reality of the frames.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a serious disengagement of electricity, which cuts off the connection around Pala, which made it difficult to coordinate rescue action.
Military officials started shipping trucks with the help of Jakarta and other cities, reported to the authorities, but evacuated people still needed food and other essentials.
The airport of the city was opened only for help, and it would be closed until October.
President Joco Widodo was to visit evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision's coworkers from Dongal have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in the tarpaulin tents set up in the courtyard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseba.
“ They told me they had seen many destroyed houses, ” he said.
That's very bad.
Even when relief teams have taken decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some have complained that foreign humanitarian workers are not allowed to go to Palu with considerable experience.
According to Indonesian rules, financing, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster is declared as a zone of national catastrophe.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the provincial level, ” says Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross. “
Once the government says "Okay, this is a national catastrophe," we will be able to accept international assistance, but this status has not yet been granted."
It's been the second night on Paula after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet been found were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would be a miracle that would decorate these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescue workers received a woman who lay under stone for two days along with her mother’s body.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national paraplanetary team, trained two disappeared paraplanetists to participate in Asian games that took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanters who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
“ As an elder in the field of paraplaneterism, I have my emotional burden, ” he said.
Hendon tells us how a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread to a community of paraplanetists, he desperately sent messages to Pala's rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, his message was marked by only one gray gallop, not double blue.
"I think that means that the message has not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during the replenishment of the banker in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thieves stole 26,750 dollars from a employee in Brink who used a bank at Newport on the Levee, reported in Newport Police Department news.
The car driver cleaned up a bank at the entertainment complex and prepared to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, another man “called back to workmate Brink” and stole a bag of money intended to replenish.
The Witnesses noticed some suspects who fled the crime scene, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these persons should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanie West: ribper changes its name to Ye
Reper Canier West changes his name to Y.
On Saturday, declaring a change in Twitter, he wrote: “More officially known as Kanye West. ”
41-year-old Uest was called Y, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place prior to his appearance in the Saturday Night Live show, where he is expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaced Arian Grande’s singer, who canceled his participation because of “emotional reasons, ” reported the show.
It was not only a shortening of the current professional name, but before West had said that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year, discussing the name of his album with Big Boy's radio guide.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanier, which means "elean," was reduced to just E is just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye is one of the famous ribs that changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Deaddy, P. Deaddy and Dieddy, announced this year that he chose the name Lav and Braser Lav.
Former colleague Westa, JAY-ZI, also experimented with defis and big letters.
The President of Mexico, Andrez Manuel Lopez Ombudsor promises not to use the army against civilians.
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andrez Manuel Lopez Orador promised never to use the army against civilians, and soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre against the students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco, López Orador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military fired a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people, and left student movements began to be founded throughout Latin America.
Lopes Orador promised to support young Mexicans, granting monthly subsidies to those who are learning, and opening more free State universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities lead young people to criminal groups.
US should double financing in artificial intelligence
Since China's increasing activity in artificial intelligence, the U.S. must double the amount they spend on research in this field, considers investor and practice in S.I. K.F. Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after the various parts of the U.S. government made applications for CHI, although there is no formal strategy in the United States in the area of CHI.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: he wants to become 1 on innovation in the SCI by 2030.
“The HlV double budget would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far from the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in the sphere of SHI, ” said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next big accomplishment in CHI will be done in the United States, said Lee in an interview of CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book The Powers of the SI: China, the Sylicon Valley and the New World Order, was published this month Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of the Sinova Ventures Foundation, who invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, he worked on the CHI system that played the best American player at Otello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee noted the previous US government technology competition, such as Robotics Challenge of the Agency for Advanced Defence Research (DARPA) and asked when the following would be to help identify the future prospective participants.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to win the government’s boundary, says Lee.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations," he observed.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have been hiring lights from universities for CHI work in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the area of CHI.
"I believe Green Card needs to be automatically offered to the SCI candidates," he said.
The Chinese State Council published its Plan for the Development of Artificial Intellect of the New Generation in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation for Natural Sciences provides funding for academics, just as the National Science Fund and other U.S. government organizations distribute money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work in China below, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defense established the Joint Center of Artificial Intellect, which aims to involve industry partners and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of the Special Committee on Artificial Intellect.
Also this month, DARPA announced investments of $2 billion in AI Next.
In the case of the National Scientific Fund, he now invests more than $100 million a year in the study of CHI.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to create a Commission on National Intellect Security, has not taken any steps for a few months.
The Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the country name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted on a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a long-term dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia from membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim for its territory, and vetoed Macedonia's introduction to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made an agreement based on a proposed new name, but nationalist opposers to the agreement argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov stated that he would not vote in a referendum, and the boycott campaign would give rise to doubts as to whether the voters would reach a minimum of 50% that would allow the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum bulletin is, "Do you support NATO and EU membership under the conditions of the Greek agreement?"
Advocates for the change of title, including the Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries that have been created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should be paid for the introduction of such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youths of Macedonia, so that it could live freely under the ego of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgieevska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of Parliament said they would support it to make it decisive.
You'll need two thirds of the parliamentary votes to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of violations before 13:00.
However, it was only 16 percent fair compared to 34 percent in the last 2016 parliamentary elections, when 66 percent of the registered voters were thrown into the Urine by their bulletins.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter, Gozé Tanevsky, in the capital of Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumika, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and his son, Dusko, gave their voice to the referendum on the change of the country's name, which will open the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
Before Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardkov was preparing a small scene and putting chairs in front of tents organized by the fighter of the referendum.
“We're for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with a proudly lifted head, not through the office door, ” said Kavardkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of the European-Asian integration."
The Prime Minister of the Hare believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of needed investments in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” said the Hayev after the vote.
He noted that the result of yes would be confirmation of their future.
According to a survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, 30 to 43 percent of the voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the necessary phenomena.
According to another survey by the Telma Macedon TV, 57 percent of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be found to be valid, the phenomenon should be 50% plus one voice.
The defeat of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since the beginning of its work last May.
See: Serhio Aguero, from Manchester City, passes the whole defense of Briton and kills his head.
Serhio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have gone to Brayton's defense and have won the Manchester City on Saturday 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hall Aguera for the 65th minute of the match looked like a funny simple match.
The Argentine attacker was given a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Breiton defenders and was in an open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He walked around one defender, then ran a few more on the edge of Bryton’s fine.
Then he made a left pass, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penal to pay off the Aguero ball, who, by his right shoe, put it into the right side of the gate by defeating the Breiton needle Matt Ryan.
“ Aguera has some problems with the legs, ” said the journalist Citi manager Pep Guardiola.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky that he's killed his head at this moment."
But the initial advantage of the celestial blue in this Premier League match was that of Sterling.
That nak took place at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside the Breiton area.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy did a few touches and continued to pass the Sterling in the direction of the far trouser.
Forward of the celestial blues threw the ball at the gate just before he slid out.
The City will meet Hoffenheim in the group phase of the League of Champions at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rein Neckar Aren Stadium in Zingheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to pick up the glasses at the Rockis
Since Washington Navionals came out of the play-off, there was no significant reason to wait for another start.
But Cherzer, who is prone to rivalry, hopes to go to the pitcher bitter on Sunday, on a game against Collorado Rockis, on the condition that Rokis will still have difficulties in going out to the playoff. Now Rockis is playing one game in front of Los Angeles Dogers in the National League of the West.
Rakis, at least have a Wyld-Card winner with 5-2 on the Nashionals on Friday night, but they still want to secure the title of the first dividen.
"Notwithstanding that we're playing for anything, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers behave here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've seen over the entire year.
Why don't I want to participate in this contest?
The Nashionals will still declare who will be the start-up pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they tend to be Shercer.
The sherk, for which this is the 34th start, took the pitching session on Thursday and could play on Sunday, his typically outgoing.
Washington's right-hand side has a result of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERAs and 300 aut strikes in 220,2/3 innning in this season.
Trampe Hitting in West Virginia
The president continually referred to the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republican adherents in the middle-term elections.
“ All we have done will be placed on a map in November.
Five weeks later, there will be one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's one of the big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm fighting for great candidates wherever I can,," he said.
The trump continued: "You see this horrible, horrible radical group of democrats, you see that this is happening now.
And they're firmly resolved to return power, using any means, you see the foulness, the crap.
They don't care who suffers from them, who needs to change to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give them."
The Mission of Democrats, he said, “Oppose and hinder”.
"And you see it in the last four days," he said, calling the democrats "wicked and mean, disgusting and lying."
He referred to the Senate Judicial Committee by calling the Democrat Senator Diane Finstein by name, which prompted the audience to make a loud cry of displeasure.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you give me a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was a really bad corpus language -- the worst corpus language I've ever seen."
The Leiborist Party is no longer a broad church.
It is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for condemnation, that was almost unexpected.
After all, I'm the last of those members of Parliament who were told that they weren't happy, and that's because we're expressing our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my parliamentary colleague, was almost the same because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
I was sentenced to disagree with Jeremy Corbin.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policies, about national security, about Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East meeting said on Friday: "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight-year-old capacity as a local member of Parliament from the Laborists were the same.
Sadly, many meetings today have a very different tone, and the promise of “more kinder, more soft” politics has long been forgotten if it has ever started to be done.
It becomes increasingly obvious that in the Leiborist Party, there are no different views and every thought is appreciated from the point of view of whether it is acceptable to lead the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues with whom, as I used to think, I had similar political views, began to expect me to turn up to 180 degrees and take a position that I would never agree with, whether national security or the EU's only market.
Always when I speak publicly — and it doesn't matter what I say — followed by a tyrand of attacks in social networks, calling for revocation, condemning the policy of the center, I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Leiborist Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the commentaries are usually political.
I am fascinated by professionalism and the determination of colleagues who face daily sexist or racist attacks, but never refuse.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that the levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbin stated last week that the Leiborist Party should raise a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every "untrust" movement, or change of selection rules, the party is narrowing down.
During the past two years, I received many suggestions, and I was urged not to follow, not to speak so loudly, that “all things were good ” with me.
But I didn't get into politics for that.
I joined the lieborists 32 years ago as a schoolteacher because because of the lack of attention from the government of Tetcher, my class at high school was literally dissolved, since then, I've been trying to improve the quality of government services for those who need them most, whether the local adviser or the government minister.
I've never been hiding my politics, including the last elections.
No one in the Nottingham East was confused by my political views and differences with the current leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday events, I want to say only one thing: in the circumstances where the country goes to Brexit, which would harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Leiborist Party.
I actually have another message, but not for the Notingem Mamentum, but for my voters, both the Leiborist Party and not: I'm proud of serving you, and I promise I'm not going to be threatened to call me back and no political benefit will prevent me from acting according to what I consider to be the best interests of you all.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Air rises
The last two attempts might have somewhat distorted the outcome, but Ire certainly deserved the triumph in today's great entertainment game of the Prime Minister of Scotland.
Now they're headed by a table, this is the only invincible team of ten.
Finally, the excellent defense and the improved ability to use the chances gives the masters and coach Peter Murchi the full right to be content.
“ We have been testing our games so far, and we are still invincible, so I have to be content, ” he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose commented, "I'm paying attention to Air," and they'd better use the chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt for 14 minutes, carried out by Frasier Climo, led the Air forward, but the yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Guz, published by Verriors, allowed mellrose to show numbers, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Climo strengthened the Air leadership with the help of the toolbars and just before the break did and implemented the salo test, which gave an account of 17-5 in favour of Air.
But Melrose started a second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, carried out by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a prolonged delay because of the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, who was removed from the naked field, and from the Restaurant, Air, came forward with the help of Stefford McDawell, who was carried out by Climo.
Bler McFerson, Captain Ir, had a yellow card at the time, and again, Melrose forced another player to pay the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under severe pressure.
The masters returned, but when Strauan Hatchingson got a yellow card for Climo without a ball from the plot line, McFerson made a tachdown behind the Ayre mole.
Climo attempted what he did almost every time he restarted, after that Kyle Row received a blow from David Armstrong into the box and sent a flanker to Gregor Henry for five attempts at the command of the masters.
Looks like a star still playing on a new career in a restaurant.
It looks like a star in the game Ford Kieran is set up for a new career in the field of hospitality, and that's what we can conclude after we know that he's the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC TV series, which he writes and where he shoots with a long-standing comic partner, Greg Hemfield.
Douette announced that the next ninth series would be the last one in the series, and Kirnan seems to be planning life after Craigleng.
According to an official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source of the Scottish Sun implied that Kirnan wanted to enter the Glasgow “prosperous restaurant business. ”
"More Our": Intra-material Bolivia hopes that the court will open her way to the Pacific Ocean
Navy patrols an equipped fleet headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang the ocean-blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are painted by mosquito: “Our right is the dream.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which has no way to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline that Chile has gone away in a 19th-century bloody conflict because of its natural resources, and there is a desire to swim back in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting an international court decision on October 1 after five years of trial.
“ Bolivia has an impulse, a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive outcome, ” commented Roberto Calsada, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the ICJ decision on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will make a decision in favour of Bolivia, which, after decades of subversive talks, will lead Chile to negotiations for Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, charismaic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion in the following year, also holds great hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific, ” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will barely decide for Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the authority to judge Chilean territory and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ’s decision, only six months after the final arguments were given, indicates that the matter was “not difficult, ” said Pas Zarata, a Chilean expert in international law.
The cause of Bolivia has not progressed, and for the past four years it has been possible to retreat back.
“The question of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration, ” said Zarath.
Morales, a warrior rhetoric, blew the remains of Chile’s kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Weltse, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, did not agree that the court’s approval was unusually speedy.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences by gaining mutual benefit, ” he said.
Calsada also denied that Morales — still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America — used the question of the sea as a political crutch.
“ Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
The Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Jong Ho, says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the subordinate countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo seems to be at the threshold of re-launching nuclear diplomacy, which went into the deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ry says that belief that the continuation of the U.S. sanctions and opposition of the declaration of the end of the Korean war will once be placed on the knees of North Korea is “an unfulfilled dream. ”
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps to disarm.
Kim and the American President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyangs take seriously the renunciation of their arsenals, which the country probably views as the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang the next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
On the Paris fashion show, they presented the latest trend of massive main bathrooms, which is already heading on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or hide completely from the sun, you found what you need.
Valentino designers and Tom Brown showed a series of eccentric master decorations in the spring-year-old collection of 2019 on the striking Paris week of fashion.
Very unpractical hats have filled Instagram this summer, and named designers have already sent their bizarre creations beyond the playground.
Valentino shared an extravagant refugee hat with broadly decorated field feathers that covered model heads.
Among other versus axes are adorned with precious coffee stones, a hat of witchcraft, and even a hat-anas, but they are not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also showed an assortment of the original masks — very timely in front of Helovin.
Many of these color - colored masks had stitched lips and more resembled Hannibal Lecter than high fashions.
One creature resembled a submarine swimming with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like a ice cream that had been unstopped.
And if you support this serious fashionable application, you're lucky.
Stilients say that huge hats can go to the main streets of your city.
The versais capellages came into the fashion thanks to the La Bombie, a straw hat with a field of 60 centimeters wide, which was seen at all, from Ryanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
A cult brand behind a very non-practical hat, which was seen everywhere in social networks, gave peace another creation: a straw beach bag of about the size of a model in a bathroom that carried it.
The bag of the yellow-black raffee raffia and the white leather handle was the central element of La Riviera's collection in spring and spring 2019 Jacquemus brand for the Paris week fashion.
The celebrity of Luke Armitage told F Ageman: “In the next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the influence of the designer is so enormous that it will be difficult to ignore demand for a versus axes.”
John Edward: Language knowledge is essential to the citizens of the world.
Scotland’s independent schools support high standards of education, and in 2018, the results of exams that are complemented by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music, and other fields were again achieved.
These schools of over 30,000 students throughout Scotland are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHDS), which seek to provide the best level of services for students and their parents.
Independent schools are meant to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and to make them citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her own language, she's taking it with her heart."
It's a powerful reminder that we can't use English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's latest exams, we see that in independent language schools, the ratings of subjects with the best grades are used.
In total, 68 percent of students studying foreign languages received higher A.
The data collected at 74 schools in SRNS showed that 72 percent of the students received higher A from Chinese, and 72 percent from those studying German, 69 percent from those studying French, and 63 percent from those studying Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now language as a subject is being taught in the same way as the subjects of NTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are being taught in independent school programs and other institutions.
A British Employment and Training Commission survey in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming more important in preparing young people for a future career.
Since more and more promising positions need language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career you have chosen, if someone learns the second language, he'll have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifetime skills.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives the individual who speaks several languages the advantage of competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in Britain, 75 percent were unable to speak in foreign language well enough to support the conversation, while French was the only language in which the ambiguous percentage of people spoke (15%).
That's why investment in language teaching is now important for children today.
Knowledge of several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with greater chances of finding a full - time job.
In Scotland, they will learn their languages at each school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered most important to Britain from the 2020 prospect, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child in independent schools, several languages can always be chosen to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools try to create a educational environment that prepares children and armes them with skills that are necessary to achieve success regardless of what has prepared them for the future.
Now we can't deny that in the international business environment, language continues to be vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be regarded as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to make this choice, diversity, and perfection for Scottish youths.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is director of the Scotland Independent Schools Council
Lebron debuts from Lakers in San Diego
The fans who want to see the first start of Lebron James for Los Angeles Lekers were almost waiting.
Luc Walton, a lecturer in Lakers, announced that James would play on Sunday on the first pre-session match against Denver Naggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, not yet decided.
“It will be more than one and less than 48, ” said Walton on the official Lakers site.
The reporter Lakers, Mike Trudell, reported that James was likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre - session schedule games, Lakers.
“ At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-session games, ” he replied.
Trampa rings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of pre-election rallys from Willing, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump's scheduled next week, including ratings in friendly states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy he has proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and the Trump seeks to form support for future middle-term elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
At what hour will today’s West Virginia evening visit, and how can we see it on the Internet?
Hitting Trump in Wyling in West Virginia scheduled for 19 hours east time today, on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Trump in West Virginia online on a direct episode on YouTube.
The trump will probably refer to the strained hearings that took place this week in connection with the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano charged with sexual harassment and the postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigation is ongoing.
But the main objective of this series of rallyings is to help republicans gain popularity before elections in November.
Representatives of President Trump stated that these five rallyings over the next week are aimed at “activation of volunteers and adherents, as the Republicans are trying to preserve and expand most of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives”, reports Reuters.
“The Congress is so critical to his daytime order that the president will go to as many states as possible, as the strained electoral season is approaching,” said Reuters, a representative of the Thrump campaign who did not want to call his name.
Today’s Willing Stadium of Wesbanco Arena may be scheduled to visit supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second month of his visit to West Virginia, where he obtained more than 40 percent of the votes in 2016.
The trump is trying to help a republican candidate to the West Virginian Senate of Patrick Morrisi, whose rating is behind the surveys.
“ It’s not good for Morrisi that the president is coming to raise his rating in the surveys, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder's Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and have hopes before Sunday singles
After three sessions that ended with a unilateral victory, the day after Saturday may be exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
The whiting pendulum is a fully invented sporting concept that players really believe in, especially in similar competitions.
So when they say that the pulse works?
"They were ahead of six points, and now they're four, so I think we're taking it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spit when he left.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points in front and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their sails, and they're also encouraged, not least by the form of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each made three points out of four.
Singing with his killer blows from those rooms to the grenade shows an example.
These groaning screams of the celebration became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a critical patt and compared the score to the fourth match after he and Thomas had left two points.
His patt, who allowed them to win a 15-hole match, met with a similar scream like this, who tells you that the American team doesn't seem.
“You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match, ” said Sweet.
That's all that each of these players left now.
18 holes to be known.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only couple who did not make the gods on Saturday afternoon, and they also managed to avoid the gods in the morning of Saturday and after lunch on Friday and on the nine last holes on Friday morning.
This run and the way their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they won on Sunday and that they will no longer be popular players except Flytwood or Molinari to secure the potential victory of Europeans when the sun comes over Le Golf National.
Both are desired at the same time on different holes.
However, to talk about the triumph of the Europeans is still early.
The Bubba Watson and Webb Simpeson dispersed with Sergio Garcia, a hero of the morning troboles when he was in pair with Alex Noren.
One goddess and two dabbles on the first nine holes led the Spanish and the sweat to a hole they could never get out of.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It's very interesting to watch for phobols and forks because of the interactions between the couple, because of the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and it's interesting to see how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe is still playing better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of force also showed that the U.S. team is going to fight, and some, especially the Americans, are questioning.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the last day, the Ryder Cup of Europe will have a strong advantage, because after Saturday, it's going to go ahead of the United States with a 10-6 account.
The inspiring duet to Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari got two wins over Taiger Woods, and now they have four balls on Le Golf National.
The European team, Thomas Bjorn, who's trying to return the trophies that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning forbuls with 3-1.
The U.S. resisted more in force and won two matches, but could not reduce the gap.
Jim Furik's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday synchrons to save the trophies.
Flytwood is the first European novel who conquered four glasses in a row, at the same time he and Mollinari (at Mollywood) after the sensational weekends are only the second couple who took four points in the first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After smapping Woods and Patrick Reed in the forbulence, they joined together to defeat the woods and American novel Bryson Dashambo with even more effective 5ta4.
Woods, who pulled two matches on Saturday, showed random bursts of genius, but at the moment he lost 19 out of 29 of his phobols and forsoms and seven matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who didn't participate in the morning phobolas, went back to Henryk Stenson's partner in force to get defeated by 2ta1 from Dastin Johnson and Brooks Coepka, who are the first and third in the world rating.
Europe was unable to do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day to the southwest of Paris.
Three times the chief winner, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans with their two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive victory of 2ta1 over the Spanish John Ram and Ian Poulter in phobols and later won Poulter and Rory McLroya with 4ta3 in force, losing two first holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has the team returned with a four-point deficit in the synchrons, although the Furik team needs nothing to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks like it can't.
North Korea says that "no in which case" will not be disarmed unilaterally without trust
On Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea informed the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States, and that under such circumstances the country would never be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told at the annual United Nations General Assembly that in the past year North Korea had taken “the essential measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear test sites and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“One time, we don’t see a proper U.S. response, ” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
Although Ri has repeated the familiar complaints of North Korea about Washington’s “poetical ” approach to denucleization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement has proved to be important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ree referred to a joint statement by Kima Chen Ina and Donald Trump at the first in history summit between the real president of the United States and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “the dentalization of the Korean peninsula”, and the Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal conclusion of the Korean war 1950 - 53 years, but the United States has stated that Pyongyang must at first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes the call to weaken the hard international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. is insisting on “denucularization at first” and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even denying the“ announcement of the end of the war, ” said Ri.
“ To think that sanctions can tire us on our knees, it is an inexcusable dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings of Kim and the south Korean leader Moon Zhee-In in the last five months, and added: “If the issue of denuclearization was South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have gone into such a deaf corner.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri was sharply different from that of the last time when he told the General Assembly that the targeting of North Korean missiles on the mainland of the United States was inevitable after the Mr. Wicked President called Kima a human rocket, who wanted to commit suicide.
This year, at the UN Trump, who last year threatened “to destroy fully” North Korea, Kima commended Kima for the courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much more would be needed to be done and sanctions must remain in force before the denuclearization of North Korea.
In Wednesday, Trump noted that he did not set a time frame for this: "It'll take two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. secretary Mike Pompeo declared to the UN Security Council in Thursday: “The execution of the Security Council must continue vigorously and steadily until we see the complete, final, confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unequivocally increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block the financing of nuclear programs and ballistic missiles of Pyongyang.
Pompeo met Ri in the United Nations General Assembly bulletins and then told him that the next month he would return to Pyongyang to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea sentenced him for “angster requirements. ”
During a meeting with the Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile as well as the nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures. ”
He said that, according to Kima, he needed “appropriate measures” as security assurances that the Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course on how to rest enough.
The new course at Harvard University this year has provided all his students with more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of cycling all night after filling caffeine.
The teacher found that university students at number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of self - care.
Charles Chasler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professional at Brigam Women’s Hospital, developed a course that he believed was the first such course in the United States.
He decided to initiate a course after he gave a lecture on the impact of deprivation of sleep on learning.
At the end, a girl came to him and said, "Why do I say that now, at the last course?"
“ She told her that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep that surprised me, ” the teacher explained to The Telegraph.
During the course that was first introduced this year, students explain the basis for good sleep habits to help achieve academic and sporting results, as well as to improve overall welfare.
Paul Barreyra, a professor of the Harvard Medical School psychiatry and director of medical services at the University, said that the university had decided to introduce a course after it had been found that the students had been seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
Clock course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there's an image of a room in the group where students click cups of coffee, curtains, coachers and books to learn about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficit on sports indicators, and the importance of the routine associated with sleep.
Another chapter tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, the map of the Campus with interactive icons encourages the participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students instantly.
But we believe they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the health effects of cigarette smoking," added Professor Chasler.
The culture of pride for “drinking all night” still exists, he added, and noted that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is increasing.
A good sleep should be a “secret weapon” of a student to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, even with excessive weight, since deprivation of sleep brings the brain into a famine that causes a constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chasler to develop a course after he was enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard's first year.
He said that that course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the whole course.
The next step, he hopes, will be the request of all postgraduate students to go through a similar training program before they come to a competitive institution.
Professor Chasler recommends that students be reminded of the need to go to bed, and that the alarm be placed in the alarm room, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and light - diameter lamps, and that it can break the circus that leads to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Reingers: the naked Mangi upset Jerard boys
The Reingers survived another raid of the weather: the Dolly Manga hit by a striking team named Stephen Jerrard, with a 1-0 defeat from Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to win its first victory on a visiting match after the February triumph of Saint Johnston, with 4-1 count, but Gary Holt defeated Jerry's second as an 18 game manager. The Jerard team left eight points behind the Scottish Premiership Harts leaders.
Manga killed seven minutes before the break, and Rengers, who lacked inspiration, did not look like he could compare the account.
Now, “Rangers have fallen to the sixth position, and Livingstone has risen to the third, and only Hibernian has the balls ahead of them.”
In addition, Reingers may face another problem, since the Kalum Spence liner was forced to handle the head wound after being thrown out of the guest sector.
Jerard made eight changes in a team that had once passed Ayre to the half-final Cube of the Scottish League.
And Holt released the same "Levie 11" composition that took one point in Harts last week, and was thrilled by the way his opposing boys were oppressed at every step.
Maybe Rangers was dominated by a ball, but Liveingston worked harder with the ball.
They were supposed to kill in just two minutes when Scott Pittman's first pass of Menga to the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the gate of Allan McGregor, but the semi-protector was wasted this great chance by sending the ball past the gate.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free blow had got his Craig Halkette Scheek, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, hit the back of the trouser.
Greengers was actually controlled, but the last third had more hope than belief in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he must get the right to the toolbar at a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Lowers, but the report by Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian appeal.
Reingers has only done two blows at the gate at the first time, but Liam Kelly's former gatekeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassan Culibali, and Ovie Ejaria’s calm blow was almost unconcerned.
Although the overhead of Livingstone was 34 minutes, it may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
Reingers failed again to deal with Jacobs' cooking.
Scott Arfield didn't respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple end.
During the Jerryard break, Culibal was replaced by Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the bucket fell into Morellos, but the impressive Kelly was pulling off his line to block it.
However, Livingstone continued to force guests to play exactly the game they like when Litgou and Halkette do one long pass after another.
The Hall's team could have improved the results at the last stages, but McGraggor had a good resistance to Jacob before Litgous hit the corner.
Glenn Middlton, replaced by the Greengers, made another late application for a fine when he encountered Jacobs, but Tomson took a look again.
Almanah: Geiger’s Inventory
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the time is coming... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that evolved into a device known as a Geiger counter.
Since then, counting Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of populace, for example, in the 1950s Coronado film, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play questionable cowboys-scientists.
Man: What's that?
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these earphones, you can really hear how radioactivity in minerals affects atoms.”
Evans: "Well, it's really pissing now!"
Heiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live.

Then these cells are able to “see” proteins that are common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are reintroducing the patient again.
Test vaccine shows promising results for patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who has received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, the cancer of eggs has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immune cells into the patient, the change in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” common to many protein cancers (HER2) and continue to reintroduce these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofski of the National Institute for Cancer, Bethesdah, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, eggs, lungs and coloric cancer," he explained.
A similar approach, which involves the removal of immune cells in patients and their “training ” to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one type of leukemia.
After the SNL show in the MAGA baseball Studio, Kanye West gave a sharp talk in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the audience
The students in the SNL Studio, on the Saturday evening in the direct air, sanctified Kanyeo after his lamentable speech, during which he praised President Donald Trump and declared that he was going to stand for a presidential post in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in baseball with the inscription "We Return America the Former Glory" he exploded in a tyranny in which he criticized democrats and once again declared his support for the Trump.
"Sometimes during the conversation, the white people ask me, "How can you like the Trump? He's a racist."
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
SNL Shaw was launched by Matthew Damon, where the Hollywood Star ridiculed Brett Kavano’s testimony to the Legal Committee of the Senate in the case of Christine Blaise Ford on sexual violence.
Although Vest's talk was not broadcast in a direct air, the video with his tyranny was presented on the social network by Comic Chris Rock.
Whether Rock wanted to ridicule Vesta by posting the post, he could not understand.
Vest also complained to the viewers that the craftsman’s scene had an unpleasant situation because of the main bathroom.
According to Washington Examiner, the West said, "When I was in the craft, I was rude.
They told me, "Don't go to the audience in this baseball."
They were kidding me!
And then they tell me that I am in a place where the oppressed are silent."
Vest continued, "Do you want to see the place where the oppressed are silent?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to Variety’s weekly report, his commentaries at least twice caused negative reactions to the audience in the hall, and SNL actors looked frustrated, and one of the audience said, "The studio was in silence."
Westa was invited to replace Arian Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reperter McMiller, died a few days before the air.
The West called out to many amazement by performing song I Love it (I love it) in a suit of water Perrier.
The Westa supported the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendes Turner, who wrote in Twitter, "One of the most daring: HOW I KNOW TO THAT THAT ABOUT THE NATIONS."
Instead, Karen Ganter, the leader of the show, wrote in Twitter, that the West is what it is, and it's wonderful.
"But I'm not going to reward him by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his "creature" who, I think, confesses and evaporate the ideology that harms my community.
He's a free man.
Like us," she added.
Before the Reper show, he announced in Twitter that he changed the name: now he's the one he used to know as Kanye Vesta.
Vest is not the first artist who changed the name, he imitates the example of Dieddy, also known as Puff Deddy, Puffy and Pi Dieddy.
College Repertoire of Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lion, and we know that the music legend of the past decades, Prince, changed the name to symbol, and then became "Artist previously known as Prince."
Accusations of attempting a deliberate murder after an attack with a knife at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempting a deliberate murder after another man's wounded a knife in one of the East Belfast restaurants on Friday.

The Public Prosecutor’s Office is an accusation.
The star of the "Game of Thrones" by Kit Herington condemns the idealization of brutality.
Kit Herington became famous because of the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the Medieval Medieval Fentesional Crown Series of HBO Manufacturing.
But the 31-year-old actor of speech condemned the stereotype of a macho hero, claiming that through these heroes on the screen, young boys often feel that they should be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview of The Sunday Times Culture Kit stated that in his opinion, "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the era of Hishteg #MeTo opportune, #catche, etc.).
Kitt, who recently married his colleague on the Gre of thrones, a 31-year-old actress by Rose Leslie, said that he was "sufficiently determined" to deal with this problem.
"I am now quite determined when we are on the slippery path of the idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their adulthood through the prism of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partially responsible for the popularization of brutality by showing extremely courageous heroes.
He went on to say, "What's natural, and what are we planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel pressure to be such?
I think it's a really important question today, How do we change this?
You know, it's obvious that the young guys are out of the right way."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any priquells and squeakwells of the Thrones after the next summer's show was completed, because "he's already done with battles and horses."
From November, Kit will play the real West play, Sam Shephard's story about the film producer and his burglar brother.
As an actor recently confessed, he considers a meeting with his wife Rose the best one he's ever got from the "Related Game."
"In the course of the shooting in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my future life," said Keith.
In a fantastic series that was awarded to Emmi, Rose played Igrett -- love for hero Gerington John Snow.
A couple married in June of 2018, and the ceremony was held in the territory of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China claims a sharp increase of 14% of the new cases
China has reported a sharp increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, there are more than 820,000 people in the country.
In 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, disease has been transmitted in a sexual way, which indicates a change in the past.
For a long time in some parts of China, HIV was spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, as reported by officials of the health authorities at the Yunnan Conference, the number of people who are infected with HIV in this way has declined to almost zero.
However, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China grew by 100,000 compared with the previous year.
Sexual transmission of HIV at times is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but LGBT is often discriminated against.
According to studies, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with other men marry later because of the domination of conservative values in the country.
In most cases, the transmission of the disease is due to the misuse of sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV - related drugs in part.
Maxine Waters denys the senatorial data on the network by her state employee and criticizes the "dangerous lie" and "theory of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Wotters, condemned votes that one of her state employees had placed personal data from three U.S. Senators on their pages in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spread by political observers and websites.
"The blasphemy, the lie, and then the more abominable lies," said Waters in Twitter.
Reportedly, the public information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch of Uta.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person with the Capitol during the hearings of the Senate Commission on the charges of sexual assault against Brett Kavano, a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court.
The data leaked some time after three senators interrogated Kavano.
The Hill reported that on such conservative websites as Gateway Pundit and Red State, information came about that the IP address of the source of leaks was linked to the Waters office and it was able to find the data of its staff member.
"These unfounded claims are absolute untruth, they do not meet reality," continued Waters.
"The co-worker of my office whose personal data and security is threatened by these fabricated and false statements has nothing to do with the outflow of this information.
These unfounded claims are absolute lies, they don't meet reality."
Waters was quickly criticized on the network, and among others was former Spokesperson for the White House, Ari Flaischer.
"This objection is full of anger," wrote Flaischer.
"This suggests that with that nature she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of what he did not do, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not be presumptuous.
He should not ask about the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and calm."
Looks like Flaischer had a parallel between Woters' reactions and the criticism of Democracies to Judge Kavano, who was accused of being too angry when he was listening to Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party, who was балoting to take place in Waters for the results of the intermediate elections, also expressed his opinion in Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's really true," he wrote.
Waters stated in her statement that her office had already informed "the relevant government authorities and the law enforcement agencies of these false claims."
"We'll do everything we can to find the guilty," she continued, "and they answered before the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
An overview of the film "Agent Johnny Inglis: New Mission" is a passive paradigm for spy fighters with Roven Atkinson
Now it's a good tradition to look in every new British film of thought, Brexit, and there's a new part of a series of comic podiums on the Jonnie Inglisch, and the first film called "Jonnie Ingish" was released in 2003, and then the series was renewed in 2011, resetting Johnny Inglish: Re-starting.
Is it going to be a ridiculous, ironic self-satira for what we're inexperienced, a new export potential of the nation?
Anyway, Johnny Ingliss, with his motionful face and his wobbled eyes, got the opportunity to make a mess, and his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As we know, Johnny is a jolly jolly secret agent in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there's a little bit from Inspector Cluzo, a little from Mr. Bin and a lot of things from the guy who played one music note from the "Fighted Wheel" movie at the Olympic Games opening ceremony in London in 2012.
An example of the character is also the traveler and the mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten television advertising of Barclaycard.
In the last film about Johnny Inglisha, there are some good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny Ingliss approached the helicopter in his knights ’ helmets, and the rifle blades about his helmet.
Atkinson's ability to make a buffalo is beautifully uncovered, but humor is passive, and at some point it's too much, especially if you compare to "serious" movies like "Agent 007" and "Missia is impossible," one of those who are also a comedy.
It seems like the jokes are more designed for children than for adults, and I don't feel as ingenious and thoughtful as Atkinson's nasty movies about Bin.
As usual, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
In the British super secret network of spies, hackers penetrate and reveal the names of all field agents, which has become a complete surprise for an active agent. ( Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episode.)
This proved to be the last drop for the Prime Minister, a haughty person who has already suffered a destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity.
The intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she had to engage someone out of retirement.
It's going to fall on a clumsy Johnny Inglis, who now works as a teacher at some supermodel institution and unofficially trains children to work undercover (in this part of the "Spain School of the Year", "Insight for teenagers was a few good jokes."
Insects are quickly taken to Whitehol to an emergency briefing where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller in another time.
The buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of an exalted agitated person is not altogether in line with the talent of Wiki Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to a skerebert, "Betman and Robin" comes back in line and suddenly meets the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletov, who's played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at that time, the Prime Minister comes under the charismatic billionaire's charisma, who earned his wealth in the technology and technology field, and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network, the ominous Jason Volt, who was played by Jake Lace.
The other and Buff are traveling and reappearing their ridiculous ridicule: overwhelmed by waiters, they are fired in a fascinating French restaurant; then they are sowing chaos, illegally traveling abroad on a magnificent Volta yacht; and Inglish sets up a real turmoil when trying to use the virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the planning of the Volt house.
All the stops lead us to the final episode, but by their graciousness and outrage, it is like movies for children.
Incoming film.
And as I looked at other movies about Johnny Inglis, I asked myself the same question: is it that the British movie industry can't offer Roven Atkins the role that really corresponds to his talent?
Leiborists deny the preparation of the plan, according to which the British will work four days a week, but they will receive a salary in five days.
The Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, has to discuss a radical plan that the British will work four days a week, but they're going to be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party wants to commit the company managers to transfer the money saved as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence, to employees, giving them additional output.
Thus, workers will have a three - day weekend, bringing home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will be in line with the party's economic program and will direct the country's resources to support the worker class.
A four-day work week transition was approved at the British Congress of the Third Junion, and it's expected that the workers will be able to benefit from a change in the global economic situation.
The source in the Leiborist Party reported to The Sunday Times the following: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything won't change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Leiborists were not the first to endorse this idea, because the Green Party promised to hold a four-day work week during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Leiborist Party are currently favoring this desire.
Speaker of the Leiborist Party said, "The party's political program does not have a four-day working week, so we're not looking at this idea right now."
"The Shadow" Chancellor John McDonnel presented his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy at a pre-election meeting of the Leiborist Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell stated that he was determined to take back the power of the "loose directors" of the communal industry and the "exploiters."
The "Thin" Chancellor plan also means that shareholders of water supply can not get all of their share of capital if the Leiborist government sets a "deduction" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also reaffirmed his intention to include workers in company management and to create inclusive share funds to transfer 10% of the normal shares of private sector firms to employees who are awaiting annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are telling in 60 Minutes (60 minutes), or can investigations into the case of Cavano, which leads the FBI, change their opinion
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavano, led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court has been postponed for at least a week, asking whether the Republican senators will continue to support the Kavano after the investigation of the office.
On Sunday show 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pellie asked the Senators of the Republic of John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, could the FBI find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
'Yes, of course,' said Kennedy.--
During the hearings, I explained that I had a conversation with Judge Kavano.
I called him after all that happened and the accusation, and I asked him, “Did you really do that? ”
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greham’s opinion will no longer change.
"I think the charges made by Kavano are provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know that this is what Brett strongly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.--
And every one she calls can't confirm it under her oath.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't know what can change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
On this Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival — an annual event in the music world, with an astonishing number of star artists, and an equally spectacular mission — to overcome poverty all over the world.
During the seventh festival of Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be mobilized in the Great Gulf of the Central Park, not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival, organizers seeking to overcome the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival festival, launched in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization hoping to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket for an event (if you don't want to pay the VIP ticket), visitors have to do a series of tasks or actions, such as being taught in the volunteer project, to write an e-mail to the world leader, to make a phone call or anything else to help bring attention to the purpose of the organization, to eradicate poverty.
So are there any results, since the organizers of the Global Citizens have been 12 years old to achieve their goal?
Is it really an idea to reward a free concert, a genius way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "aplicism," when people feel that they really change something by signing an electronic petition or making a Twitter publication?
According to the Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "works" of their adherents aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to claim more than $37 billion of planned financial approvals and programmes that will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group set out as an example of the results of its activities 390 financial obligations and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group estimates that the cost has had a direct impact on the lives of some 649 million people around the world.
The Power of Nutrition, which has a territorial relationship to the UK as part of the investor and realiser project, has committed themselves to "helping children to grow" and has pledged $35 million to help Rwanda to overcome malnutrition after more than 4,700 messages were received in Twitter from the Global Citizens organization.
"In support of the British government, mecenarians, governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of malnutrition a small fact of history," said the representative of the organization The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "works" that called for improved maternal and child nutrition, the British government announced the allocation of funds for the The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?"
The representatives of the Global Citizen wrote, "It's a long and difficult way, so sometimes we're going to fall and fail.
But like the civil rights movements against apartheid to us, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, group The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeanell Mona is just a part of the star artists who will perform this year at a festival in New York, and will lead him to Deborah-Li Ferness and Guy Jackman.
The Minister of the Interior stated that the United States could use naval forces to blockades to prevent Russian energy exports.
According to the U.S. Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, Washington can seek help from the naval forces to prevent Russian energy from coming to markets, including the Middle East markets.
In fact, Russia’s involvement in the Syrian conflict, especially where it acts to invite a legitimate government, was a reason to explore new energy.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to be a mediator in energy trade, as they're already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
"Thanks to the U.S. Naval forces for free passage through seaways and, if necessary, for blocking them so that Russian energy does not enter the market," he said.
On the other hand, it was a non-profit organization that ranked itself as the voice of every consumer in the United States.
He then compared the trade approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually similar.
"Economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy efficiently and replace them with alternatives," he said, called Russia "singlely developed" because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were heard, the Trump Administration set the goal of increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by ousting Russian energy from the market, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this, the Trump administration and President Donald Trump himself are trying to persuade the German government to give up the "unappropriate" project on the North Flux 2, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage of Moscow.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the North Flux 2 gasogen, costing $11 billion and doubled the capacity of an existing gasogon to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Kremlin convinces Washington to stand firm against the project for only economic reasons, which is an example of dishonest competition.
"In my view, we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and consumer should have the opportunity to choose suppliers," said Russian minister of energy, Alexander Novak, after meeting with U.S. Minister of Energy, Rick Perry, which took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position caused a negative reaction by Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German Leading Organisation of the Federal Union of the German Industry (BDI) called on the United States not to intervene in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like when the third country intervenes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Union of the German industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angels Mercel with Russian President Vladimir Putinim.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Worren "seriously thinks" about polishing for president in 2020.
The Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren stated on Saturday that she would "reasonably think" about the presidential bathing after the intervening elections.
During a meeting with the public in Golioc, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
According to The Hill Warren, it was said, "The time for women to go to Washington to set up the government, and for that, there must be a woman in his head."
"First of November 6th, I'm going to think seriously about my candidacy for President."
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of President Donald Tramp, claiming that he would "take his country in the wrong direction.
"I'm extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing the Trampa and the candidate he had proposed for the office of the Supreme Court judge, Bretta Kavano.
In the Friday Tweet, Worren wrote, "No doubt, before the FBI votes, the FBI has to investigate."
However, according to a Friday survey, most Vorren voters do not believe that they should be chatted in 2020.
According to a survey jointly conducted by the Suffolk Political Research Centre and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of potential Messachusetts voted against the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent were supported.
The results of the survey showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick had been more supportive, and that the potential for his presidentship was 38%, against 48%.
In discussing the candidates for other famous democrats that can be chatted in 2020, we also call former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Baiden stated that he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Pailin recalls PTSD Trek Paylin during a visit to Donald Tramp
26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq following military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident occurred on Monday night.
"What my son's going through now, what he's going through after his return, can only understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are going home," she said before the visitors to support Donald Tramp in Tals, Oklagoma.
Paylin called Trek's arrest a "profit that no one pays attention" and said that her son and other war veterans are not going home as they used to be more cruel, and they want to know if they're respecting what they've made their brothers soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country.
According to a spokesman for the police department of Vasil, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and he was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, and he was hindered from reporting the incident of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol.
18 states and districts support shelter policy appeals
Eighteen states and county of Colombia support the new U.S. policy that prevents victims of gangs and domestic violence from granting refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts sent an analytic note to the court counsellor in Washington to support a caller who needed shelter and complained about the policy mentioned.
The full name of the loaner in the Grace v. Ceshn's case is a suit filed by the American Union for the Protection of Civil Rights, in which the federal policy is accused, and which was presented in August, is not open.
The loaner stated that her partner "and his cruel bandits sons" beat her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for shelter on July 20.
She was illegally held in Texas.
Public prosecutors supporting Grace’s claims stated that people in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (frequently asked for shelter in the United States) often face serious problems such as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee policy cancels the decision of the Appellate Council on immigration in 2014, according to which immigrants without documents fleeing domestic violence could be asked for shelter.
General Carl Reisin, the Attorney-General of the District of Colombia, in his presentation on Friday, stated that the new policy "is disregarding the decades of state laws, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires that decisions on refugee status applications be based on the facts and circumstances set forth in such a statement and that the prohibition violates this principle," is contained in the analytic note of the court consultant.
Next, in the analytic note, the prosecutors argue that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States is harmful to the economies of the country, because they can potentially become entrepreneurs and "to fill the necessary labour resources."
In June, the Attorney General Jeff Ceshnes ordered immigration judges that they could no longer grant refugee status to those who escaped domestic violence and banditry.
"The shelter is provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial belonging, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political opinions," stated Sashnes during the presentation of the policy on June 11th.
Providing shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day.
Rescuers desperately try to find the survivors, while the number of deaths in Palu has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, reassuring her boy with a fever at the evacuation centre of the ruined city of Palu.
"Every minute, fast help brings the bodies.
There's not enough clean water."
Some people return to their destroyed homes, take back underfoot to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people have been traumatized, and the hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 points on the Richter scale are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including the two Gueris with a back and shoulder break, rest at the building of the Army Hospital Palu, where patients are provided with open - Sky help because of constant re - pushes.
His eyes filled with tears when he remembered how a strong push shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
"There was no rescue time.
I feel as if I've been squeezed in the debris of the wall,' said Heris, correspondent to the Associated Press, adding that he and his family came to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife begging for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "advancing psychological pressure" with "reclamation that contains propaganda."
A week after the state Chinese newspaper posted on the four pages of the American daily advertising material on the mutual benefits of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to promote propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a fee supplement of China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa following China's accusation of trying to influence the elections to Congress that will take place on November 6, China rejects these charges.
According to Reuters, U.S. officials, the Trump’s statements in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to intervene in American elections mean a new phase of the escalation from Washington, D.C., which aims at pressure on China.
Although foreign governments can post advertising for trade intensification, the trade war is escalating between Beijing and Washington, where they have already increased imports.
According to experts from China and the United States, in the beginning of this war, repressive customs in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa who supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Brensted, the U.S. Ambassador in China and former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, stated that China had harmed American workers, farmers, and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in the Sunday Register, "sufficients pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"To promote propaganda, the Chinese government uses the way for the American people, the tradition of freedom of speech and press independence, posting a payroll advertisement in Des Moines Register," wrote Brenstad.
"In contrast, on street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only the individual voices of the aliens, and here you will not see the true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of developing the Chinese economy, which is a cause for concern, where you can conclude that China's media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but he didn't say what it was.
Analysts warn that by failing from the Kavano, the Republicans set themselves up against women voters before the intermediate elections.
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavano after several indictments for sexual harassment were filed, analysts warn that this could lead to undesirable reactions to future intermediate elections, especially women.
Around this situation, passion is rampant, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to move on to the vote.
Such things can't just play back," said the Saturday publication The Hill, Grant Riger, professor of political science at Maxwell of the Syracuse University.
Riger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, at which last minute he urged Senator Jeff Flake, would be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C, the chief adviser and spokesman for the Progressive MoveOn Group, Kathryn Jean-Perrier said on Friday, "Women will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning the protesters sang "Listopaday is coming!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to the Cavano's approval despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony.
In an interview with Steve Rotenberg's news website, a non-party political observer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"That's what they say right now, and that's true.
But motivation can increase, especially in the 18-29 election women, who have not yet been defined and often voted, if they don't like the president."
Before Ford gave a testimony in connection with the charges of a candidate for the Supreme Court's office in sexual crime, analysts predicted the negative reaction of the voters if the republicans insist on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele stated, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
As the News Channel interviewed, the Director of Priorities of the United States (United States Privileges) said, Gay Cesil, "the right is not to vote in a committee, final ballot, or the fact that Cavano was on the line of the defendants, and how they responded to the situation and how they proceeded."
But the Americans think about whose testimony, Ford or Kavano, is divided, and some more support is given to Ford.
According to a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe in Ford's testimony, while Kavano's testimony believes or believes more than 35% of the respondents.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents said that they believed that Kavano was either giving false testimony, or most likely giving false testimony, while the Ford said the same thing to 30 percent of the surveyed.
According to The Guardian, after Flake’s insistence, the FBI is conducting a review of the charges issued by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under the oath of the Senate Legal Committee on how Kavano attacked her when she was 17 years old when she was alcoholic.
Ramires stated that the candidate for the office of the Supreme Court of Justice showed her his genitals at a party during their training at the University of Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch the "new Internet" to create Google and Facebook competition.
Tim Berners Li, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a new startup to create a competition for Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of a world of technology legend, Inrupt, is to develop a platform with an open source code Solid, the idea of Berners-Lee.
With a Solid platform, users can choose where to store the data and who to access the information.
In an exceptional interview by Fast Company Berners-Lee, it was a joke that Inrupt's goal was world domination.
'We must do it now,' he said about the startup.--
It's a historical moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create a "personal online storage" or a POD.
It can store contact lists, current business lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for personal use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this personal online data store is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal opportunities by data."
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to harness resources, processes, and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform can be made available to everyone.
At present, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, the security platform, purchased at IBM, a few state developers hired to work on the project, and the volunteers' community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lie stated that he and his team do not negotiate with Facebook and Google about whether to do a full replacement when all their business models are undergoing major changes in a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners Li, it was written that the Inrupt mission was "to secure commercial energy and ecosystems and to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners Li transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners Li is an influential figure in the debate about online neutrality.
Even during the launch of the Inrupt Berners Li remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I look very optimistically at the next age of networking," added Berners Lie.
Bernard Vann: celebrated on behalf of a church representative to the Victorian Cross in the years of World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who has received the Victorian Cross Order for fighting during World War I is honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, was awarded to participate in the Belengliz and Leocur on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper balloon four days later and never found out that he had received Britain’s highest military reward.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during the parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire County.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Wann, called "often figurative" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather had made a feat for which he had been rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann moved his battalion through St. Catan through a very dense fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he hurried to the fireplace and with the "very braveness" led a steep forward, and before that one broke into the field gun and destroyed three guns of the enemy unit.
Colonel Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918, a little more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Wann said that his grandfather did what he could never have done and that he deserved respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Wann laid a crown after a parade led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Wann said, "It feels very proud to be involved in this parade," and he added, "the courage of the real hero is showing the honor that so many people show him."
Fani MMA didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, and instead they were shown "Swin Peppa."
Imagine that you're not sleeping all night just to see the tournament of Bellator 206, and you're not allowed to review the main event.
In the San José tournament offices, there were 13 battles, including six of the main programs that were broadcast for the night in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Hegard Musassi and Rory McDonald were ready to get together, the U.K. TV watchers died of surprise when a Peppe pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting.
Some viewers were not thrilled at this, since they had not slept until the morning waiting for the battle.
One of the fans in Twitter wrote that switching to a baby cartoon seemed to him "an unsuccessful joke."
"At the decision of the government of content, which was broadcast at 6 p.m., was inappropriate, so they were forced to let go of the child's transmission,," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of marketing and connections with the Bellator public when he was asked about the television, "
"Swild Peppa," yes."
Bellator Scott Coker, president of the company, promised to work on a broadcasting schedule in order to reach the audience in Britain in the future.
"I think if you talk about a re-practice, we can do it," said Coker.
"Oh, it's Sunday, six in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcasting was turned off, we received a lot of the messages we answered, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical failure, and we tried to remove it.
However, it turned out to be inconsistent with government orders.
I can promise you that this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we're trying to redirect the signal for fans, but we're still on the way.
A really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daley, the Olympic water jumper, says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn't understand that "not everyone looked like him" until he went to high school.
In participating in the transmission of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he said that he had been frank about the rights of gays to give hope to others.
He also stated that his parents had become less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
A nurse who has been conducting the program for a long time, Kirsti Young, went to hospital for a few months.
When he came to the first program, Daley said he felt worse than others when he was a child, because "the community didn't understand when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "To this time, the feeling of lesser value and difference was exactly what gave me the strength and strength to succeed."
He said that he wanted to prove that something was worthy, not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic Olympic Preservation became a famous fighter for LBGT's rights and used the emergence of this year's Co-job Games in Australia to encourage more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he was frankly talking about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and he wanted to give this hope to others.
The world’s three - time champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American filmmaker, Dastin Lance Bleck, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise to him.
Daley married the Oscar Prize laureate, 20 years old, last year, but he said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much in this young age" (in the first Olympic toys he played at the age of 14 and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would have survived similar flights and falls.
In June, a son came into marriage, called Robert Ray Black Dale, and from then on, according to Daley, his "wealthing" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd only think about what gold should get," he said.
"You know, there are things that are much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic Gold is Robbie."
His son was named his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he had diagnosed brain cancer.
Daley said that his father could not accept the end, and before he died, he asked if they had purchased tickets for the London Olympics 2012 because they wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "You won't sit in the first row, because you're not going to be around," said Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually ceased breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the Olympic Games 2012 and gained a bronze.
"I knew that this was what I've dreamed of for the rest of my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympic Games, and there wasn't a sense of better than that," said Daley.
It also inspired him to choose his first song, Proud, in the execution of Gizer Small, which resonated with him while preparing for the Olympic Games and still causes an ant.
The Desert Island Discs program is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday, 11.15 on English summer.
On Saturday, with a tournament match for the Ryder Cup, Michelson was out of form.
American Phil Miquellson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th tournament game for the Ryder Cup, but he has to rebuild the form so that it won't be unhappy for him.
Mikelson, who, in the 12th record, participates in a two-year tournament, led Captain Jim Furick out of the game for the time of the trousers and forks.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-fold winner whole day encouraged the team and trained on the side, hoping to master the emotions.
Since Michelson wasn't famous for the fitting blows even when he was at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete did not fit entirely for the hard golf field of Le Golf National, where the raff is usually punishing for wandering blows.
And if the field isn't that big, the ninth match on Sunday Micelson will have to meet the champion of the Open Championship and the master of the exact strike of Franchesco Molinari, who won all his matches this week in a couple of new Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans who step three points after 12 solitary matches start a good start, Michelson's match can be a decisive one.
Furick expressed confidence in his athlete, and he must have had nothing to add.
"He fully understood his role today, rattled me on his back, embraced me, and said that tomorrow he would be ready," said Furick.
"He has no doubt of his power.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Glory that has done so much for teams last and this week.
I guess I didn't count on him playing two matches.
I predicted more matches, but that's what happened, so we decided to do that.
He wants to be there in the field, like anyone else."
If Mikelson comes out on Saturday, he's gonna hit the record of Nick Faldo, who played the largest number of matches in the Ryder Cup.
In this he may be able to complete his career in the Cup Raider tournament, which never matched his individual achievements.
Micelson’s 18 victories, 20 defeats, and 7 nuisances, but Furick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's ridiculous, bitter, witty, likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's great at the team," explained Furick.
"I think the younger players had a good time driving on him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than a player."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows that the big break doesn't decide anything.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a slight break in front of the solitary matches of the last day's tournament for the Ryder's Coffee doesn't guarantee victory yet.
Danish debuted in 1997 at a game in the Walderram club field, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros took the Americans to five points, but won a slight break in a match with a result of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big break in the Walderra field; a big break in Brooklyn, where we lost, and the Walderram field where we had been forced to win," said Bjorn after watching the winning games of Class 2018 with the results of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at the Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break was 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has been decided.
Tomorrow you have to play with the maximum return.
Go to the field and do all you need to do.
The game will only be finished when the result is on the tabloid.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said before, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know well who are the best players in the world."
Enjoyed by the performance of his players in a complex field, Bjorn said, "I'll never run ahead.
Tomorrow, everything can be different.
Tomorrow, we're expected to have individual matches, and that's something else.
It's cool to play a field with a partner when it's going well, but it's when you're standing alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfist.
Here's how to configure players to speak tomorrow: at the limit of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support, and now he has to show you what he can do."
Unlike Biorn, the opposite number of Jim Furick expects his partners to play better individually, except for Jordan Speit and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
To Furik's point of destiny on the last day, he returned to various sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but he was defeated by a team from Europe who created "Medinah's Chad."
"I remember every cursed word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully like this in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone's side, the players in the middle of the distance are under special pressure.
We put players in the team accordingly, as if we're going to do something unbelievable tomorrow."
Thomas's commission is to try to lead an anti-attack attack against Rory Macilroy, and then Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood, and Ian Poulter were on the first half of the European team.
"The most of these partners, and in this order, I chose because I wanted to share the effort equally throughout the game," so Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German battleship has been postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was to be launched in 2014, instead of the oldest cold war war vessels, but, according to local media, this will not be done by at least the next year because of the malfunctioning systems and the escalating costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, from the spokesman for war, the launching of the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the main vessel of the modern Badene-Wurtemberg fregaths, was postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that had arisen after delivery damaged the implementation of an ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that the Navy ordered in 2007 should replace the old Bremen frigates.
Understandably, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a set of anti-air and anti-corrupt missiles, as well as some techniques to reduce the visibility, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer period of technical security. It is expected that new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit warn that the constant delays in modern warships that would enhance Germany’s military power at sea will also make it obsolete at the time of its entry into service.
The F125 multi-stage frigate was in the headlines of the newspapers last year, when German naval forces officially refused to enter the vessel and returned it to the Blohm + Voss ship in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship’s military ship has returned to a ship - building company after delivery.
There is little information about the reasons for return, but German media mentioned significant “defects of software and equipment” that made the battleship unfit for military operations.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class is about 120 sailors -- it's only half of the military that served in old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it has been discovered that the vessel has a considerable excess of weight, which makes it worse and restricts the possibility of further modernization.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Pfalz frigate is twice as heavy as (7,000 tons) for ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to malfunctioning equipment, another problem was the combined cost of the project, which also includes the cost of preparing the crew.
The expected 2.2 billion euros have become colossal 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars).
Problems in getting new fregates have become of particular importance in the light of recent warnings about the decay of German naval forces.
At the beginning of the year, an authorized Bundestag of the Hans-Peter Bartels Armed Forces reported that in the Navy, there were "little ships available to carry out military tasks."
The governor claimed that the situation had deteriorated rapidly for some time, since the old ships had been released from operation and no new ships had arrived.
He expressed deep regret that none of the Baden-Wurtemberg fregates could fill the Navy.
A National Bat Trust Watches the Secret Life of Bats
A new research on land ownership in Scotland's hills aims to determine how bats use the landscape to find food.
Scientists hope that the results will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take steps to save them in the future.
In Inveria gardens in Wester Ross, scientists of the Scotland National Trading will observe species such as the karlik Netopir and the natopyr pygma as well as the ears of a normal and watery nightmare.
Special registries will be placed in strategic locations in land ownership to monitor the behavior of bats during the season.
The Scotland National Trading workers and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and presence of bat cries.
Then we're going to develop a detailed map of animal habitat and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their habitat.
Rob Duar, a Nature Protection Adviser in Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help you to assess the effectiveness of life care (e.g. meadow formation) and determine how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have declined considerably in Scotland and Britain.
They are threatened by the extensive construction and renovation of areas that deprive them of nesting facilities.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, fly paper, chemical processing of building materials, and domestic cat attacks.
The rabbits are virtually unblind.
However, by hunting at night, ears are more effective in catching prey than eyes.
They use a complex technique of echolocation to detect insects and obstacles to flight trajectory.
In Scotland’s National Trains, which covers more than 270 historical buildings, 38 gardens of special significance, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, the problems of bats are taken seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, nesting checks, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts have even created the first and the only bat reserve in Scotland, and it's located in Triv's place in Dumfrris-and-Gallovay, and it has eight out of ten bat species that live in Scotland.
Controlling David Thompson says it's a perfect place for them.
"In the territory of Triv's beautiful bat conditions," he assures.
"Here are old buildings, many huge trees and other favorable living conditions.
But we need to learn more about bats because of the research that we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need for prosperity."
He insists that it's very important to check the area for bats before doing any technical work, because the unintentional destruction of one nesting site for a young man's output can kill up to 400 females with a baby, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
The animals are forbidden to kill, torment, or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organization.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we haven't discovered the characteristics of many species."
Ronaldou rejects the charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare a complaint against the German edition
Krishtian Ronaldou described the rape as "normal" and stated that people "want to draw attention" using his name.
His lawyers are willing to file a complaint against the German journal Der Spiegel, which published suspicion information.
America Catherine Mayorga accused the front of a constituent Portugal and the Juventus soccer club of rape, which took place in 2009 in the hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldu allegedly paid her 375,000 dollars for silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, Ronaldou turned to 142 million of his fans in Instagram videos, calling the corresponding messages "naklap."
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's accusations are slander," a statement was made to the camera by a five-fold owner of the Golden Ball.
"They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people are trying to get rid of me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy person and I'm all right," he added, smiling.
According to Reuters, lawyers attorneys Ronald are preparing a complaint against Der Spiegel for the published charges they called “unappropriate reports of suspicion of privacy”.
The lawyer Christian Scherz stated that the soccerist would demand compensation for "moral damage in the amount of a serious violation, which is likely to be one of the most common cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
The incident was said to have occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting at the night club of Ronaldu and Mayorga, he returned to the player’s number, where he allegedly raped her, which was referred to the District Court of Clark, Nevada.
Majorga states that after the incident described, Ronald fell on her knees and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who was "one percent."
As noted in the papers, Ronaldu confirmed that he had sex with a model, but by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to an outsourcing settlement because she was afraid of revenge, and she was guarded against "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous agreement because she continues to suffer from the incident that she said happened.
At the time of the incident that Ronald was reported, he was preparing to move to the FC Real Madrid from the Manchester United FC this summer, he became a player in the Italian football grende, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Great Britain will "wonderfully regret" the loss of car manufacturers.
Great Britain's "wonderful regret" if it loses the status of a world leader in the field of automobile after Brexit, warns the Minister of Economics Greg Clark.
He added that he was approved by Toyota UK representatives who told BBC journalists that if Britain left the EU unconcerned, the company would be forced to pause the production and operation of its factory in Bernaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," assures Minister Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer stated that the effects of delays on the border in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The Bernaston Foundation, which produces Toyota models Auris and Avensis, released last year about 150,000 cars, 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain excretely leaves the EU at the end of March, the production of our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain's exit from the EU will be marked without an agreement on international trade.
For example, the BMW company stated that the Mini model factory in Oxford would be closed a month after Brexit.
The main fears of car manufacturers are that Brexit without agreement can cause risks to supply chains.
Toyota's production line operates as operational delivery of parts and materials according to the needs — details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for the cars being purchased.
If the European Union leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruptions on the border in the supply of details that will cause delays and shortages of materials.
And as the company says, the Toyota warehouse can have a lot of details for a single day, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clarke noted that, in the context of the organization of relations with the EU, prepared by Teresa Mei (Chequers Plan), “there is a framework for avoiding problems at the border”.
"We need a deal, we need to make an optimal agreement that I think will not only make it possible to succeed at the current moment but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program at Radio BBC Radio 4.
"In view of the testimony of Toyota's representatives, as well as of other manufacturers, we need to save the high-efficiency supply chains."
Toyota has not been able to report how long production will be stopped, but in the long run, it is expected that increased spending will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, as a result, cause the shortening of jobs.
Peter Zzalaris, head of the unit's professional company in the Bernaston factory, who worked here for 24 years, said that other participants are extremely concerned, "I can say from experience that short-term jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have made a definite and reliable plan to build our future relationships with the EU."
The Trump and Rosenstein meet can be postponed again, marked in the White House
As reported by the White House on Sunday, the responsible meeting of Donald Trump with the Deputy Attorney-General, Rod Rosenstein, could be "repeat for a week" while discussions were under way on Brettt Kavano's nomination for the office of the Supreme Court.
Rosenstein controls the work of the special prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's interference in elections, the relationship between the Trump and Russia's assistants and the potential impediment to justice by the President.
For several months in Washington, D.C., the possibility of a deputy of the Attorney - General threatening Muller’s independence was discussed.
Previously this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about the use of microphones to record Trump conversations and the possibility of the pre-term termination of the President's powers by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the background of reports that the official was going to retire.
Instead, a meeting with the Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for a Thursday.
The Trump stated that he would not want to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid coincidence with the meeting of the Senate Legal Committee, where Kavano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blaise Ford.
On Friday, Trump arranged to conduct a weekly FBI investigation of charges against Cavano, which further postponed the Senate vote.
Spokesman for Trampa, Sara Sanders, gave a TV show Fox News Sunday.
When she asked her about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not intended, maybe it's going to happen this week, and I'm expecting it to be postponed for another week, in view of all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'm constantly watching the press have the last information."
Some journalists disagreed that Sanders had not conducted media briefings in the White House since September 10.
Lead Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the lack of briefing is not related to publicity games, although she added, "I won't deny that they're playing public."
Then she assumed that the Trump itself would communicate more with the press.
"The president answers the question more often than any president to him," she said, "Statistics speaks for itself."
Sanders noted that the briefings will still be conducted, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask a question to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We're trying to communicate often with the press, and it's supposed to be particularly noticeable in the last few weeks, and the ability to talk to the U.S. President is not worse than the press conference."
The trump regularly responds to questions during activities outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, by treating journalists openly and sometimes in awkward way.
Scotland State Health Secretary addressed a letter to the EU employees in connection with fears through Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed a letter to other EU nationals working at the Scotland National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and to ask them to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scotland Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scotland Government has already made commitments to cover the cost of applying for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens working in autonomous government services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "In the summer, negotiations between the Great Britain and the EU on the issue of exit have continued.
But the British government is intensifying preparations for a possible solution without an agreement.
I know that this may be a very disturbing period for you.
That's why I'd like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and countries outside it share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving health services for the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christion Ebercromby underwent an emergency surgery after head injury
Christion Ebercromby, the Defensor of Tennessee State Taygers, underwent an emergency surgery after receiving head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbilt Comodores, which his team lost with a 31:27 account, reported by the journalist of Tennessee.
The chief coach of Tennessee Steit Taigers told the reporters that the player had been traumatized shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he had become bad," said Reed.
By the side line of the coach and medical personnel, Ebercrombie was given oxygen before taking it on the load for further examination.
The official of the Tennessee Steit Taigers team informed Chris Harris of the WSMV channel, which Ebercrombie operated at the University of Vanderbilt.
Harris added that "not yet there's any evidence of the type and gravity of the injury." In Tennessee State Tigers, we're trying to find out when the player got a trauma.
Ebercrombie, second-trainer, spent his first season in Tennessee Steit Taigers after moving from Illinois.
He did five rounds of balls on Sundays before he got out of the game, so in his season, he's 18 overthrown.

This step can be seen as trying to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin’s efforts to attract young voters by making more affordable housing targeted for high - paying workers.
The increase in the customs will include the physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the government will provide additional funds to help those who are forced to sleep under the open sky.
Additional taxes, accompanied by an increase of two - year - olds to a second tenure and real estate, may amount to three percent.
In the Ministry of Finance, it is expected to involve an additional pound 120 million a year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate that is being built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and complicates those who only dream about their own housing.
Many of the wealthy areas of the country, including the capital, are deserted, as a large number of foreign buyers live most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for the downsizing of the public duty to make the housing more accessible to young people.
He blamed large construction companies for maintaining high prices of real estate by buying land without further use, and he urged Teresa Mei to relinquish the quotas for affordable property to fix the "government on the housing market" in Britain.
Corbin announced a number of important reforms in the real estate, including rent control and deprivation of eviction without good reason.
He also suggests that the local councils be expanded in the area of building a new home.
Teresa May said, "I promised last year that I would dedicate my premiere to the restoration of the British dream -- for every new generation, life should be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect market of housing.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
It is not fair, however, that individuals who do not live in Britain and foreign companies buy housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own housing has become unattainable, and the problem of living under open heavens is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "First of all, I'm going to be the chief coach of the Congregated Scotland."
Jack Ross, chief coach of the Sanderland FC, says that "there's the most desired thing" to ever lead the Congregation of Scotland.
42-year-old Scotch took to rebuild a club from the northeastern country, which is now the third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to Stadium of Late this summer, returning the last season to the Prime League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to the second congregated Scotland, but it's all over," -- told Ross during the Sportsound program at BBC Scotland.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the game of a collecting Scotland at the Gempden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful at the position of the main coach of the club."
Ross's predecessors to the Sanderland FC included Dick Lawy, David Mys, Sam Ellardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Die Canio.
The former head coach of the FC Alloa Atletic states that he didn't feel nervous from going to the big club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected proposals from the FC Barnsley and Ipswich Tower.
"On the current stage, I'm going to think I've succeeded if the club comes back to the Prime League.
Because of its structure and its logistics, this club is undoubtedly in line with the Premier League level," he said.
"This will be a challenge, but the other result I'm unlikely to be successful."
Ross has been building a coach career for only three years, and before, he was a second coach at the Dumbarton FC, and he spent 15 months at the FC Garts coach headquarters.
And then he helped Alloa get back to work after the FC went to the third divideon, and in the next season from the Saint-Mirren, he went from the flight stage to the title of the winners of the first dividen.
Ross says that he feels more comfortable now than ever in his game career at the Clayd, Gartlpool, Folkerk, Saint-Mirren and Gamilton Akademical.
"I'm on a crossroads," he recalls, saying to the FC Alloa.
"I sincerely believed that training was more appropriate to me than a game.
That sounds strange, because I was successful, and I was good at it, and I was at some heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges that we have to face weekly.
I still face them in stress and stress, but as the main coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt as comfortable as ever in my adult life as after I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 Sunday - perfect time for beer cups
Summer heat helped increase the benefit of British pabs, who are not in the best times but who have increased pressure on restaurant networks.
According to the calculations of sales in pubs and bars in July, 2.7% increased, while the profits of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consultant, said, "Thanks for sun weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the world championship, July went by the same pattern as the previous month, when the pubs had grown by 2.8%, but restaurants had worse.
The heart drop by 1.8% in July has increased.
Pabes and bars oriented to supply drinks so far have the best rates to increase their income is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
The pubs in which food is served were also affected by heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that the visitors are only interested in drinking.
In the control pubs and bars, the sale of beverages increased by 6.6% per month, and the sale of food decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst for the licensing and hotel industry in RSM, said, "We've seen similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting sales on the domestic market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to lose their profits, and the annual sales drop by 4.8% is a special concern in the background of the need to reduce costs.
We'll see if the temperature we've seen in August is going to be the best time for food feeding institutions, and we'll see if the temperature we've seen is going to be more moderate, and we're going to give them the necessary rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new institutions, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the marketing of new brands.
The gallose indicator of the sales of Coffer Peach Tracker in the pubs, bars and restaurants in Britain is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance rates of 47 working groups, aggregate product flow of more than £9 billion.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from his parents.
As evidenced by the study, 1 in 5 children, sometimes under 11 years of age, have a social account hidden from their parents and teachers.
A study that covered 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible location of sexual content
20% of students reported having a "principal account" showing their parents
Every fifth child, sometimes under 11 years of age, creates an account in social networks that hides from adults.
A study that covered 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram, a social network for photographing.
This news has heightened concern about possible sexual content.
20% of the students reported having a clean "core" account that shows to parents, as well as one or more private.
The mother, who accidentally found a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call to rape me.
A study by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters 'and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools revealed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles in social networks.
The head of the HMC Association, Mike Buchanan, said, "We're really worried about the fact that many teenagers feel they want to create an online space in which parents and teachers cannot find it."
Alied Doyle will be a "representative of the Athletics" in the Scottish Athletics Council.
Alied Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of board members.
Doyle is the most advanced Scotland light athlete, and the head of Yen Beatty called this step an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its broad experience gained at the international level during the last decade.
"Alide has great respect for Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that the athletic sports in Scotland will benefit greatly," assured Bitty.
Doyle said, "I'm going to be an inspirational representative of the athletes, and I hope I can really do good and promote sports in Scotland."
American, a four - time Olympic champion who won a race of 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta games, and now a BBC sports viewer, lost the opportunity to travel through a transit hush attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors argued that only time would tell me if I could recover and how much.
Thanks to the incredible efforts I was able to recover completely, and I have learned to walk again and today to do dynamic exercise!
Thank you for the words of support!"
In the pronunciation of the milk sucker women compared to cows, the Internet users were divided.
The milk sucker producer faced a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising, where young mothers are compared to the cows they do.
To celebrate the release of the product called "the first in the world's quiet bucket of milk," the technology company Elvie, a consumer product, released a humorous music video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the mothers are given to the new reservoir.
Four real mothers dance in a cowed cow under a song that says, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have a tail" and "When you see my tail, it's not a wool, it's my chest."
And then the choir sings, "Sucks, sucks to feed the kids, sucks, sucks out to keep the milk out."
However, an ad on the Facebook page led to a violent discussion online.
The video got 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, but the Internet user response was ambiguous, and many noted that the ad was underestimated by the "terrifying organization" of milk production in the industry.
"Not a very clever decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and have to give milk, but their children have been taken away a few days after they were born,” wrote one of the users.
The Elvie milkweeder can be easily hidden in the uthalter for feeding (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's clear that it's traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why don't you get them to advertise milk suckers for women who need to feed their babies?"
And someone else said, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
The other users were going to defend the ad, and one of the women's videos was "very fun."
"I think that's a brilliant idea.
If she were still breastfeeding, she would have purchased such a thing.
When I sucked the milk, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising is something crazy, but I didn't look for the hidden contents.
That's a great product," someone wrote.
Here's another comment: "A funny advertising based on mommy that sucks milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suckers hidden in their busthalters.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, Elvie's sucker works completely quietly, does not have wires or tubes and easily hides in a busthalter for feeding, which enables women to move freely, hold children, and even walk outside.
Ana Balarin, a partner and executive director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on this situation, "Elvie's sucker is so revolutionary that he demanded a vivid and provocative representation.
After paralleling the women who cure milk and the real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast-feeding, in a fascinating and interesting way, showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new sucker would bring.
Elvie sucker is not the first time in the news headers.
As part of the London Week fashion, the mother of two children appeared on a pubium with this product while showing the clothes of Marta Yakubowski modeler.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to a tent town on the Thai border
The number of delayed migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of crossings between the border has remained relatively constant, partly because the hard rhetoric and the policy of the Tram administration have made it difficult to place children in caregivers.
Traditionally, immigrants themselves were the caregivers of most cases, and now they are afraid to threaten their own opportunity to stay in the country by offering responsibility for the child.
Risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be handed over to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, high director of the Immigration and Customs Office, testified to Congress that the Bureau staff had arrested dozens of people who had filed applications for the care of minors without escort.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of those who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of them are foreigners who have committed wrongdoing.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to shelter workers, to deal more quickly with children's affairs, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear before court within a month of detention, not 60 days later, as they used to.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing rather than come to court personally to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to shelter by court decision will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer the children remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will experience anxiety or depression — the result of violence or attempts to escape.
Legislators argue that these problems are increasing in higher institutions, such as Thornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological situation of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to our friends, we risk increasing the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw the troops immediately.
In addition, speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Waled Al-Mualem, urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country had been in war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also worked as the Deputy Prime Minister, claimed that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the control of terrorism, so "the treatment of them would be appropriate."
"They must go immediately and not put the conditions," he declared at the assembly.
Mualem insisted that the "war with terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He stated that Damascus would continue the "this sacred battle until we cleared all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Asad.
In a war - devastated country, France sent over 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, Mualem assured that the country had created the right conditions for their return, and he also accused some Western countries that those "producing unreasonable fears", which prevented refugees from returning.
"We have called on an international community and humanitarian organizations to help people return," he said.
"We have seen attempts to politicize a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria would not assist in the restoration of the country until the political agreement between the Asad and the opposition to an end to war was made.
UN diplomats will report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create the buffer zone around Idlib, the last great hostage of the rebels, made it possible to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement has prevented the large-scale offensive of the Syrian forces supported by Russia to a province of three million people.
However, Mualem stressed that the agreement had "subject terms" and hoped that military action would be directed against jihadists, including the Al-Qaida Front of Nusra, who would be "disappeared."
UN Emisar Stefan de City hopes to shortly convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include government representatives and opposition to develop a postwar constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Mualem made conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, stating that his work should be limited to "the review of articles of the valid constitution", and he warned against interference.
Why the Tramp Will Be Reopened
According to this logic, the Tramp may be reopened in 2020, if, as many liberal spectators are expected, it does not make the full - time mandate after scandal and impicment.
No doubt that would be "the most dramatical end of the presidency all the time"!
At present, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of watchers in the raid has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, in Fox News, an average of 2.4 million watchers in a time, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the The Rachel Maddow Show program on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of a rating of 3.5 million watchers at evenings when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's beyond our understanding," said Neil Ber, the performing producer of the "Last Candidate" on the ABC Canal of the Secretary of State, who becomes president after a destructive attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skowell, an experienced Humorite writer and author of the book "Look at Funny Points: And a few hard truths about entering a Hollywood club" offers another theory.
She remembered the trip to the Boston taxi before the elections in 2016.
The driver told her that he would vote for the Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," he said, "that's what Mrs. Skowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are able to determine the future of Roe's case against Wade, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Disfellowshipping is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
And yet you can't just say that you're just trying to remain informed by citizens when you watch six hours when a group of experts discuss the use of Bob Woodwood "fine knowledge" sources for your book "Strah," Paul Manafort from the skin of the ostrich for $15,000, and the consequences of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy published by Stormi Deniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be a former one.
"The feeling of realistic show is partly linked to the fact that you are being reconciled every night with something new," said Brent Montgomery, the chief executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the Llombard Stars, the rotations in the actorial warehouse and the daily stimulus of the Tramp show (NFL conflict, support by Kim Chen Ina).
If you allow yourself to miss at least one episode, you can hopelessly stand back.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flace this week at his house on the north coast of Kauai, there was a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he sat at home looking at MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the TV, not when Brett Kavano was standing before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on the hair.
"Remember how we used to make all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flace told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right."

External spending in the most violent intermediate elections in Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, there are additional cash flows, because through the review of the electoral districts, two valid congresses are being tried for one chair.
In the struggle for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives of Conor Lemb, who won another district in the additional elections last spring.
The Lemb stands against another valid congressman, the Republican of Kit Rotfs, which now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely incompatible with the new 17th.
The maps were recycled after, in January, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old boundaries of the districts were in favour of the Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
Pre-election racing in the new 17th district caused a strong opposition between the financial units of the major parties, the United States Democratic Party Committee for elections to Congress (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
The Lemb's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimum advantage in the 18th district during the extra elections at Congress in March, which were widely considered by the public.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won 20 points in this area.
Political experts have given little advantage to democrats.
In the United States, El Salvador was reconsidered for the support of China, but redesigned
The diplomats reminded of Washington’s weak opposition to the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously maintained the position of Beijing.
In June 2017, the Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varel, who had also had a hotel in Panama, until the partners had expelled the staff hired by the Trump Organization.
The government department decided to revok U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the recent decisions on Taiwan's non-recognition," stated the Spokesman of the Department of Geser Noyert in the beginning of this month.
But sanctions were addressed only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million from the United States in 2017, especially in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The fines offered to reduce financial aid and target visas would be painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and killing rate.
According to the internal councils, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity, which took place last year, and was seen as a step forward in the efforts to contain the flow of immigrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, high-level representatives of the Administration were able to understand that they wanted the conference to take place, and in fact, the issue of Sanctions against El Salvador stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pens is now planning to address a conference that is scheduled to take place in mid-October in order to indicate that the Administration considers this event to be very important.
On the other hand, three U.S. messengers quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and Dominican Republic because there were no new reports or punishments from Washington.
Mr. Bolton, a representative in the White House, refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions that had been reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, under anonymity.
The information they provided confirmed by an outside analyst, close to the administration, who also spoke on anonymity.
Learn History
The next problem may be the report of the special prosecutor Robert Muller about possible interference with justice by the Trump, which is strong evidence why public information is available now.
It is reported that, as part of its investigation, Muller checks out the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our vote system from Russia.
If the influence in Congress moves to a different position, the Tempu will have to report to the conventioners, as it is before the voters and, ultimately, the one - party.
There's a lot of "if," and I don't want to say that the fall of the Trump is inevitable, like his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d’état against Hitler if only the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the possibility of avoiding bloodshed.
The course of history is defined by these turning points, and the unrestrained movement of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these critical moments.
What will we do if the Trump releases the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Muller's destiny depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble as the paper reported that last year he offered to secretly record his conversations with the President and to share his reasoning on the tramp disparity of the post.
Rosenstein described the information in The Times as inaccurate.
"How do we react if the investigation of the Brett Kavano case, which recently started the FBI, is not sufficiently careful or honest or if the candidature of Kavano is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite the persuasive accusations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, are we going to be in the middle term to vote for those members of Congress that will be able to hold the Tramp accountable?
If we fail these trials, democracy will face bad times.
But I believe we're not going to go, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had deported to Auschwitz the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my Embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to ignite Saturday candles on a swastic table.
Having that legacy, can I not look optimistic into the future?"

Graham Dorrans of Greengers is looking forward to seeing Vienna's Rapid.
The Rangers is taking Rapid (Week) to Thursday, and after a striking niche in Spain at the Villarreal game at the beginning of this month, the victory over Austrians will provide the Scotland Club with a good chance to get out of G of the League of Europe.
Because of his knee injury, he was able to play his team for the first time in the season with Villarreal, which ended with the count of 2:2, but he thinks that the FC Reingers could use this as a temple to achieve more.
"It was a good outcome for us, because Villerreal is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hopes of getting at least something and getting one point.
Maybe at the end of the match, we could go forward, but, in general, nothing can be considered a fair result.
In the first time, the adversary was better, but after a break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
On Thursday there will be another important opposition in the League of Europe.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy, our future rivals have shown a good outcome in their last game, but we can count on support for the fighters.
The last year, of course, was difficult, starting with my trauma and ending with changes in the club itself, but now the situation was normalizing.
We have a great warehouse, and all the guys are happy.
I hope we can go further, leave the past season and succeed."
Women Lost Sleep — Fear of Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize their own care, few spoke about it with their family members.
About half of the people involved in the research of Nationwide said that they had talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent of the respondents talked about it with the children.
"People want them to be cared for by a family member, but they don't have to have a conversation on the subject," said Holly Sneider, vice president of the National Insurance Unit.
That's where we've got to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: Your family will not be able to provide you with care if you do not report your wishes to your relatives in advance.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the value.
Involve a financial consultant, he may recommend how to cover the cost.
Funding sources for long - term care include traditional insurance policy, hybrid policy, accumulated life insurance, or self - sacrificing security at the expense of your own money (conditionally you have money).
Prepare legal documents carefully, thus avoiding legal tensions in advance.
Prepare trust for a representative who will control your health care and ensure that professionals do your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
It is also recommended that we make sure that money is trusted.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills if you are incapacitated.
Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.

A man shot a few times from a pneumatic rifle when he returned home from a party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford-Grove district in Ilfracum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, his stomach and his hand.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 2:30 a.m. in the British summer, as "an accident."
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life - threatening, but the police are searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, reported by government officials, but the number of victims could increase.
As a result of the departure from the communications system, officials involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance are unable to obtain any information from the Dongal Registry, a district north of Pala, located close to the 7.5 points of the quake's epicentre.
After the disaster, 16,000 people evacuated from Pala.
Consider some of the basic facts about the city of Palu on the island of Sulawesi and the Dongal Registry.
Palu, the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, is at the end of the narrow gulf on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800, according to 2017.
When the earthquake caused the tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a register that extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the 2017 register, the administrative region in the lower province is approximately 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the central Sulawesi province, especially the Dongal coastal region.
Nickel production is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morolavah, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster mitigation agency, Palu and Dongal have suffered several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, tsunami killed more than 200 people in Dongal, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine people died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, northern Sumatra, caused tsunami, which struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which were in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the end of March, in early April, a series of major earthquakes reached the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 points struck south of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, and caused tsunamis on the southern coast, killing some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 points was recorded.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 points struck one of the Mentavi islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami to a height of up to 10 meters, resulting in the destruction of tens of villages and the death of about 300 people.
2016: A faint earthquake hit the Poddjaya Registry in the province of Aceg, causing destruction and panic, which is that people have not yet been able to forget the devastating earthquake and the tsunami of 2004.
This time there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people died under the debris of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the Lombo tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed numerous buildings, and thousands of tourists were unable to leave the island immediately.
Sarah’s eldest son Paylin was arrested for charges of domestic violence
Trek Paylin, the older son of former governor Alaska and the vice president, Sarah Paylin, was arrested for charges of attack.
According to a Saturday report published by Alaska, 29-year-old Paylin of Vasilla, Alaska, arrested for suspicion of domestic violence and charged him with hindering the reporting of violence and resisting the arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took her a phone.
According to KTUU, Paylin is in custody at the Matanusca-Susitn investigator, with the right to entitle a 500-dollar mortgage.
He was put before a court on Saturday where he declared himself innocent when he was asked if he confessed his fault, reported on the network.
Pailina is charged with three misconducts of class A, which presupposes that he will be arrested for a term of up to one year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with Class B misconduct, which is punishable by the day of imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
For the first time, Paylin has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The Court of Veterans of Alaska is currently under review.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, and he was hindered from reporting the case of domestic violence and wore weapons in a state of alcohol when that incident happened.
His girlfriend said he hit her on her face.
In 2016, Sarah Paylin criticized veterans for justifying her son’s abuse by post - traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused tsunamis — hundreds of lives perished
At least 384 people died after an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulaves on Friday.
The quake of 7.5 points caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks and electrical supplies have gone out, and the number of victims can increase in the next days.
The earthquake was near the center of the island of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
The video that's spreading in social networks shows the moment that hit the catastrophe.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Palu when the tsunami set ashore.
Federal accusers demand a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York City.
In New York City, federal accusers demand the death penalty of Saifulo Saipov, suspected of a terrorist in New York, resulting in eight deaths — a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for federal crime since 1953.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov was driving a rented picapa at Home Depot on a bicycle track along the West Sidy highway, Lower Manhattan, and he started beating cyclists and pedestrians on his way.
According to a report about the intention to get executed in the southern region of New York to justify the death penalty, the accusers have to prove that Saips “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious injury to the body.
According to judicial material, each of these points of the accusation involves the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Court of Jury filed Saipov's charges for 22 counts, including eight murder charges for the purpose of prosecuting, which federal accusers usually bring in cases involving organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to the accusers who described Saipa's crime as “wicked, cruel and malicious”, this attack is the result of “real planning and predetermined thinking”.
The victims of Sipulla Habibullaevic Saipov suffered injuries, harmed or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann Laura Decadt, Darren Draq, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferruki, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnukco, as described in the purpose report.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time in the South of New York was a criminal case that was punished with death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug providers, and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the federal execution was carried out in New York in 1953, the couple of Julius and Etel Rosenbergs were executed after they were sentenced to conspiracy for the sake of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to Saipov’s judicial material, the native Uzbek did not demonstrate the reproach of conscience in the next days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigator that he was not sorry for what he had done.
According to Saip’s accusatory act, he told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an attack on the IDIL videos he had watched on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDIL flag in his hospital room.
He did not admit that he was guilty of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saippa, said that they were "very disappointed" by this decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty instead of accepting the confession of guilt and imprisoning permanent imprisonment without the possibility of release will only strengthen the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," said Patton.
Saippa’s defense party had also asked the accused not to try to bring the death penalty.
Parliamentary deputy from the Conservative Party believes that NAYELA FARADJA needs to be appointed responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during the protest campaign at the Nigel Faraj Conservative Party, he promised to "mobilize the people's army."
The former leader of the Party for Independence of the United Kingdom stated that politicians had to "subject the pressure" of Europeans, because one of the parliamentary deputies of Teresa May had proposed his candidacy to hold negotiations with the EU.
The Deputy from the Conservative Party Peter Bown stated at the Burmingham march that the United Kingdom would be "just out" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
Attention to the problems May faced in trying to reconcile its deep-separated rows further attracted the fact that members of the Conservative Party who were against the exit joined in a special protest action in the city against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to implement the Chequers compromise plan despite attacks by Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The allies insist that she will not give up the attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will make the Europeans and the lieborists choose between what she suggests and chaos.
At the rally Leave Means Leave in Solikhal Mr. Bown stated that he wanted to "retreat Chequers."
He invited Mr. Farajo to leave the shadow and take responsibility for the Brussels talks.
"If he were to answer, we'd already go out," he said.
The parliamentary deputy of the Wellingborough added, "I'm going to support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars, not to subordinate.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bown rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed, "The idea that the British changed their minds and didn't want to come out is absolutely irrelevant to reality."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also at the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Prime Minister, listen to people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition isn't going to vote for it, it doesn't support our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for the votes of the voters.
"Please throw Chequers away and start listening."
In her address to Teresa May, she added, "The Prime Ministers retain their position when they fulfill their promises."
Mr. Faraj stated that politicians should "subject to themselves" if they're going to give up the 2016 referendum decision.
"This is now the question of trust between us, the people and our political elite," he stated.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say they won't get away with it."
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, which plans to betray the Brexit idea, to feel pressured.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to the victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become independent, self-ruly, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opponents passed through Birmingham and then held a two - hour rally in the center of the city.
Several activists were waving banners with Conservators against Brexit when they started the group with these weekends.
The Leiborist Lord Adonis ridiculed conservatives because, after the opening of the conference, their party program caused security problems.
"These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technology needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good at Brexit," he added.
Vorren is planning to "seriously think" about polishing for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren stated that after the elections in November, she would "really think about the politicians."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during the general meetings in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party from Massachusetts spoke about its future.
Vorren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, балotes on the second term in November against a member of the Republican Party Jeff Dela, who was co-chaired by the Trampa campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is viewed as a major candidature that can overcome the Trump in 2020.
On Saturday, she had a 36th meeting with the voters in the form of general meetings since the Trump took office.
The attendant asked her if she planned to participate in the election of the president.
Vorren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington to do government work, and there's a woman on his forehead."
They arrested a suspected murder from a firearm basketball basketballist called LUS Taigers. Sims.
In the Baton Rouge police, Louisiana, on Saturday, they reported that on Friday they arrested a suspected murder of a firearm basketballist called LSU Tigers, Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge police declared the arrest of 20-year-old Dyon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. in the east.
On Friday, they published a video shooting with a request to help me identify the person on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot by the University of Sautern on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims has received a gunshot wound in the head and as a result has been killed," stated on Saturday to journalists 247sports Chief of Police Murphy J. Paul.
Wade gave up for his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, Simpson was found to be at the crime scene, had arms with him, and fired at Wade Sims.
Simpsona was arrested without incident and taken under guard at the East Bay district police office.
Sims, who grew six feet and six inches and who spoke in the Junior League, grew up in Bathon Rouge, he played 32 star games in the last season, and on the average he spent 17.4 minutes on the field, he picked 5.6 points and 2.9 picks.
Gran Prie Russia: Lewis Hemilton cut back in the struggle for the title of the world after the team decided to give him the victory over Sebastian Fetel.
From the time that on Saturday, Valtaire Bottas left behind Lewis Hemilton, it became clear that Mercedes’ command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas had a good start with the Polish and almost walked around Hemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettele the opportunity to attack his teammate.
The fettel went to the pit-step first and left Hemilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was about to solve.
The Mercedes pilot traveled another circle and left behind Fettel, but Hemilton blew himself into the leaders after a certain wheel manoeuvre, leaving Ferrari unwillingly the inner space because of the risk that he would be compressed, after a double manoeuvre had succeeded in breaking forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of the grid and remained at the seventh place until the end of the first circle.
He was able to lead most of the race because he did not change the tires to quickly come to the finish and move Kimi Ryconen from the fourth place.
In the end, he stopped at pit-step on the 44th circle, but he couldn't increase the pace by the last eight, which made Rycconen situated fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because Waltter was putting up on every weekend and manifesting his nobleness when he gave me the opportunity to drive through.
Hemilton said, "The team has done an extraordinary job to get first and second place,"
The Body’s Language Did Not Survive
On a Saturday rally, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Finstein for her firm position that she did not publicize the contents of a letter by Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses the candidate of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano of sexual violence.
During the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee, but he did speak of events in the Senate that he said demonstrated human "feeling, disgusting and lying."
"The only thing that could have happened, and all the marvelous things that's going on in the last few days in the Senate is the anger, you see the wicked people who demonstrate the vicious, the abominable and the lies," he said.
"You look at the publications and the public information, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do that.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you share the information?
Remember her answer... you announced the contents of the documents?
Oh, no.
I didn't advertise."
Wait a minute.
We've announced?... no, we haven't announced," he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Fainstein received a letter with a detailed report of the charges made by Ford v. Kavano, and in early September its contents were advertised, but Finstein denied that the leakage of information had occurred in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't disclose the information I received from her," said Finstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this secret, and I didn't break my promises."
But her objection seems unpleasant to the president who commented on the Saturday ritual, "I'll tell you, the language of her body was not impressive at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone staying worse."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual violence, the president assumed that democrats used charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to return power in any necessary way.
You see the folly, the foulness, they're all the same as the one to be offended, the one through whom you have to cross over to get power and control," -- Mediaite quotes the President's words.
"Dandy Stars" is "Belfast Jayants," 5:3
The Giants player, Patrick Duyer, throws two chaibes in a match against Dandy.
Dandy Stars was rehabilitated for the Friday defeat in the elite league of the Belpast Jayants, winning a Saturday match with count 5.3.
Jayants was given an early advantage in two chaibes thanks to Patrick Duaier's throws and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney compared the account to the home match, and then Duyer took the Jayants forward again.
The Dandi player François Buchar compared the account, and the two heads of Lucas Lundwald Nilsen provided their victory.
This is the third one in the elite league season, the defeat of Adam Kif's team, who's won a free victory over Dandy with an account of 2:1 on Friday night in Belfast.
It's a fourth team meeting in the season.
Duyer’s first chaibo was thrown in four minutes (3:35) after Kendall McFall was handed over, and four minutes later Bowliè, who received a chaibo from David Rutherford, doubled the bill.
After a tense first period of fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the land owners to the game, and at sixteenth minute (15:16) Kouni, received a chaiba from Matt Markward, compared the account.
Duyer took advantage of Jayants before the first break, throwing his second chaibo at the end of the first period.
The field owners regrouped, and Buchar for twenty - eight minutes (27:37) again compared the account by throwing the chaibo when his team was multiplied.
Thanks to the efforts of Koney and Charles Corcoran Nilsen at the end of the second period, he first brought Dandy forward and provided the victory for his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Jantes team, which has lost four out of five last matches, plays a visiting match against the Milton Kines.
Aviadapester died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
Aviadapester in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped to fly a plane with hundreds of people at the price of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many were missing after the severe earthquake caused by the tsunami on the island of Sulaves on Friday.
Strong underground impetus continues to shake the area, and many people are under siege in the city of Palu.
However, apart from their colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his position in the dispersed tower at the SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to make sure that the flight of 6,321 Batik Air Air, which was then on the airstrip, was safely lifted into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was ruining.
Later, he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian Air Supply Company, Johannes Seraith, stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Ballipapan to Kalimantan, which would take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pala.
"We're sorry to hear about it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, as a disaster relief agency claims that access to the cities of Dongal, Sigi, and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may increase, because many bodies are still under debris and many of them cannot be reached," said the representative of the Sutopo Purvo Nugrojo agency.
The waves that reached six feet [6 m] were devastated by the city of Palu, where mass burials would take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes deliver help and food.
Cousum's Reese, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News, "Every minute, a quick help to bring bodies.
Clear water is not enough.
The min-markets are robbed everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN, "Indonesia's Red Cross hastens to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse."
President of Indonesia, Joco Video, came to Palu on Sunday and said to the military in the country, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?"
At the beginning of this year, more than 550 people were killed by earthquakes in Lombo.
Aviacacastrophe in Micronesia: As reported at Air Niugini, after the plane fell into the lagoon, one man disappeared
The airline that was flying a disaster in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that one person had disappeared from the deceased, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the drowning plane.
At Air Niugini, it was stated that one passenger could not be found by a Saturday state.
Airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators.
The airline was not promptly responding to a request for more information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped to save other passengers and teams after the plane fell on water while trying to land at the Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men were taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
The cause of the catastrophe and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon near the airstrip.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew through a landing strip.
A U.S. passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was flying very low over the ground.
"That's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others managed to get to an emergency exit on a tone plane while they were on a belt in the water.
He told me that the stewardesss had panic and shouted, and that he had received a light head trauma.
The U.S. Navy reported that seafarers working near the refurbishment of the dock also helped to deliver people to the shores by using a naval boat before the plane sank at 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network in the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in air accidents associated with PNG airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restored the chronology of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man charged with burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
A U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roolett testified as an expert in the field of operational development for a few hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to reproduce a 29-year-old prosecutor Quinton Tallis and a 19-year-old Jesse Chambers victim on the night of murder.
Roolett, according to The Clarion Ledger, told him that he had received data on where he was from a few mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Senford, the police went to talk to the last one.
On Saturday, Senford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in the city that day.
When the accusers asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said that night he was at Sanford's peacap, Senford said he was "fair because I was in Nashville."
Another inconsistencies was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
The recordings of telephone conversations indicated that they knew each other only a week.
Roolett explained that a short time after his death, Chambers Teleis removed text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased it from his life," said Gail.
The defense should be based on its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later on the same day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hipp-hop?
The three hipp-hop-ops want to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group from Bristol argues that hipp-hop has changed its nature -- has gone away political ideas and struggles for solving social problems.
They want to go back to the leaks and make the conscious hip hop again popular.
Artisans such as The Fugees and the Common have recently witnessed the resurgence of this trend in the United Kingdom thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
In New York, the nanny filed a couple for liberation by receiving a "racist" message.
In New York City, the nanny filed a couple for disqualification after receiving an incorrect message from her mother with a complaint that she was "one black."
Marriage denys that they're racial, comparing the lawsuits with the "request."
Lincy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed concern when she saw that the new nurse, Gisel Morris, who came to her first day in 2016, was black.
"No, IT'S ONE TEMNOSKYER," said Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in the report.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, after acknowledging her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and released Miss Maurice, and she said that their previous nurse, who was an African woman, had a bad job and she was waiting for a baby girl from the Philippines.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Maurice now submits a couple to the court, hoping to receive a payment of a salary that she would receive in six months of work in a marriage that she was first hired for, although without a contract, to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them that you don't have to do that," she said to Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racist, the couple claimed that the release of Maurice was a wise decision because they feared that they could not trust her after having offended them.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racial,' said the Post her husband, Joel Plasco.
'But would you have left your children with a man who was treated rough even if that wasn't intentionally?'
Your baby?
NATIONS."
Comparing the lawsuit with the "suggestion," Plasco said that his wife had a child only two months ago and "not recovered."
"Would you have retaliated after that?
It's a bad thing," added an investment banker.
Although the court’s trial still continues, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple in social networks, criticizing their conduct and logic.
According to a new letter, the publishers of Padington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
Bond Karen Jankel's daughter, who was born almost immediately after the book had agreed to be printed, said, "It's hard to put herself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's ridiculous, because we know of the enormous success that the story of Padington has achieved."
In telling her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, he was optimistic about his job being rejected, and she shared how, at the 60th anniversary of the release of the book, she felt "joy and sad," because my father died a year ago.
Regarding Padington, which she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
"He was a rather modest man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as a child of his own, because when children reach something, we're proud of them, even though they're not theirs, not our winners.
I think he looked at the success of Padington like this.
Although Padington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to say good - bye to the phone.
After her daughter landed, she was transferred to the 2 Hospital of Louis Pastera in Nizza, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her life.
"Now he phoned regularly, saying that everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperus.
"And then over called me and said that she would die in the next two minutes and I must say good-bye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashy, darling, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The cures that doctors gave her to keep her heart beaten gradually ceased to act and came out of her body.
She died some time before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what's going on at this time.
I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I should've really kept myself in my hands."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperus, who was burning because of her daughter's loss, sat on the plane along with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I put my head down and couldn't hold back my tears.
This is hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep empathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two Woeful Women Leave Postcards to Prevent Suicide on the Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sheron Davis and Kelly Hamphris are left on the Wally Bridge with telephone numbers that can be supported and messages that would inspire them.
My son, Miss Davis Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he committed suicide.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same as I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydney, told me that her son was a forward-looking chef with an attractive smile.
"Everybody knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room lighter."
But he quit before he died because he was "because of the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body after he killed himself.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards, so people knew that there were people to whom they could go and talk to, even if it was just a friend.
Don't lock yourself in, you need to talk."
Miss Hamfris, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she had lived for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say he felt depressed that he had depression or something like that," she said.
"Several days before Christmas, we noticed it changed."
And on Christmas day, he was completely discouraged, and when the children opened their gifts, he didn't look into their eyes or anything."
She told me that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they must survive it, "It's devastated.
It's on the family.
But we have to keep living and fight."

The future Bretta Cavano hangs on the hair: the FBI is starting to investigate
"I thought that if we could get what we asked -- limited in time and nature of the investigation -- we might have reached a certain agreement -- said Saturday, Mr. Flake, and added that he was afraid that the committee was "solving" in the background of the unsuccessful loss of loyalty to the political party.
Why did Mr. Kavano and his Republicans not want the FBI to conduct an investigation?
Their reluctance is tied to time.
The intermediate elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6, and if the Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously make their attempts to vote their own person to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Kavano, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush's rule and who made sure that he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit now, the vote will take place.
I still don't know if Mr. Kavano could get at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice President Mike Pensu to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidature to the Supreme Court.
During Kim's reign, the number of winners from North Korea has "slowed"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of escapers from North Korea to South Korea reduced, declared a South Korean legislator.
Pack Pione Seug, referring to the data from the Ministry of the Union of South Korea, stated that last year the number of winners was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park stated that key factors were the increased border control between North Korea and China, as well as that smugglers transporting illegals now demand more money.
The Pyongyangs held back from public comments.
Most of the winners from North Korea eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, it was stated that over 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than a well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the intercessors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally in war, has improved markedly in the last months.
At the beginning of this month, two leaders met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, which was the stalemate of negotiations.
This was after the June historic meeting of President Donald Trump and Kim Chen Ina of Singapore, where they agreed in general to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yon-Ho blamed the U.S. for not making progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, we can't be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no unilateral disarmament," said Ri Yon-Ho in his presentation at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bretta Kavano "esterial" and says that he's not good for work at the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives of Nancy Pelos called the candidate for the office of Judge Bretta Kavano "histerical" and stated that he was not in the temperament for work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I've been thinking all the time that if a woman had ever done so, she would be called "hissterical," "Pelosey commented on her response to the Kavano witness to the Legal Committee of the Senate in Thursday.
Cavano emotionally denied the charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when both were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavano behaved very emotionally, and sometimes he almost shouted and hesitated, discussing his family and school years.
He also condemned the democrats openly in the committee, calling the charges against him "absurgent and coordinated destructive of reputation," organized by liberales, who were angry that Gillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential elections.
According to Pelosi, Kavano’s testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his biased attitude toward democrats.
"I think that these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and Democrats, he will take his own candidature," she said.
Pelosi was indignant when she was asked if she would try to announce Kavano an impictment if his fault was confirmed, and if most of the democrats in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say that if he doesn't tell the truth of Congress or the FBI, it's not just for work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelos.
Now Kavano is a U.S. court of appeal in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about the possible decisions of the Kavano against the law on affordable medical services, or Rou v. Weida, because it's considered to be a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approving the office of Kavano, the question of whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions was ignored.
"Now it's not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, biased person and we'll say how great it is," said Pelosi.
Women must possess this weapon.
These are just words that contained the months and years of fury, and she could not utter them without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," said Miss Stanem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's something unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "One woman who worked as a executive director somewhere and was very helpful to me, she said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own technique, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to the speaker, "You might think I'm sad and crying about it.
And I am evil."
And after that, she just went on.
I thought it was incredible."
Tears view anger as permissible in part because they're perceived differently.
One of my most frequent memories of my first job in the office, where men worked mostly, was the situation when I once wept from an indescribable anger, and the older woman, the indignant manager I always had, grabbed me for the collar and pulled me to the staircase cage.
"Never let them see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be happy that they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Congressman for Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on an extramarital connection on board a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not vote for president.
"It wasn't a very thoughtful decision," she said laughing at me 30 years later.
"Seven other candidates were already in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "The White Snow and Seven Dwarves."
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in the congregation, so she promised that she would not take part in the race if she did not collect $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who spared $1,000 in support of men, only gave her $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a talk and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was enthusiastic -- thankful to the people who supported her, disappointed with the system, which made the collection of money very difficult and forced the voters to look differently to the members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as to the anger on sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Miss Schroeder the press response.
You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they're going to write on my tomb plate?
"She's crying?"
How the U.S. - China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-C. trade war were desperate, and although far before it was completed, long-term divisions between countries could benefit Beijing.
The U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot this year, taxing major Chinese exports, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest situation this week has been due to new tariffs at a total cost of $200 billion (150 billion pounds) that actually pays half of all the goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently putting the same one from five to ten percent per American goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has committed itself to taking similar U.S. measures, and the second largest economy in the world is unlikely to miss the opportunity to live up to that promise in the near future.
Forcing Washington to retreat means accepting the demands, but for President C. Jinpin of China, the U.S. public worship is too disgraceful.
However, as experts believe, if Beijing takes the right advantage of the situation, pressure in a trade war from the United States can give China the advantage in a long-term perspective by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sudden economic collapse in any country, and it is actually more a threat than the observers had previously recognized," said analyst Ebigail Grayce, who deals with Asian issues at the center of analyst for New American Security.
The Foreign Minister stated that Syria was "ready" to return the refugees.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to seek help in restoring a land devastated by war, which lasted over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Waled Al-Mualem, stated that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have now been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have affected their everyday lives and limited their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem stated that the Syrian government would be pleased to accept help to restore a war-breaking country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional help or assistance from countries that support rebellion.
Europe consolidates the victory on the Raider Cube in Paris.
The European team conquered the Cup of Ryder in 2018, when the U.S. team won a total of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated six times in Europe and has not won the Cup of Ryder since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team recruited 14.5 points to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Micelson, who tried most of the tournament, struck his first long-range blow on the 16th pair 3 in the water and gave way to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian Golfist Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of the four players that ever went from 5 to 0 from the start of a modern tournament in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated by a 5.4 player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turbierna Olesen from Denmark.
Dastin Johnson, who's in the world rating, has gone down to 2.1 Jan Poulter of England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Serhio García, a veteran called the Raider Cubca, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most of the tournament all the time, bringing 25.5 points for his career.
"Only I don't cry, but today I can't do anything.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's a team's merit, and I'm glad I've been able to help," said Garcia after the victory in Europe, with no emotion.
He passes the estaphet to his fellow countryman John Rema, who on Sunday defeated the American legend of Tiger Woods Golf in a solitary game with account 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud of the victory of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods has lost all four matches and now has a career record on the Ryder Cup tournament 13-21-3.
Strange statistics are for one of the greatest players of all time who won 14 Major tourists, only going to Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. congregation was trying to reach the Febre zone for all weekends, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high - class golf throughout the entire tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after a grudging talk, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we had a short reign over Europe.
We fought.
I'm taking off my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Raider Tournament Committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud that I'm their captain.
They should not be disapproved.
We lost."
