White bread, please.
White sand on f3, black sand on e6, white sand on g4, black on h4 - mat!
Whites: a1, pitch on b6, king on c8. Black: sands on a7 and b7, kings on a8, elephants on b8. Whites put their rivals in the position of bugzwang, putting a6 strips, leaving the blacks with only two choices: to take a6 or move the elephant to any other field of diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move the sand from b6 to b7 and put the mat. In the second case, the white foam takes the black sand on a7 with the same result.
