The social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan area is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Changes envisage the maintenance of travel concessions in public passenger transport.
Since 24 September, the provision of concessional travel for citizens has been changed using the Ivanian Region ' s social map.
According to the press service of the Russian Government for the Ivanova region, the changes provide for the maintenance of patrimonial travel facilities and bring the social mapping scheme into line with the requirements of Federal Act No. 161 on the National Pay System.
At the same time, the social map of the inhabitants of the Ivan area is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changing.
Thus, the replenishment limit is now not set for travel, as before, but for money, with winter and summer periods not exceeding 400 roubles, and for summer periods not exceeding 800 roubles for the current month.
The social map of transport receipts will now need to be monitored, not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of money.
The cost of concessional travel for citizens would be 1/2 the tariff of the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The timetable for the replenishment of the social map remains the same, from 24 counts of the previous month to 23 times the current month.
The new social map travel order will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed account of the spending of money on the social map accurately to the copies.
In addition, there is a possibility of returning the enumerated but unspent funds.
Additionally, the circulation scheme with the carriers becomes transparent, as now half of the cost of travel is paid by a citizen, and the same amount is paid to the carrier for the budget.
No commission will be charged on the cash map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Roads and Transport of Ivanov, reported that more than 33 million visits were made in the region in 2014 using a social map, and nearly 25 million in 2015.
The area budget for concessional travel of citizens using the social map provides for more than 470 million roubles.
As at 1 September, compensation for this purpose amounted to over 312 million roubles.
A 911 teacher is admitted to murdering a friend
During the 911-sound call, the teacher of the veil Shannon Lamb told the police that he had shot his friend and that they needed officers to come to their home.
The Lamb stressed that there's a "pesic" in the house that's alive but is probably upset and said that contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the house, the police found Amy Prentis' body and a note written negligently on a white leaf of lined paper: "I wish I had all returned, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, according to the authorities signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that the Lamb, who had conducted two online courses at the Delta University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had been able to travel 300 miles to the university campaign, where the police believed that he had shot all the distinguished professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police at the Delta University of Linn Baford reported that the university had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true call at 911 shortly thereafter.
By the end of the day, the victims will face one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The following day, after the shooting at the school led the students and teachers to hide behind the locked doors, the authorities were still trying to construct the motivation of Lamba.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff members who knew him, helped to compile a portrait of a talented but possibly concerned teacher.
The students told me that they looked forward to his studies.
The police in Gothya, where Prentis died, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal proceedings.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book in which he expressed appreciation for the "pretty people" with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both were taught at the 17 teachers ' Faculty of Social Sciences and History, and many students attended lectures.
At the same time, there were some preconditions for problems.
One of the students who spoke well about Lamba, Brandon Bivers, reported that he was also worried and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Saix, reported that Lamb, at the end of the school year 2014-15, told him how he was coping with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the University of Delta to give him sick leave, saying that he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university employment rules meant that the doctor ' s degree in which Lamb worked so hard would not guarantee him automatic appointment as a teacher.
William Laforge, president of the University, reported that he knew nothing about the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but, "Surely, Mr. Lamb had something in his mind."
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
The police attacked Lamb after he escaped from the campaign when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, the Lamb shot 38 calibres at the back of the house, one mile south of the home of her parents in the Greenville suburbs, Mississippi, informed the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson County.
His engine-operated car was still on the driveway.
It was inconceivable why Lamb had come to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people who lived there.
The Lamb grew up in those areas.
Lamb began to work at a university with 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and teaching.
He was given a PhD in the spring of that year.
One of Lamb’s old friends described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful person.
Carl Hayrston told me that she was 15 and Lamba was 20 years old when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a great old boy who's been trying to teach her to play the guitar for a few years.
In those years, he had been successful with women.
All the girls were hiding when he was there," says Heirston, who's now 40 and lives in Jackson, Brendon's suburbs.
Lamb and Prentiss must have met for a while by the moment of events.
During the 911 Lamb call, he said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lytning, who lived with them in Gothya in a brick house whose reverse side goes to a channel.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Printis' ex-husband, Sean O'Stin, reported that they had divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they had a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," told O'Stin about her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he wasn't dating Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played bluz.
Lamb met Prentis when he and Abigail both were at a summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, barman, and co-member, the facilitator of the entertainment programs in the lighted bar The Julep Room in the front of Gothya, said that he had last seen Lamb and Prentis in the evening of 5 September, when the Lamb finished playing a guitar and a lip cannon for few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and laughing at each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a teacher who died, conducted seminars for first-trainers and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, explained by Don Allan Mitchell, English teacher at the same school.
He was married and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the student brotherhood and student self-government.
At the Delta University campus in Cleveland, on Tuesday night, some 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in the memorial ceremony of candles burning.
The wife of Schmidta Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended a ceremony during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The sessions will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to return our students," said Laforge.
The crisis is over.
It's a healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report was facilitated by the authors of the Associated Press by Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santan in New Orleans.
The material was edited as a result of the police statement that Lamb's call had taken office 911 after Schmidt's murder, and because, although Lamb was referring to Prentis as his wife when he called at 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us reports that it will not employ the same staff for the holiday season as last year, with the child toy and goods marketer assured that it would provide staff and temporary staff with more hours of work.
The company reports that it is planning to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and wholesale bases throughout the country, less than the 45,000 recruited for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin interviews with the claimants this month and increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although several months before the holidays, the buying season is getting closer and companies are preparing for the hiring of temporary staff to have enough staff in the stores and for the sale, shipping and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is kidding Princess Diana about a date.
The premiere of the "Naway to the Future" film was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater and waiting for the royal family to come, I noticed that the place next to me was free, and here I was hung up, and I would be sitting next to Princess Diana," he told the trailer about the documentary "Basing Back in Time."
The movie begins, and it comes to my mind that I'm literally at the distance of my hand and in one false gay from dating Princess Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary film on "Hope for the Future" includes an interview with Fox, Lia Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as Robert Zemekis and executive producer Stephen Spielberg.
The premiere of the "Rear to the Future" film took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it's undoubtedly the greatest movie about travel in time that has ever been filmed."
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and some movie theaters in October.
The head of the United Nations declares that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in response to Russia's military support for Syria, states that for almost five years of conflict, “the military solution does not exist” and the increase in armaments will only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the United Nations once again called upon all participants, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations in order to find a political solution.
Mr. Ki-moon stated at a press conference on Wednesday that he planned a meeting with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the five permanent members of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Great Britain and France - during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and local authorities, had “delivered the situation”.
Mr. Ki-moon called on five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity as they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme for Iran and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is not kidding
Some tried to label him as a provocator.
Others turned away from him, taking it as a joke.
And some demand a scandal.
But as some republicans try to overturn the high position of Donald Tramp in the surveys, they failed (before).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed the advantage of Donald Trump in two-digit numbers, and some began to seriously ask what it meant for real estate magnity in terms of chances of nomination.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that the Trump has the chance of nominating the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at that time, in 2011, Ricka Perry had given up his favoritism to Herman Kane, none of whom had conquered one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in general elections.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Political Activity Supercomitant, and the Economic Conservative Group of the Growth Club, recognize the undiminished force of the Tempa and begin to deliver their dollars to overthrow it.
These are some numbers of surveys that show that the real estate magnet is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympatheticism for Trump were turned 180 degrees.
Directly before Donald Trump announced his candidate in mid-June, a survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive attitude toward this real estate magnace.
By mid-July, that was 40 per cent.
This was 52 per cent in early August.
Six out of 10 Republicans now have a positive attitude toward Donald Tramp.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators prevail in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republicans there were positively associated with the Tempa.
Two thirds of GOP voters would have set up a Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they were either "thankful" or "satisfactory" if the Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "disturbed" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates an approximate level of enthusiasm, such as Trump (43% say they would be “thankful” to 40% of those who say the same about Trampe).
Next level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be “unsatisfied” or “disturbed” if Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans do not view the Temperature as a problem.
While the Trump is widely criticized for his boasting and insulting, 52 per cent of those inclined to republican voters throughout the country believe that the magnat has a suitable temperature to be a president, as the ABC News/Washington post survey showed on Monday.
The same figure is shown in the first closed congregation in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of Republicans think that he is the same person who may be the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent think that he is not the person who can be effective in posting, and nearly six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to that idea.
When they wear their hats, the Republican voters think the Trump is serious.
On the question of who was the most likely winner of GOP nomination, four of the 10 said that the Trump was favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's no longer true when four out of ten were put on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters had no right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle of the republican cycle, four out of 10 chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Tramp campaign to be persuasive.
Even if the Republicans were to join around another candidate, the Trump was still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that this dispersion is likely to be the advantage of the Trump, and at the same time, non-Trump supporters are equally distributed to support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical “one” competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always receives support from the majority.
He has preceded Karla Fiorin at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points, and finally Randa Paul, John Cassic and Chris Christy at 33 points.
He's got nothing with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's on his way?
Ben Carson shot a businessman at 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one for one."
Less than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of the Tram voters say they are certain of their voices.
Obviously, much can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that it will never change.
46 per cent said that they left the door open to other candidates.
However, the most intense competition of the Tramp is at this time, with a colleague-autsayer, Neurosurgent Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have changed their minds are likely to select the Tempa.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with the Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago described immigrants from Mexico as “violent” in his campaign, the topic of immigration has become the most relevant in conversations in 2016.
Some are concerned that the Trump Reserve will turn the key voters of Latin American origin away from the Republican Party and will hinder the rebanding.
But according to an ABC/Post survey held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with the Trump on immigration.
Therefore, as long as immigration attracts universal attention, it appears that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
The disappointment of the Government is taking on new developments.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now looking forward to support from about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsaiders.
Seven out of 10 Republicans on Monday, a new ABC/Post survey stated that they wanted a political outline rather than a person with government experience.
And they're also offended in Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa, conducted two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the Republican activities in Congress, with 54 per cent “unsatisfied” and 21 per cent “in anger”.
The Government will decide the fate of pension indices in October.
Vice-Primeier RF Olga Holodec stated that the Government was now looking for options for implementing the pension indexation law in 2016 for a real inflation rate, transmitting the WG.
She noted that the decision should be found by 8 October, at the time of the introduction of the draft budget for the next year into the Government.
In addition, the Cabinet discusses the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulated Russian pension.
The hungerer noted that the pension accumulation amounted to 350 billion roubles.
Approximately the same cost of full pension indexing for next year.
According to the Vice-President, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Famine believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not apply to socially disadvantaged categories of citizens, it is not fair that society pays for him.
Previously, the media reported that the cabmina was considering two options for the State budget balancing.
Why do ages often become irritated and redish?
An official doctor, Tatiana Levashov, replied:
Our ages are the widths that protect the eye apple from the many small particles that sit on them.
Forgetting a regular era, we often contribute to the development of blefarit.
Logout simple:
Don't keep your eyes dirty with your hands, bear with you a special wet salphet for the ages.
No less than 1-2 times a day purify the edge of the ages of their accumulated in the day of harmful substances.
Cleaning procedures shall be complementary to the warm compressions with the heating of curative herbs (shalpheas, rubbers) which will incite the thick secret of salt irons and then massage the edges of the age to be carried out by the circular movements of the fingers;
If you have to clean the cheques, do not use alcoholic beverages.
They dry and dehydrate their skin and contribute to the deepening of the salt secret.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear agents have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the Yonben nuclear complex, works “to full power”.
This was reported on the country ' s Central Telegraph Agency website.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the United States “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “as by quantity and quality”.
The latest nuclear test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have since not been reported.
Pyongyang claims he was able to create an atomic warhead.
The DPRK has also repeatedly tested medium- and small-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zyrinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian hymn.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Girinovski believes that a reference to a fraternal union should be removed from the national hymna.
He said that during the Lord's Meeting, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"Very long hymn, the world's longest, not even the athletes,," said Girinovski.
The deputy believes that all four persons should be removed, containing this line:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovsky stated that the current hymn needs to be changed to "God, King Save", and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Asaad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
The President of Syria, Bashar Assad, called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Asaad is sure that Europe must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East if it wants to address the problem of refugees.
The question is, not that Europe accepts or accepts refugees, but that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If the Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on this problem.
"This is the question of refugees," he said in an RT interview.
We must continue the dialogue for consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible as long as people die while bloodshed continues and people feel safe.
“In this way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot achieve anything until we win terrorism in Syria,” Asaad stressed.
Let's recall that some 500,000 migrants, including Syria, have arrived in the countries of the European Union during this year.
Eurocommission stated that the current migration crisis in the world has been the largest since the Second World War.
There may be thousands of militants of extremist “Islamic State” militia among the arrivals in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia may use the situation to create their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
German residents set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a leader in the admission of refugees, although it had recently strengthened border controls to contain them.
The authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany before the end of this year, although some experts call significant numbers.
Since early September, over 90,000 refugees have arrived.
Jenny Hill, BB, was a visitor to Darmstadt, whose residents have a very warm welcome to migrants.
Jeremy Corbin is debuting to the Prime Minister in the session
Following the elections, Mr. Korbin is expected to debate at the session of the Prime Minister ' s affairs with great eagerness
The new leader of the Leiborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will shortly speak to the Prime Minister for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first of the six issues on the afternoon; his statement is likely to be followed closely by the press and members of Parliament from the Leiborist Party.
He called for less theatre and more facts in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that some meetings could be missed by leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Korbin as leader; it will take place after he has been appointed a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Congress of the Tred Junion on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the leader of the Laborists to stand silent during the execution of the national hymn in the service on Tuesday, and during the 75th Bitwa commemoration of Britain, criticized a number of conservative members of Parliament and became the subject of several advanced articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing a public hymn attracted attention
The Spokesman, Mr. Corbin, stated that he was “respectful silence” and recognized“the Heroism of Royal Air Forces in Bitwe for Britain”.
However, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, informed Newsnight at BBC 2 that he would advise the leader of the lieborists to sing the national hymn “independently” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers refused to join Mr. Corbin's team, arguing differences in economic, defence and international policies, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant said that political differences would also be “scraped” in the Laborist party after Mr. Corbin was appointed to serve in the European Union and limiting compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin said at the conference of the Tred Junionov that the Leiborist Party had amended the idea of limitations as a whole.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow Minister of Labour and Pension Payments, stated that the party had “full clarity” that it had only been in opposition to the Government's plans to reduce the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the lieborists, with whom David Cameron will meet at the Cureer's box in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the lieborists, who promised a different approach to politics, stated that he had “cluttered collective resources” in order to capture the ideas of Mr. Chamberon's issues and had received more than 30,000 proposals.
Aylington Nort, a member of Parliament, stated that the Prime Minister ' s questions were undue confrontations and that he would refrain from the insolvent responses and exchange of craves, instead of promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Eagle, Minister of Economics in the Shadow Cabinet, would replace him with the Prime Minister when he was not present, for example, when Mr. Cameron was abroad.
He also made the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor when possible, saying that he had addressed the Speaker of the House of Communities to John Berkow to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to abandon the political “yarma balagana” style, often associated with the procedure with the Prime Minister, but admitted a few years later that he failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister ' s issues have become a key indicator of leadership ' s views, their ability to govern the House of the Community and their reputation in other members of Parliament, although critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires extensive reforms.

UK Growth Pounds of Sterlings
Pound rose in British wages, with the FTSE 100 index raised by the proposal to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, British earnings, less bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate has been the highest since 2009 and has been seen as an early projection for possible growth of caterings.
Pound sterling grew by more than 1% in relation to the dollar to $1.5505 and 0.84 per cent in relation to the euro, €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index has grown to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller shares grew by 20 per cent as a result of the purchase proposal made by the Competitor AB InBev.
The deal would unite the two largest beer companies in the world by gathering brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares grew by 0.9% in the background of encouraging news from the competing group of lux Richemont producers.
The latest sales data for Richemont exceeded expectations and showed that the sales in China -- the key market for Burberry -- began to grow again.
The Glencore shares grew by 5 per cent after the mining giant stated that it was able to obtain $2.5 billion by posting shares, which was done in the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi stocks of the Mondi paper and packaging group were leaders of the fall in the index - by 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs reduced the group's rating to “sale”.
JD Sports had grown since the sports-producing company reported an increase of 83 per cent prior to the six-year tax to £46.6 million.
The Chief of JD Sports says that higher wages can hinder the expansion.
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Caugull said that an increase in the minimum wage for British workers meant “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will outweigh the cost of work, he says.
Expenditures could have an impact on plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean a reduction in additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the Aldi pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The best food provider, on the bottom initiative, launched an IGA market share protection campaign in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the forthcoming influence of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two whole warehouses and the first of 120 shops in South and Western Australia early next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food providers and advance IGA brands through marketing in leading media and social networks and in events like “Adelaide Show”.
The campaign is joined by IGA Rheiters and suppliers, such as the Simmo's ice cream producer from Dansboro, who offers degostation at IGA stores, and the owners of shops selling permanent clients tickets to South Australia's football League matches.
Metcash is expected to provide more details of its protection strategy on 29 September, the day when this optimal food provider, alcohol and economic products will hold their annual investor strategy day.
There is much to do, since in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA brand stores account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash stores and show higher cost-effectiveness than Metcash IGA network in eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known as traditional routes, so the market is more favourable for IGA Rielers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the UA and 24 per cent in WA compared to approximately 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will consume 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of its first shops, taking the marketing volume from all players present, but mainly from independent pioneers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA marketers can lose $360 million a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The projection is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in SA next year and 30 in WA, reaching $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Metcash could cost the company about 13 million incomes to pay interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share in the market in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Kongley, and this is because a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
In Morgan Stanley, it is believed that the sales of Metcash food will fall by 3.3 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the share of the company in the market from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the Chief Fiscal Manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "have a high chance of disappearing in a decade.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Metcash Board of Directors contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA in the market has declined from 18 per cent to 14 per cent from 2010, and the Metcash income from the food business, which the company has supplied to approximately 1,200 IGA Residents, has fallen 43 per cent since 2012 as a result of the operational delegation and the pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company does not surrender, spending more than $150 million annually on retail price equations in kong and Woolworths at thousands of positions per week and helping IGA Ritalers to restructure trade areas, as well as offering rapid expansion of fresh products and wider selection of firm foodstuffs.
Director-General Metcash Ian Morris said that price equations and trade areas were being converted, and hoped that the company would gain an increase in net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hili
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism for his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis suffered indirectly in the recent scandal around his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more respect for his conduct than critics, as President Tennis Australia, Steve Hill, said.
Kokkinakis, a younger in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was immediately a focus because of the shameful intercourse of Kiryos with Stan Vavrinka on the tournament of the Monterrey Masters.
Shortly thereafter, during a hot qualification match in the Cincinnatti, a judge on a tip had to take two different Kokkinakis and his adversary Ryan Harrison, and Harrison said, "Vaurienka had to put on the shovels of Kiryos, and I have to lay the shovels on this guy."
Since Kokkinakis' last sight of a missile raiding after a shipwreck in his leg saved Richard Gaske from the possible defeat on the US Open, Hili loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The young man is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be the second one after Bernard Tomich alone in the semi-final of the Cup of Davis v. Britain.
"I'm very worried about one thing, namely what Tanasi's got into the conflict," said Hili.
He really broke a missile when he had a leg on U.S. Open, but he wasn't the first player to break the missile when the hopes broke out, and I know Tanasi well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he owned himself very well in quite provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I am sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think he's been a little dishonest.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he's a lot of worker, he's a great team, he's never had problems with other players, he's respected outside the cortex, he's intensively trained, he's in excellent form, he's a very focused and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated with dignity.
Heli also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match beginning on Friday, believing that “consent” was the right way for all, but expecting a guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
"Before all we want the team to focus on the match, not on the disputes around [Cyros]," said Hili.
And I think Nick gained power very quickly, which proves Federer's and Marray's people, he grows in the eyes of the public, he has made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think he needs to take him out of the focus for a while so that he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, delays migrants
In announcement of a state of emergency, Hungary closed the border with Serbia on the southern border on Tuesday and delayed those who attempted to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants.
There were riots on the border, hundreds of migrants accumulating in the border area, and the Serbian authorities reacted severely.
Stalled indefinitely in the road between the two country crossings, people fleeing from armed violence in their homeland broke tents and settled in the area.
However, there was growing dissatisfaction.
When a police helicopter rippled over them, migrants shouted "Cover the border!" and yelled insults against the Hungarian police of a special appointment.
Some protested by refusing food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia declared “unappropriate” the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when they arrived more and more from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of a solution, not a related damage.
Negotiations should be held with Brussels and other countries in the near future”, stated in Prague, Ivica Dachic.
The waves at the Hungarian-Serb border began the day after the cluster of 28 countries had been unable to formulate a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to have a common responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed the hope that, in the next month or by the end of the year, there would be an agreement that the States members of the European Union would receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angel Mercel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded that an emergency summit of the European Union be convened next week to discuss the immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect an early action on the part of Brussels or neighbours.
The emergency announced on Tuesday in the two southern regions gave the authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to cross roads and expedite asylum courts.
In the meantime, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Siyarto, stated that his country also planned to raise a barbed wire at the border with Romania to overturn the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had finished the fence at the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even inmates had been connected to urgent work after completing a barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the main “road place” and the EU border crossing point for settlers, many of whom are refugees who are victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nevertheless, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people who have arrived in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life rather than refugees who are victims of the hostilities that are entitled to protection, and this view differs sharply from that of other EU countries, to the point of view of Germany.
New laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now regarded as a crime of crossing or damage to a 4-metre (13-foot) barbed wire built by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for the accused of trafficking.
“The Hungarian Government declares a state of emergency because of the situation caused by mass migration,” said the journalists, the representative of the Government of Zoltan Kovać in the southern city of Seged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
The formal Parliament must still authorize the deployment of military forces, expected next week, but the reporters of the Associated Press, who are at the border, have for several days observed the presence of armed forces with vehicles and dogs before their teeth.
Dierd Bakondi, National Security Advisor, reported a survey by authorized authorities of 45 persons trying to cross the border at the very border, and an additional 15 people inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, being detained by the police and being accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are rebuilding the fence quickly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passageways on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning by harnessing one of the passages of a railway car wrapped with a barbed wire.
The disturbances broke out on the main passage across the border near the city of Ryoske, Hungary, since the vernacular had placed a service space to pass people inside the metal container, and crowds of people pushed each other to break through.
Approximately 20 people were able to grasp inside, and thousands were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main traffic leading from Serbia to Hungary and declared no food and water to go to Hungary until they were released.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton ' s succession over Bernard Sanders declined twice in the national survey
Former secretary of Hillary Clinton continues to hold a dual advantage in the Democrats race for nomination throughout the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent among primary democratic voters (from 58 per cent below), while Sanders is second with 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he intends to participate in the presidential race, receives support from 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
More than five months before the rivalry in the primary elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that they have been identified with the candidate to be supported.
Clinton's advocates are more confident of their choice than those that support other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and moderate ones, but this has been reduced.
Her support fell substantially among men, and Sanders stood behind only five points.
The premium given by Clinton democratic voters for up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now on equal.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders for a two-digit number among Liberians, but Sanders now has a five-point advantage in this group.
Almost half of the primary democrat voters throughout the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she had become a candidate for the party.
A fourth would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six percent would not have supported her.
It may not be surprising that the current supporters of Clinton will likely be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, the views are more controversial -- only about a quarter enthusiastically would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Klinton's supporters ask open questions about why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that the Presidency's time (13 per cent) is now and that she is the best candidate (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also refer to the association that links it with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called the agreement on issues and the chances for election.
As the Vice-President considers potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic voters would like him to join the race - although a third believes that he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among party candidates, the primary democrat voters were mostly called Baiden.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half they'd choose Baiden the second, it's more than Sanders.
If Baiden decides not to stand out from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton ' s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baiden to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of democrat voters see a candidate in Clinton with the best chance of winning the general elections; however, that figure declined from 78 per cent last month.
According to this indicator, Baiden has had a large backlog in the second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that is most important for the candidate, democratic voters choose other options other than the chances of being elected.
Similarly, in the past month, no candidate for democrats or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominant for these primary voters.
Candidates from democrats, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and credible people with good leadership qualities.
Baiden of all three leads honestly, and the strong side of Clinton is in her leadership.
Thirty per cent of primary democrat voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and credible, twice as much as those who speak the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain view of it.
Primary democratic voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Baiden as similar.
On all these measures, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While the questions regarding the personal mail and server of Hillary Clinton are continuing to be in the household of her Secretary, most of the primary democrat voters are satisfied with its explanation and believe that this has not affected their general view of it.
But that's a different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are today dissatisfied with its explanation, but only about one third are satisfied.
The views of the public on this matter were shared in March shortly after the story was known.
Most Americans say that the debate on e-mail has not affected their general view of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinions on it have deteriorated.
These are mainly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinions about Clinton have deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered to be honest and credible voters from her party, it continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent believe that she is honest and credible, eight points below the last month, and 15 in comparison with May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it fair and credible.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Tramp to be honest and credible.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good leadership marks.
Of the six protested candidates, Baiden, Carson and Bush show the best results of honesty.
Most people see in Sanders a fairer person than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion about him.
The limit for errors for samples of 351 prime democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson was close to Donald Trampa, as a result of the national survey
Ben Carson right up to Donald Tramp in the last CBS/New York Times survey.
Two candidates obtained half of the voters in the new poll, leaving all others in search of support under the legs
Republican voters throughout the country continue to support the Trump, whose support increased from 23 per cent in the recent CBS survey held on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson took off the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson is supported in all demographic groups by shaping Tempa in a group of top-level voters.
The remaining candidates, except Carlis Fiorina and Governor Ohio John Casic, went back with Governor Visconsin Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
The former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi and senator of Florida Marco Rubio, together took a third place from 6 per cent.
The limit for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus-minus 6 per cent, and the survey was conducted in September.
A recent survey of CNN/ORC, published last week, showed Carson ' s growth in surveys, showing 19 per cent support for Republicans, with 32 per cent of support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Carson’s Temple is substantially ahead of Carson.
As Carson's support increased last week, Trump made several critical incidents against the former neurohiurg, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Trump.
"We need energy," said the Trump last Saturday at the close of the Iowa campaign.
Five members of the fraternity are accused of the death of Baruch College
About two years after the death of a college student, a murder charge was filed against five persons during the fraternity ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania.
"The Brotherhood of Pi Delta Psy of the New York College Baruch brutally attacked the Chan Maikla Denga during his dedication in September 2013 and did not take him to the hospital on time, which led to his death," reported the police.
Officials say that the student with his eyes tied and a 30-foot backpack with sand behind his back were pushing several times while he was trying to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The Pi Delta Psy brothers did not call at 911 when Deng lost his consciousness and waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, and they were told by the police.
They, however, found time to change Denga's clothes, find his symptoms in Google, and contact Andy Menga, national president of the brotherhood, to ask the council, as Chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"In that moment, the brothers began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the brotherhood above the health of Michael Denga," said Chief Wagner.
He was unable to save, and he died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng has received several dull head injuries, torso and thighs.
“More families have suffered as a result of fraternity ceremonial rituals, as at least one student dies every year since 1970,” said Douglas Fayerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this is an important step by the authorities.
Monroe jury counties have inclined to accuse the third degree of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against newcomers and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to take responsibility not only for individual participants, but if there is an organization that authorized all of this formally or informally, then for her,” Wagner stated on Tuesday.
The College of Baruch banned brotherhood, and the nationwide brotherhood expelled the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will shrink, bond returns will grow and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before it comes, and how long it's going to last.
In particular for the economy, history has little to say about time.
The recession reached only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for 86 months.
The harshness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
Therefore, the United States Central Bank administration stresses so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise rates but on how much adaptation will take.
Actually, there's a lot of variables in the game.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that the whole fusion around the increase in rates is overstated.
“The first increase in rates by the Federal Reserve, with the coming global financial crisis, will inevitably be interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the era of cheap money,” said Julian Jessop, the chief specialist in the international economy in capital economics, in his commentary to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates in the United States to a more normal but still low level to be a seismic momentum, which many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Consider how some areas of the economy could react, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the past month or around, expecting a rise in rates may lead to volatility for a time.
However, in increasing the rate, the consequences are not usually such dramatic.
"It is not like that the revenues from shares are halted by 12 to 24 months after the first run, which is again likely to reflect the delay in coinary policies," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the increases in rates by the Federal Reserve.
More precisely, the market is more likely to change - some 14 per cent more in the past 35 years - towards higher rates - within 250 days of that time (a average increase of 2.6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to a normal rate of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dol, the Chief Equator for the Nuveen Asset Management Strategy, published in Barron's.
In Deutsche, it is said that the results for securities tend not to become more pronounced at the rate increase stage immediately, and the revenues from shares are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that did not exist before and could expedite recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at the lowest point during the lifetime of an elevated rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of higher rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 per cent.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe that it is long, while in the third quarter it is only 1.5 per cent, according to Atlanta Fed.
Increased rates on such a fragile economic background could be risky and posed a question of “whether this time it would be different”, reported in Deutsche.
Market participants are preparing for an increase in the rates of the Federal Reserve System throughout the year, with their views stemmed from the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in the rates at the meeting, fucher trade only suggests a 25 per cent probability.
"In our study since 1950, all the rate increase cycles to this day have been in a supercyclopedia of increasing financial lever at GDP, fracturing the bee that runs the recession very quickly after the recovery begins," says the report.
In contrast, this was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest one that the Federal Reserve system has waited since the end of the last recession; the record is 35 months, which lasts 74 months and is not yet over.
Fixed income has also become unstable while the market expects higher rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to the one being implemented for shares.
The fundamental difference is that bonds will have more effect than shares when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the bond increase cycle, the return rate is immediately dropping”, reports Deutsche.
Charles Schwab ' s strategy specialists believe that increasing rates will lead to a close increase in the income levels of long-term and short-term bonds, making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds are often better off in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of income fluctuations”, says the study of Kathy Jones, a fixed income analysis in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal System's policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflationary expectations, there are indications that the market has led to a more stringent coinary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates for short-term loans have risen, the revenue curve is more flat, the credit span has widened, the volatility has increased - all market characteristics, while the federal system's policies are tightened.
In general, businesses in the United States will benefit from higher interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be in a worse position, as the growing dollar makes their production more expensive in the world market space and their debt more expensive in financial terms.
"Story shows that "quality" shares demonstrate efficiency above the market within three months of the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the customers' report.
Companies with a stable financial condition have been outdated by companies with instability on the basis of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
High capital-income companies, as well as low-volatile shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, an average of 4 (percent points) and 3 (percent points) respectively.
The debt will become a big question.
High-percent debt companies will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to pure exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a growing dollar.
The contributors could also see profits because of higher returns, although experts differ in how fast this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 - Copies of Classic FM” - approves a member of Parliament from Conservators Andrew Bingham
Member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham criticized the station for “Decrease of Standards”
It proves that it is becoming less different from a commercial competitor.
Also targeted at BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize was just ashamed of Brits.
Damien Collins, Parliamentary Collins, who was attacked by the Voice with the same criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 turns into Classic FM," said the parliamentary leader, inviting the TV to prove that she does anything that commercial companies do not do.
A member of Parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham also stated to BBC leadership that it seems that the public radio is "slumbering" and is becoming increasingly different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems to be -- I don't like to use the word "simplification" -- but it seems to turn into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards award launched last December.
BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under another name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that you're the first to come to my mind in which you're actually just copying what you're already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General BBC rejected the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial rival when it concerned living music and the education of the audience.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anymore.
And his loyalty to live speeches and the creation of music is really no match to anyone else.
"It's also very important, I think, the interest of Radio 3 in finding new music and moving up new works," he said.
Previously this year the BBC manager of Radio 3 Alan Davey argued that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child BBC who had been attacked for attacking the heels of commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
A member of the Parliament from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice -- a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media for an indicative price of £22 million.
You see why this programme is often discussed because there are no originalities and differences?
Lord Hall argues that BBC 1, in which Paloma Fait and Boy George participates as judges, was done in the “typical BBC style”.
He added that he wanted the Corporation to find the "hat in its own househouse" next time she starts a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to obstruct the order of the new seasons of The Voice in the future or to use the money of those who pay the licence fees to other entertainment formats.
The growth of the Internet sales was as slow as possible in August, and that could be the Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7 per cent increase in online sales
The past month has seen the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales were intensified three years ago by the use of mobile hepping devices
The experts are convinced that November Black Friday could help to deter costs
For about ten years, a virtual shepping has experienced a boom, transforming many central streets into ghost cities in Britain.
However, experts say that there are now signs of equivalence in online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total cost of online chopping in August showed a minimum increase since they began to be recorded in 2000, only by 5 per cent.
Experts say that there are now signs of equivalence in online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7 per cent increase during the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always found a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that the online sales were intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were given the opportunity to buy online, and they could do so under any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it's on the plate, and you can see the declining.
The Black Friday phenomena, who came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slow sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying prior to the event that took place in the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers, five times the average, rushed to computers to make good use of profitable proposals, thereby destroying a number of sellers ' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter the real battle for profitable purchases, could make people refrain from spining.
According to a study published by British Retail Consortium, a little over £1 out of every 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as television and washing machines, more than one third of them are sold through Internet stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online are more readily available than in fashion shops in central streets.
Muslims buried the crane in Mecca while Ben Laden's family was sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead on the streets as the first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also traumatized after the crane was damaged
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the streets flew to bury 29 of the victims who died as a result of the tap attack on the main mosque of Mecca.
The white ones dressed mainly at the funeral were filled with a carriageway to pay tribute to the first of the dead who went on their last journey to the al-Moaisem cemetery.
The grim procession passed by a sacred place where, for just a few days earlier, the building crane smashed the mosque ceiling and fell to the parishioners.
The bodies were issued for funeral, and at the same time, King Saudis fined the construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
Bodies 29 of those who died in the tap of the main mosque were carried on the streets
Among the deaths were the father of Casim Akram of Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane.
Mr. Akram was in the Chief Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group was not supposed to leave a tap shot lifted at a non-working crane.
The Arab version of the decree issued by the State Agency of Saudi Press states that Binladin Group is partially guilty of the offence.
The English edition of the news agency did not describe this detail but reported that company leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane into the chief mosque court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were leaping into the hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the tap damage, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also charged the company with the non-use of modern security measures and inappropriate harmonization with the Meteorological Service.
Tens of crowns are surrounded by the Mecca Main Mosque, as part of the extensive construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
The ben Laden family has been among the nearby Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades and has led the largest construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al-Qaida Usama bin Laden was a change-born son who rejected the family in the 1990s.
The accident took place during the heavy winds and rain just a few days before millions of people arrived in the Kingdom to participate in pilgrimage, which is compulsory at least once in the life of every working Muslim.
Officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about £174,000) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount was irreversible.
The survivors will receive half that amount.
Chapter B&Q states that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for small money.
According to Veronica Laurie, British are increasingly hiring repair professionals.
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Result - Opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief Urban Correspondent Daily Mail
It is said that the British defer to hammers and malls and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do house work
If you can treat the hammer or make the walls nice, it seems that you are in a minority today.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, British are doing more than hiring master professionals to do easy homework.
Veronique Laurie, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns a house service network, reported that this trend is followed by a significant increase in skilled masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in master's goods, while closing 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Laurie said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shop staff, as eight out of ten shopping decisions are made by the weaker sex representatives.
At present, most staff are men.
She said that the recent demographic trends that were characterized by an increase in the number of single-women households that were more engaged in housing than in the past.
Ms. Laurie said, "Our shops are still predominantly males.
Steps should be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on the goods acquired are taken by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of the five women whose shares are recorded in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team by reaching the equal number of men and women directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 per cent of managers are women, including the Director General and Finance.
Ms. Laurie said, “It was a deliberate decision, diversification was an important issue for us.
It was easy to find suitable women in the board of directors.
After the group took over the cost of closing the stores, Kingfisher showed a decrease in profits and sales for six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time to take a decision at the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is monitoring a meeting by the Federal Reserve Bank, at which the most important decision is to raise or not the interest rate for the first time in the last decade is discussed within two days.
The Reuters survey of 80 economists found that a little over half of those who believed last week that the Federal Reserve would do so now believe that it would still delay and maintain the rate at the current 0-0.25 per cent range.
This is a historic event, since it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching that the main bank can move from zero to start the normalization of interest rates”, said Angel Ubide, leader of the Institute of the International Economics of Peterson.
The US economy works effectively, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore the impact of the decision on the world economy.
He warned the markets that we should prepare for changes, but everyone said they were confident that all the chances were against that step.
The decision will be announced at 20 a.m. on Thursday.
New Balkan route: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" scandals hundreds of refugees at the Horgosh checkpoint at the Serbian-Hungarian border.
From Tuesday Budapest closed the border for displaced persons.
Asylum-seekers are already beginning to search for other versions of the routes to the European Union.
One of them, along the closed border with Serbia, lies across Romania.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, to Austria.
According to some data, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The drivers were ordered by the authorities to proceed without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior of Neboysha Stepanović assures that his country is doing its utmost to help refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our work is to protect Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But it's already a Pan-European problem.
It is difficult to resolve, and no single country in Europe will do so, and especially a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open a border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban is steadfast:
If someone is called a refugee, in Serbia he has to fill in the documents he needs.
And if he doesn't do that, he'll never be let go to our country because it's safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already raised a 175-tilinerometer fence at the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop at this: he intends to raise the same barrier at the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
"Europe wants to help us."
The Envoy of Meimarakis has been part of the law-enforcement governments that, in the view of the left-wing country, have led the country to a financial crisis over a number of years.
Now he, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, is challenging Cipras.
A few days before the elections, he met a journalist, Evronius.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to Euronoyus!
Thank you for your invitation.
Evronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat by retreating the SIRIZA coalition, but now, according to surveys, the New Democracy was compared to it by popularity.
What has changed during that time?
- Greece changed, and we too.
Mr. Cipris lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece had a surplus of the budget and prospects for economic growth.
The country now again has a fiscal deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Cipras had driven them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks had an opportunity to assess the situation in January and the false promises of Mr. Cipras.
And now they can easily compare what is promised with what has actually happened.
The daily life has become worse than in January, when the situation has improved, with most Greek citizens concerned.
Evronius: But you say that in the event of election victory, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SIRIS.
The point is, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme they have agreed on without refusing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I strongly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronius: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cipris and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new premier on Monday, will you comply with this agreement, or will you try to change it at least partly?
In fact, we voted for the Greek movement in the European way, because we're well aware of the destructive consequences of the country's withdrawal from the EU.
Europe now helps us by subsidizing our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Junker package and aid in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there hadn't been a European contract.
But the current measures of stiff savings have resulted from Mr. Cipris leading negotiations.
I know Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government, during the first year, wants to establish order, operates rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because of bringing the recession back to the negotiations, but only after a certain time.
It would be mistaken to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they look forward to the full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, continuing to enjoy the benefits of EU financing and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the course of the negotiations, the Government of Cipras did not provide any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have clarified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I could give an example of farm income.
We explained to our European partners that this was not a fixed monthly income, and he could not be taxed fully in advance.
We were told that the Ministers of Cipras had never said that.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and were not well informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and concluded a failed agreement.
If you win the election, you'll be at one table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Mrs. Mercel and other European leaders.
Will what you say to them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Herald Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we tried best to implement the 2012 agreement by circulating the sharp corners of it.
We have made progress in reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we were acting in emergency circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers ready to pay the price of the Greek government.
I was then a Speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the Government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations from outside.
We were able to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections resulting from the December presidential elections.
Euronoyus: In the last weeks, a massive flow of refugees has flown across Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of European countries to which these people are seeking?
The crisis with refugees is a bomb of slow action that we have to deal with after the election won.
The reason is that the SIRIS Government has not acted in this situation as it should have been.
Such issues should be addressed in advance, because if the problem strikes you, only emergency measures remain.
And we are in that situation now.
Even the interim government that changed SIRIZ had done more in just seven days than Mr. Cipras had done in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the interim Government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called on the EU summit, will be able to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and notice that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that took place with them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian dimension, and we will adhere to the position that European policies must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU Summit, and the United Nations should also be involved.
We also need better coordination, better border controls and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance received from the EU to address this pressing problem.
Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Thank you.
In the peace town of Dracovka Donetska, for the rest of the day, criminal investigation officers of the Department of Police, together with the military counterintelligence, installed and detained a suspect who had been a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the town of Crevaya Rog (Dnepropetrov), who had been shot out of his gun at his opponent the night before.

A man who opened a shooting at the University of Delta left a note of apology
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was “regretting” on the first murder and would like to “return everything back” on Tuesday.
The police in Gothya, Mississippi, reported that the professor of geography and social science at the University of Delta, called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
The Lamb told the manager that the police should send people to his home.
He said, "Yesterday, I killed my wife," and he also mentioned that there is a "bird" in the house that is "no one touched" but is probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he didn't call him.
The Lamb did not explain why he opened the shooting.
Upon arriving at the crime scene, the police found Amy Prentis' body, 41, and a hand-writing note from Lamb, 45 years old, saying, "I wish I could turn it back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a teacher of history, and killed himself on Monday night, when he was surrounded by the police.
Rector William Laforge reported that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something in mind."
Despite the information on Monday that Lamb was envisioned as an affair between Prentis and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday “no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
The Prentis was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Stin, who reported that he was married for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Stin told me he and Prentis had a daughter who had a 19, and that she was "disappointed."
He added that Prentis and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Noulz, who St. Herald calls her close friend Prentis, the last one worked from home on the Internet.
Noulz told me Prentis had a hunting dog called Laitning, and she met Lamb for about three years.
Noulz said, "She's always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the relatives on Monday at some point to say, "He won't go to jail."
The same night the police caught him on a highway "1" near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of her, fled into the woods and shot.
According to a summary on the university website, in spring 2015, Lamb received a PhD degree at the University of Delta.
Stars Lost Their Happiness
The acter (left), in photographs with his son Redmond (right), has survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-term companion, Farra Fosesett, who died of cancer.
The actor was also reportedly suffering from drug dependence, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
This has certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United for a few months because of a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right foot in two places during the Champion League match where Manchester United lost PSV in Einhowen.
While the defence counsel is concerned about this subject, which prevents him from entering the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in that season.
A trauma occurred during the reckless subcategory of Hector Moreno for the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV fine.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before taking to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or afternoon later and then operated.
It's awful -- a young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame his hardships and played fantasticly, and here it happened.
There was a oxygen mask on it in the garbage.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy won't be able to play the group stage.
I hope he can play this season again.
Morono's lucky he didn't get a red card and he wasn't assigned the toolbars.
Arbitr Nicolas Rizzoli didn't punish Mexicans.
Van Gal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
So judge yourself when I say it's worth a toolbar and a red card.
It was a very bad booze from two legs.
In his Twitter, Shaw writes, "Thanks everyone for your messages, don't tell me how I'm devastated, my way to recovery starts, I'll come back stronger than I was."
On the other hand: Manchester United is in distress with Luc Shaw when the PSV game is defeated
The British defender will have an additional incentive to recover from the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Coke, PSV coach, said, "It's a very heavy trauma."
When any player gets that kind of trauma, everybody's really upset about it.
This has never been the intention of our players to traumatize the adversary.
Morono's leg shifted when he played Mexico against the Dutch team under Van Gal's leadership at the 2014 World Championship.
"He's very hard now because he didn't intend to hurt an enemy, and when you hear that it's a very heavy trauma, you feel bad," said Koku.
I couldn't see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked like he touched him, but I didn't see a crack under Luke.
In a discussion with SBS6 Morono, he said, "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure it.
I'm very tough, and I'm sorry.
Andrez Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about "Loraks"?
Every parent is very quick to learn one thing: If your child likes a book, it's going to take a while before you know it almost.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
Responding to a question raised by the representative of a vacation company about his beloved child book, the Prime Minister chose “Lorax”, a ecological story written by Dr. Suz in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment on the SuperCamps website, and continues, "This is a fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message, I love to read to my children because it always reveals any image or message that we miss."
And it's good, except for the last paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to rewrite the content of the book, but actually tells the story of a single-named film taken in 2012, with new characters and details added to make a rather brief original story.
"In the high walls surrounded by the city of All-Numberville, where there was no greenness and even the air was sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of her dream, by fulfilling her desire to see the present tree," we read in the text a description of the love story unknown to Dr. Suz (the real name of Theodore Suzel), who died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious, Cameron's text is read almost as a summary of the "Lorax" film on the Internet Movie Database, "In the high walls of the city of All-Number, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, the boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of her dream."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, by being generally recognized as an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by the greedy cutter of trees and the perpetrator of the Nashkins, despite the protests of Loracs (whose name is called the book), is a funny creature with a mustache that “speaks on behalf of the trees”.
This simple PR task was likely entrusted to the author who never read to the child a book about Loracs 20 consecutive times.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was allegedly received from the Cameron office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text had been received from the headquarters of Cameron, but no further comments had been made.
For Adam Lith obviously had a risk of not getting into the assembly of England, but it's still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a challenge, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the repeat of the 3-0 test series, which has happened last time, does not seem likely to me.
I would not have ruled out the victory in my field either.
Alister Cook's team may be less experienced than the one that was three years ago, but there are players, virulently taking twisted balls, and collective thinking very much; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only a youth's position.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a bulwark that gives a twisted ball, and Adil Rashid, even if he's an unknown figure for a test level, is an attacking option.
Still on the subject: Adam Lit left England's collection on a test scream and replaced by Alex Hayles.
The decision to exclude Adam Lita to me, his main coach in Yorkshire, of course, is hard to analyse.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but violent reality was that the cries were evaluated by the judges on the basis of the outcome.
There was no question about John Ruth, for example, what led to this announcement, because (and I've said this before) players are best chosen for themselves.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could wait for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there's another opportunity.
Trevor Bayliss, the chief collector of England, spoke well about his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and that's not surprising to me; he's first of all a commander and then everything else.
The question is, how long will it take, before the betsman of the test cricket leaves the impression, a difficult question.
Lit played seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play his own field.
The only thing you can say is that England chose Jonathan Trotta for the Caribbean Prime League when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
It's Alex Hayles, and he's a betsman, who I'm highly esteemed.
He's an unpredictable cricketist, which we saw at the Yorkshire Club early this season, when he earned 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge Square, which was something.
It should at least be given the same opportunity as those before it, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
The thought of putting Moena next to Cook as an open-minded beetsman, which would allow for the introduction of an additional backer by keeping four fast-speed boolers, is pondering, and I don't mind it at all.
I don't see the reasons why the beater can't hit the ball there, and the left-hand one has already shown him to be a fucking good cricketist.
Mons may not be exactly what's needed for his Woostershire County, but he became the third number for them, and there's no difference here.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test matches "Three Betsman" before he came out as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once and didn't look around.
Zafar Ansari comes to the assembly as a backup, and with my brief association with him, he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at his sample statistics -- an average of 31 bits and 35 balls -- and think that it's a risk rate, but among backners who vote for a little, and who select youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tour.
In addition to a compendium, England plans to make a few practical additions to the coaching composition.
The appointment of Mahela Jayaouordin, Sri Lankan betsman, as a consultant for test matches, could be a workshop.
He's one of the best guys for the game that will bring her the richest experience gained under all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games in which the white ball is used and will provide both energy and merciless pace.
I have always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether game or coach work, and like Mahela, he has much intelligence.
At times, new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has been said before, can give the team a new force.
The Colly College of Darem Ben Stocks is left for one day, Ruth is given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, have no problem with this.
Although not all agree, the coaches and the players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
The British European Departure Camp can be won if the economy is depressed by 2017
The unthinkable policy of David Cameron to resume negotiations on the preservation of Britain in the EU is increasingly difficult every day, even without looking at the selection of genius Jeremy-"It is yes or not?" - Corbin's leader of the Laborists or TUC's abhorrence over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigel Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat explained on days that, in the situation in which the EU is now facing a variety of crises - not all of them of their own manufacture - some countries on the British egocentric agenda of sowing concessions and subverting agreement on changes that they do not mostly want.
When TUC met at Brighton for an annual meeting, he decided that he did not want them in any case if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the selphie Dave and George programme."
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are катаing at summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves in the background of a known local monument, in or without local celebrity, then coming home and saying that they attract allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who is interested in maintaining external contact with Britain under the tent of the European Union, “Don't leave us with France”, says Berlin, suggests that the defamated ministers and officials in some capitals should reach an understanding when they are all the same, stay or leave.
Angel Mercel, a very cautious chancellor of Germany, is an ally, but she is in power for 10 years and wants to leave her office before the situation for her deteriorates, as it has deteriorated for Tetcher (11 years), Mitterrane (14) and Cola (16).
François Olland, head of France, stands before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland could soon obtain a nationalist government of the right-hand side, Spain left-hand government.
It is hard to see them groaning out of their skin in order to help Selphi Britannica, whose energy could be spent to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain — which they do not want, because most have similar separatist trends.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style receptacles during the British referendum campaign in 2017, in order to get the British out of the EU, my friend envisages.
“The review was an idea of a fix” and “Britia received nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations”.
Europeans are aware of the predator of Flit Street, and as skeptical to the EU, the media magnasts, unlike the Tony Ben's referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 by the ratio 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, a rooted Euro-opportunist who was known by his “direct EU bananas” by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his foolishness, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a hot company from fearful guinea taxes, foreign telephone hackers and non-resident pseudo-non-resident phones that own most of our large newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair was the same for them, but he was aware that when you're in a bumpy gorilla cell, you have to give her bananas to distract her and not let her eat you for lunch and once again with tea.
Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in opposition to Cameron's referendum, since Blar had taken the lead in favour of the revoked EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him.
But the lovely Jeremy Corbin, who kindly stuck me on the back of Westminster on Monday, I told him he had no more time to spend it on me, seems to be at risk of repeating the Nile Kinnok strategy of the "Bycott Murdoku" of the '80s, a mistake and then, and now.
It might take some time, but he has to develop a consistent strategy for interaction with the press -- not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the BBC he was sitting on Sunday.
The official position of Corbin on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He said he would like us to stay in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist trend, Ukip, and a wider range of small England's sides may say yes.
That's the same thing as Hilary-Benn, but not bannit-Benn said on radio and TV this week, and his internal boycout refused to acknowledge that the designation of Corbin as a non-familiar John McDonnel as the “tenen” Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father was fighting hard on TV for being unfair to Liborian colleagues without going too far and without losing his office in the Cabinet of Ministers.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain “in any circumstances” -- Benna's phrase -- was not what McDonnel said, nor was it what J. K. spoke to the pores and members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general view.
In order to notify the Democrat and his boyfriend Corbin -- remember, he touched even me -- the discipline of messages remains important in the century of 24-hour television seven days a week, especially in the waters of social networks, paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron get away from Europe so simply, allowing him to accept as a proper support for liebourists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnel said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But the main misleading of McDonnel and Corbin for EU membership - within the Benni economy of deposition - is no longer the issue of esoteric debate among left dissidents, for which narcissism, born of minor differences, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his mistakes over Nato-Tom Watson, it is unwavering that J.K. will not be agitated for the exit -- foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their managers at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on British concessions when it could be meaningless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government is cutting the costs, which I was reminded of on Monday during the lunch at a British Influence Security forum.
Experts criticize the review of electronic cigarettes from public health in England
The Government-funded Agency's statements that electronic cigarettes are 95 per cent less harmful than smoking were expressed at the meeting by 12 people, some of whom are related to tobacco, as the researchers reported.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) jointly with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health Agency of England (PHE) in their electronic cigarettes report.
PHE published an important report last month, called it "a comprehensive review of evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the validity of the data and indicated the linkage of some experts with tobacco industry.
The editorial in Lancet Medical Journal last month criticized the “extremely ugly argument” on the basis of which PHE constructed its main opinion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers asked whether these statements had “solid or lucrative grounds”.
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Caipwell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The Fundamental Principles of Health - Rules must be based on evidence of efficiency”.
According to them, the public expects that PHE statements that “the best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco smoke” were based on a detailed examination of evidence and modelling.
This is, in fact, the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criterial decision-making model to summarize their views on the harm associated with the various nicotino-positive products; the results of the meeting are summarized in the scientific publication.
McKy and Capwell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was EuroSwiss Health, whose Director-General reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had previously received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the election of members of the Board, but there were several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of whom also stated that the industry was financed in publications.
It is unknown whether other participants have experience with tobacco management.
The PHE leader also visited the PHE meeting.
The scientific article published by the group “exemplaryly agrees” that there is a lack of “provided evidence of the harmful effects of most products on most criteria” by McKi and Caipwell.
However, none of these links and constraints were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Caipwell reported that PHE claims that “no evidence is at present that electronic cigarettes are expensive leading children or non-smoking” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of PHE health and well-being, said that the BMJ statements had previously been answered.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking."
One of the two smokers died all his life because of their addiction.
All evidence implies that health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what proves and what does not prove these evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people per year die of smoking-related diseases, while smoking costs $2 billion a year.
Clearly denoting that, although electronic cigarettes are not safe, they only do part of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our tasks before the nation.
The former chapter of Channel 4 believes BBC should stop the EastEnders series.
The former chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop producing programs like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would have given much for such successful shows as the soap opera on Albert's "Please."
Johnson noted that licence fees should be used only to create programmes that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized BBC for putting public broadcasts, which are likely only a small part of the audience, at a peak ether time when competitors have high rating shows, and on channels like BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he, in his time for six years, failed to cooperate with BBC during his work on Channel 4.
"I can't separate myself from the thought that BBC is preparing for launch and broadcasting transfers that could show competing companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords as part of further exploration of BBC's destiny.
If you keep the licence charge that I don't consider a good decision in the medium and long term, then companies should leave the air only those programs that are not released and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice shows up in the air in the air, because the creators want the best possible support for the future.
The idea that no one should show him again is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be financed by gears that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; we know they're their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly have given much for her.
I don't understand how this can be public broadcasting.
I don't think it would humiliate BBC.
The Serial Entrepreneur Johnson, headed by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of ratings because of staff ambitions and their belief that it is the best way to obtain long-term support.
His comments on the most popular BBC show are clashed with comments by the Executive Director of Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his 2003 lecture of McTaghart's memory in Edinburgh, offered BBC to sell an EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that the more nichotic BBC transfers of a public character " continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but that the function of the company has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Jange sermons justifying the proceeds of 4 billion pounds of licence: "yes, of course, we are doing all these imprecise transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
With regard to the licence fee, Johnson informed the Committee: “I call on you to find a more regressive system for who will receive the most.
Of course, you all think we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge sum, but for people with 150 pounds of money, I wonder, they think so because they're not watching and listening to BBC.
The former Sky and Channel Executive Director, David Elstane, who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should review Rita's mission in favour of “inform, educate and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small portion of BBC material is now formally classified as educational, according to him, 1 per cent of television content and 0.1 per cent on radio, and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasting companies under the motto “information, education and entertainment”.
In the area of partnership, Elstane noted that BBC should make more efforts in areas such as “Replace concerts” (only part of them appears on TV), as well as joining alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available online.
The Sonogenetics allows the brain cells to operate with sound waves.
The video shows how intacts change the direction of movement when they are exposed to sound pulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nerve system that can be manipulated using sound wave spulses.
Low intodes change the direction of movement at a time when they are influenced by sound impulses, too high to be heard by the human ear.
The impulses are influenced by activated neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Also on the subject: Researchers manage the brains by light
Scientists said that worms show the possibilities of a new technique called sonogenetics, the point of which is to use ultrasound to induce certain brains, hearts and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is out of the body.
Szrikant Chalasani, a scientist at the Solka Institute, La Hoya, California, told Guardian that this method could one day replace deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent into the brain and used in Parkinson's disease.
They don't usually react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to react when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that bubbles increase ultrasound waves that then penetrate worms.
Intensified ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in membranes of some worm cells.
The ultrasound waves cause these ion channels to open and incite cells that are connected to them, as reported in the Nature Communications report.
To create a nonmatod that can be managed through ultrasound, Chalasani has made genetic modifications to worms so that their engine neurons used ion channels TRP-4.
During the use of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and entered into worms by activated modified engine neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in the Optogenetics, a new direction that allows scientists to include and switch neurons through light pulses.
Chalaçani argues that there may be some advantages in comparison to this method of sonogenetics.
Unlike light, which is brought to the right section of the brain by optolocolate, low - frequency ultrasound waves pass freely through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to go inside the skull.
“We believe that the use of genetic therapy and therapeutic viruses will enable human neurons to be sensitive to ultrasound signals for treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions,” said Chalasani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising attacks on the British arms trade
See the role of Amnesty International in protesting against the weaponization exhibition.
Shocking killer drones!
Destroying iron candals!
Cassette bombs!
Electrical light-silent tubes causing pain, but not leaving footprints!
The full voice and animation leaves no doubt that this advertising of the largest international exhibition of armaments is an idle parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to “stop” weapons by repressive regimes, using the ExCeL centre in Doklands of defence technology and security systems.
Also on the subject: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes travel to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden arrival of a number of posters on bus stops and trains in subways that require a re-examination of them.
"The important DLR announcement from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of these in the London Metro fonts with a DLR line that turns into a tank's silhouette.
In September this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be on line DLR. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters are painted by artists who put their jobs in the "Musse of Savage Design" in the Banky Park, Dismaland.
A team called "Specific Patrol" has helped to distribute them to London using a six-pound set of hot keys, which is said to "have access to about a third of the advertising space at the bus stops of the planet."
London's transporters were wearisome of such “wandalism” as unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the “Special Patrol” Unit.
According to Gavin Greendon, the Cruel Designs and Teacher of the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to the audience outside the galleries.
Many artists are starting to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their arts if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of arms welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was seen more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by a pro bono VCCP agency, with the involvement of a graphic designer and an artist of sound, also working free of charge.
The Creative Director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the exhibition of arms - with an exCel calendar - and thought, "Let's make them a campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and crafty corporate advertising, but "to fill her home with bright colors and animations was more exciting."
"They have incredibly helped us to draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment on the exhibition," says Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and to ensure that these drinking equipment will not be illegally sold right at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art of arms exhibition is from within ExCeL, where participants trade fantasticly euthemetic products.
The Saab press release revealed an order for the "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the U.S. Army.
It includes “non-subjected cumulative warhead, which brings unprecedented ground in the target”.

Eight golden rules of residence in student lodgings
It's been 11 years since I moved to school as a normal 19-year-old person who still believes in taking and moral relativism, but just now I remember the strained smiles of those I've been irritating -- and many long, complaints against others.
Basically, what I've learned can be laid down by eight simple rules.
Moves to the dorm may vary from slightly active to completely frightening.
He wants to talk to people from where you took your academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin and why you're "fastly, I don't like or hate "Marmait," because, seriously, guys, it's just the trembling excitement of HAHAHA, I'll be with me."
Take a breath.
And help others break up, too, ask questions and show interest.
This keeps the conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those you wouldn't even talk to, even if you had the rice burned, and they would give out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often transformed into dietary institutions, monthly film halls and common rooms, but they are also the place where people dress and refrigerate underwear.
On the other hand: Don't even think about starting a university in a relationship
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room must be a haven, but many dorms form a culture of confusion from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, association and long friendship.
It could be hell for someone who tries to rebuild power.
There's nothing in culture that lets you say, "I like you, and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave, and I've been able to recover the energy that I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel when the coach's tired of communicating and not knocking on it, but sending the SMS.
By the way, about the knocking: do it.
One guy in my company followed the principle that if the door was not locked, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
Make friends with a baking.
Since you start a university life at the peak of Bake-Off show, you start knocking on the doors to present and present a plate of chocolate cookies, it's not that strange, it's not like the 1950s, "Welcome, We're Neighbors, I've got something, and now smile, and I'm gonna ask you personal questions."
It's a good way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and your face will eventually be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good you're a baker.
Badly blinded bats of flour, sugar and fat will make people look sleepy when you knock on them.
The thievery of food is a typical crime in student dorms.
Of course, kidnapping someone's chicken is a thief, but is it a thief to take a little milk for tea?
Get out of the milk owner.
He's probably going to invite you not to be shy, even if he's boiling out of anger inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and I'm sympathizing with you, but try to take this adulter than my neighbor, who poured in her milk liquid to wash the dishes to vengeance those who took it without demand.
She's in prison now.
You don't have to make noises that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you're the same people in the glass houses.
The girl in my corridor asked her neighbor to remove the sound of the drums and bas guitars, because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an examination in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she mercifully allowed him to sleep for two hours and then cut down her music and locked the door behind her, starting a three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if your prospective mate had settled in the same company as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extreme, before you bite the elbows, uncomfortable if you were to take a neighbor for your future mate, take care of them, break up the relationship, and see him every day, and maybe see how he's dragging all your common friends on his side?
Of course, you can't tell your heart, but if the hot neighbor is not exactly your future mate, try to cool your own dust a little bit.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone left the keys inside his own locked room, the line between the playground and the grass is thiner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns out to be the opposite in seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting lesson in safety, hiding something, but never pack someone's toothpaste room and champagne.
Put the keys in a glass of water in front of a stranger's door, and then put them in the ice cream, but don't stick other things with Blu-Tack's glue to the ceiling more than two times.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on iPhone after an update from Apple
The new operating system can be requested in the Settings application to select General and then the Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error report appears saying that “the application has failed to regenerate”.
To avoid this, users are encouraged either to wait until the recovery is halted or to try to update through iTunes.
Telephone tips will allow you to go through the process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the space, but Apple minimized the probability of this action by reducing the level of update, and also simplified the implementation by a special tool which proposes to remove the annexes and reinstate them after the process has been completed.
It is to be sure that when you update your phone is loaded or is near the charger to prevent the battery from running.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update because the phone's discharge in the process can lead to a failure to update.

IOS 9 now includes new functions, including improved personal assistant, and innovations that increase the productivity of iPad, as well as adjustments that increase performance and correct the operating system.
Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergey Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support that Moscow provides to President Asad only leads to an aggravated conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House isn't going to talk to a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrova, to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported in the PJ Media publication.
“The secretary of Carrie made it clear that the further support of President Asad from Russia poses a risk of aggravating and extending the conflict, and also has a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism, if we also do not continue to focus on finding solutions to the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power,” said the representative of the U.S. State Department.
They also noted that Kerry had once again stressed the United States ' commitment to combating the Islamic State in a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of it.
In addition, the U.S. “will be pleased with the constructive role of Russia in trying to resist the Islamic State”.
Last Friday, representatives of the White House stated that they did not know exactly what the Russian forces were doing in Syria, but Washington was about to discuss the issue with Moscow.
After all, Josch Ernest, Spokesman for the White House, noted that the time for telephone conversation between President Barak Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, had not yet come: “When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit us, then he will pick up the tube and try to make the call.”
Barak Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for Asad's regime as a “winning rate”.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that Asaad's continued support would only worsen the situation.
“But he did not heed my warnings, and the situation deteriorated,” said the U.S. President.
Smuggled yachts will free the payment of customs duties.
Minor economic development intends to temporarily free the imported yachts and other recreational and sports flows from customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of concessional goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry on instructions from the Government of the RF.
The Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Laskin, reported to the Investigators.
In June 2015, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev commissioned a number of departments - Min Economy Development, Mintrans RF, Mintranculture, MID, MCS, FSB, FTA, Rosturism - to prepare proposals to create an enabling environment for Iachting in the country's coastal zones.
In turn, experts note that the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of the yacht is a major problem.
The owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - about 200 million € per year go to the European States for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of the yacht.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs of Russia prepared a draft decision by the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission for Europe on the modification of the list of goods temporarily imported with full reliance on customs duties, taxes, providing for full conditional exemptions from customs duties, taxes for imported boats and other recreational and sports instruments.
In the view of the Ministry, this would undoubtedly contribute to creating an enabling environment for the development of Yachting in the country's coastal zones, noted Laskina.
This issue was presented to the Subcommission on Customs, Non-tariff Regulation, Protection in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission for Economic Development and Integration, which was held in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies following the discussion.
As noted by the representative of Min Economy, the proposed measure for full conditional release on importation is essentially a concession.
Therefore, after the adoption of the protocol, the meeting of the subcommission in the Government of the Russian Federation, Min Economy, will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EEA member States, explained to Laskina.
The list of importable goods that are totally exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes includes goods necessary to assist external economic activities and international cooperation, for use in science, culture, cinema, sports and tourism, for international assistance, and other such goods include service equipment (personal computers, writing machines), gauges, drilling equipment, scenery suits and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skiing, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, music tools and objects for religious rituals.
In the Mintrans RF, Izvetiam press service, it was reported that binding orders had been issued on seaports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodocia and Euratoria, which provided for the simplification of the process of setting and exit of small, sporting sailing and recycling vessels to the seaport.
The Mintrans are assigned to the captains of the Krym seaports to ensure that small, sporting sailing and recreational vessels are simplified in the seaport and that the vessels listed from the seaport are ships.
Mintrans also prepared drafts of government orders by the RF to approve the borders of the Krima seaports.
With regard to Yalta and Theodosia, the orders have already been issued, the rest are in the process of harmonization, noted in the press office of the department.
In the opinion of Mintrans, the State Inspector, Classification and Inspection, the Republic of Crem and Sevastopol should carry out the registration of small vessels used for non-profit purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it's very difficult for yachting to do because of poorly developed infrastructure.
Looking south of Italy and France, it is a steadily developing industry with a large number of people.
In Russia, though, everything is on the ground.
Our coast is small, the only piece where the yachts can be exploited round a day is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Helenjik, Norossiski, Anapa.
But the biggest challenge is that in this area, the strict rules of the border service are very strict: to get out on the yacht, you have to make a lot of permits.
And inside Russia, there's nowhere to get rid of it.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then she has a problem where to get it, says Nordmarine Denis Novikov, sales director.
With regard to yacht storage sites, there are now special yacht hangars in Moscow and St. Petersburg to 30 metres. The yachts are also deposited in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers were rich people, but with the beginning of the crisis, the demand for yacht fell.
The World Bank has allocated Ukrainian credit to $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for financial sector development.
This was reported by the press service of an international organization.
“New funding will support a number of priority banking sector reform measures in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine”, the report states.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Zimiao Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help restore credits in a real economy and stimulate recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and that the World Bank had witnessed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of Fan's problems, the Government of Ukraine is calling for an acceleration of reforms.
Previously, the Polish Government approved the loan in Ukrainian €100 million, transmits the RIA Newsty.
In prisons, they are asked to establish separate units for transgender.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Penal Enforcement Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of setting up separate blocs for transgenders and transvestites in colonies.
The Vladislaw Grib, a member of the Council, described this.
In his view, depending on the total number of convicts who were not sexed in Russia, it was possible for domestic prisons to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such offenders) to create a special colony for transgenders.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine whether citizens will be sentenced to such isolated places only after the convicted persons have taken appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the perpetrator is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the remaining penalties.
He said that the proposed practice was successful abroad: the IDF (where the accused were before the court decision) provided separate cells for transgenders and special units in correctional institutions.
Today, it's the only way to work with such criminals.
Unequivocally, they need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgenders in ordinary cells is dangerous to them, which is the suffering of their families and the sea of problems for FSIN staff.
The humiliation of trances on the part of the cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on the size of a large city, the number of offenders with an uncertain gender must also be calculated where to distribute them.
SIZOs are not exactly needed - only cameras, prison blocks.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
According to the Grib, 50 or 100 persons may be in the block, and if a specialized body is established in Russia alone, transgender prisoners will be able to serve their sentences from any region.
Citizens are held at the scene of the crime, so transferees or transgenders from other actors are unrealistic in the course of the investigation and trial, and the introduction of such practices for already convicted persons in a separate colony - yes, - considers Gribe.
Recall that the law enforcement officials had not previously been able to decide which male or female detention facility to determine the drug-sustaining person for 24-year-old transgender Dmitry Koжукov (known as Alin Davis) had not been arrested.
He was released home under a subscription on a non-departure.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as the transgender system in SISO and the colonies in Russia is not yet available.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT movement activist (LGBT, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nicolas Alexeyev supported the idea of setting up special places to serve the punishment by transgenders, noting that there is also a possibility of identifying people in colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, like the security issue for homosexuals, says Alexeyev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially in prisons more than transgenders.
However, Alexeyev doubts that there will be a lot of citizens in Russia who are willing to betray themselves for transcexuals in order to get to a different location from the usual colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be instituted before putting people in a transgender colony, but not always unambiguous.
For example, in the United States, one of Chelsea Manning’s prisoners looked like a man, and he said in prison that he wanted to change the sex, said Alexeiev.
A person may feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate places to serve sentences for transgenders, I doubt that the prison staff will think seriously about the safety of such people and take into account the simplicity of their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the RF, Boris Lordkipanidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexuals in the colony could severely delay the commencement of sentences by convicted persons.
The commission is created - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists are conducting long-term observations, and it is not one test based on high-quality confinement.
Today's psychiatric opportunities allow this to happen.
And so before the change of sex, potential patients are always doing this -- they're exactly showing whether a change of sex with surgical intervention is the necessary measure, says Lordkipanidze.
However, I find it difficult to imagine how this system is being implemented with respect to convicted persons, for on average, the month is on the basis of this survey.
The doctor, although generally supported the idea of establishing separate transgender blocks, also doubts that, in the current economic environment, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new facilities, medical expertise, transgender units in Russia.
It's hard to count, no official statistics, but if you consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, you can say that transgenders are even smaller, and those who have such a rejection and yet commit crimes are a very small number, said Lordkipanidze.
At present, on application to the administration of the colony of homosexuals and transgenders can receive separate conditions of detention.
Michael Antipole won a youth championship of the world on chess.
In Hanta Mansiski, the chess championship of the world among the young men is under 20 years old.
The end was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and he became Russian Mikhail Antipole, who was able to catch the Jan-Kshistof Dudou Polish, who was kind of confident about his title.
The girls were celebrated by the Ukrainian chessman Natala Bux.
The chess chess champion, held in Hanta Mansiski from the beginning of September, at the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all of the intrigue, as the representative of Poland, Jan-Kshistof Doud, who gave a series of four wins (the Swiss system is held in 13 tours), confidently seized leadership.
In view of the fact that Douda was an rating characteristic of the primacy, yes, and is generally considered to be one of the most promising young chessists, the likelihood that he would miss the extracted break was very small.
And even when Douda dropped the turns and allowed the Russiansman Michael Antypov to reduce the backlog to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favourite in the struggle for title.
The Antypo had to win the 13th tour to catch up with the leader.
But even that wouldn't help, win the Doud's party.
Plus, this imperative of victory, of course, could have had an impact on the Russian chess game and led to necessitative mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipole was able to avoid them.
He had to deal with Francesco Rambaldi confidently, after which he had to wait for his party to complete the Doud meeting Benjamin Bok.
Fortunately, for Antipas, the Polish chessist erupted against a Dutch man.
Thus, Antipole and Douda obtained an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible ones, but Antypov had the best additional indicators.
It is for that reason that the leadership of the Hanta-Mancia Autonomous District, whose Governor Natalia Komarov, has traditionally given high priority to the development of chess in the region, has given him a major prize.
There's no intriguing ending in the girls' competition.
The leader of the tournament, Natale Buxé (Ukraine), was not able to lose his title in the last tour, which she had succeeded.
So Alina Biwall's victory prevented her from catching up with Bux.
The Russian athlete remained the second with a championship of 0.5 points.
It changes the regional structure.
The company joins the Privolz and Ural regions in one of the major Walzco-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East in the East region.
The draft will be completed by 1 November.

Igor Artemev, head of FAS, stated that the department against indexing 10 per cent of freight tariffs and the provision of hospitals, as requested by the OAO.
They wanted 17% indexing first, now they want 10%, and they want multi-million-bundle subsidies from the budget, he says --
We say that it's wrong, it's too much, it's too much to reduce your costs, you're learning to save, you're not giving up expensive specialists, soccer teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS had its own, “proportionately more stringent” proposals, which were under discussion in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. Instead of performing a total $300 million post for shares, the gold extractive company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru to $80 million (the difference between the Sumeru share price and market catings), which can be taken from free cash flows.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to implement the option or to require extra payments.
The details of the Polymetal negotiations do not reveal.
The option was concluded as part of the Polymetal project “Kisil” in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Ministry of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CB, was developing a sanction order for the developers.

The auction will begin in the city of Kalabas on 29 September, with three black versions of the scenario, the estimated cost of each of which is $20-30,000, and AP.
The first of the drafts, written in 1940 by Herman Mankevice, is the earliest scenario in private collections?
The second draft is a more complete version of the scenario, the third is the final plan of the film.
Minproduce: targeted food aid will not be the same as cards in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce of Russia, Victor Eutugov, reported that the targeted food aid programme would not be the same as the food distribution card system in the USSR.
These include modern targeted food assistance to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the food card.
It would be particularly important to note that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the backlog of the total deficit, the distribution card system where the quantity of products received was normal.
In the meantime, we have proposed the concept, if approved, we will propose changes to the law,” the TASS quotes Mr. Eutugow's words.
Previously, the U.S. reported that the programme for the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced to the Government.
For more information on the Minprobor initiative, see “Igor Schalav has commissioned the preparation of food cards”.
The President of Rosgostraha wants to divorce his wife.
The source reported to RAPSI that Daniel Hachaturov, President of the Insurance Company, had filed with the Moscow Court for the dissolution of marriage with the designer Uljana Sergyenko.
The magistrate ' s magistrate ' s magistrate ' s magistrate ' s magistrate ' s trial will begin on 16 September.
Daniel Hachatourov asked for the termination of his marriage and the sharing of the property he had earned together.
The court confirmed that there was a claim to dissolve the marriage in the proceedings, noting that a claim for the separation of property had not been filed and would be pending before the District Court.
President R.D. Alexander Bobresov withdrew.
Alexander Bobres, Vice President of OAO, Russian Railways (RWD), on corporate security, leaves the company, reports Interfax, referring to the source.
The Vice-Primeur of Russia, chairman of the Board of Directors of R.D. Arcadey Parkovich, stated that the issue of the withdrawal from R.D.A. Bóberesov had initiated a new head of Oleg Beloser.
According to the Vice-Primeur, the relocation of staff in management of the RWD is not linked to the change of head of the company.
Previously, the U.S. reported that, instead of Vladimir Yakunin OAO, R.E. was chaired by the first transport paternity minister, Oleg Beloser, who smoked the financial bloc.
For the first time, the new head of the company announced reforms in the monopoly: a new freight tariff system would be established in one and a half years.
For more details on the transformation of the company, see the U.S. "RWC will rewrite the prices."
This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers, Top-1000 Russian Managers, is being conducted at 16 times.
As a tool for evaluating the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for a year by identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the ranking laureates of last year.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for this year ' s rating and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates on the initial list proposes to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies who would be useful to add candidates to the general pool.
The following directors of the company ' s functional areas may be made available: the Director of Finance, the Business Director, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authority, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each expert offers an invitation to the manager to participate in the rating and provides an opportunity to present his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of industry candidates is based on the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and forest-processing industry, machinery, medicine, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and consumer products, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant shall be provided with log and password for login at www.top1000.amr.ru, where they will see information on the remaining participants and may present their assessments as proposed for each functional orientation.
The rating methodology is based on the principle “Better choose the best”: top managers evaluate top managers and functional managers evaluate the functional managers.
This principle allows for the most authentic evaluation of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final ratings are approved at expert commissions meetings.
Eyewitness meetings of expert commissions are invited to all candidates wishing to qualify for this year and many candidates for past years.
The Commissions are organized on a functional basis: a commission to approve the list of senior managers and eight commissions to approve the functions of managers.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (the place is maintained strictly according to the Internet assessment and is closed before the rating is published) or to make an update on their adjustments according to the attached list of standby candidates.
The names of companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the United States.
At the time of publication, the ratings could change the status of managers and companies.
The investment rate is 10-13 per cent.
Experts estimate that the market for small and medium-sized business loans in January to April of this year has reached 40 per cent.
What do you think is the situation today?
Since the panic of the end of 2014 and early 2015, IAS lending has been significantly reduced.
The reason is clear: the sharp rise in interest rates.
25 to 30 per cent of the year's credit was not profitable to anyone.
If the bank had previously been able to place at a higher rate all its potential problems in the future, from delays to non-return, it was now impossible to do so: the rates and so-called veils.
For business, the current level of IAS credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of payability.
The rate of 10 to 13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive income.
How do you estimate that entrepreneurs' demand for credit is met?
The situation has improved slightly after the CB's downsizing of the interest rate.
Loan resources have become more accessible.
However, we have observed that customers have become less accountable for credit.
First of all, business does not understand its development prospects and future incomes.
Today, business has one solution: it is necessary to learn how to work to address today's economic situation in the country and the region.
There is a need to monitor the current results more closely, and to monitor cash flows.
However, if financial resources are available, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, ultimately, enables companies to make products more competitive and to preserve business even in a fragile economic situation.
What major trends in the IAS lending market will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will interest change?
The projection for lowering the average rate will depend largely on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in decreasing the key rate.
However, a radical drop in the IAS credit price should not be expected.
In the current situation, inflation is primarily a problem that makes the necessary interest rate for real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are lowered.
In terms of procrastination, traditionally small- and medium-sized business companies, which are limited to cash replenishment and economic behaviour options, will undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's what the word Mazda is written by Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and simultaneously difficult for those who are used to cyrillic or Latin.
And a new CX-5 crossword, like any other stamp model: without ugliness, attracted outside, technically perfected inside.
Japan's just because of its "Japonism" is able to bring the country of the rising sun's products to a state of complete excitement.
You can make many arguments in favour of cars from other countries, and the person will even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will be followed by the final phrase, "But this is a Japanese car!
There's nothing to argue about!
Such people may have to love not only technology but also all other Japanese.
Citate Base from the course of the basabi food, collect catalogs, and dress your girlfriend -- no, not in kimono, of course, but on the street canons of Japanese fashion: nice, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls enjoy after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and tight.
And the girl is older, the skirt's shorter.
The main change in the appearance of CX-5 is the radiator grid with five horizontal lines.
But the new picture of the headlamps and the rear lamps, where the automobile is instantly detected in the stream of cars, is much more powerful.
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The power is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the outward appearance has a bulk of rigidity.
We don't have to call the police.
CX-5, one of the world's safest, can only be tested by static Japanese tranquillity.
The diesel engine of 2.2 litres provides a high torque in the wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this motor with a capacity of 175 litres per cent to a total of 5.9 litres shall be fitted with an exclusively automatic transmission and full transmission.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
In order to add a little black humor to this image, you can select the legends with a Prince from the Not Cross police tape.
On the other hand, Mazda has made the best effort to keep you from driving the CX-5 in the spot of your own accident.
In order to improve the comfort, with good management, the suspensions restructured the design of front and rear depreciators and optimized the form of the front lower levers.
The full drive system is adapted under Russian conditions.
Road and high speed noise levels are reduced by 13 per cent.
A bather in flowers or stripes is as bored as a budget seat.
It's different if a girl pinches in a bathroom with an original figure.
For example, from a computer game in a role fighter's genre.
She'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both front and rear seats, which provides an optimal reserve of space and for broad shoulders and for long legs who owns it.
Still long - leged people will surely appreciate that the stacks in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and not beaten by ankles in expressions.
The widest set of active security systems of Mazda is proposed for CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to detect a potential threat.
There's also adaptive lighting here, warning about strip climbing, monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in the class.
The less comfortable, with a minimum of presentations, shall contain a load of 561 litres. Rear seats shall be placed in proportions 4:2:4 - each section shall be fitted with a separate lever - and shall increase the baggage compartment to 1,560 litres.
Japan's cartoon hero's suite is called cigurums.
Particularly astonishingly look like pijama cigurms.
Everybody can do it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it's also about entertaining young children.
Or just to walk like that on the street...
Because it's so great when you have the choice of dress, behavior, or car.
Thank you for helping prepare the Kawaicat store.
Kiev broke the atomic unit.
Kyiv formally refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia in the development of Hmelnicka of the ECO.
The Supreme Council voted on Wednesday from the second attempt, however, for the discontinuation of the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the construction of the third and fourth clusters were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to proceed with the project.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law distributing the 2010-2012 agreement with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth bloc on the Hmelnicka of the ESA.
The draft law introduced by the Government was possible only from the second ballot, for the first time it was supported by 210 members, with a minimum of 226, but then 234 votes in favour of the draft.
The original Hmelnic ESC project was to have four 1 GW energy units with VWR reactors but only two have been able to build.
The negotiations with Moscow had led to an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and in 2011-2012, the Council had adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the Ukrainian budget, it was assumed that building blocks would have to be credited to the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the coup d ' état in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of the two Kyiv countries, the relationship with Moscow in the nuclear industry began to be reversed, refusing to cooperate on the Hmelnicka of the ESA and the nuclear fuel plant project in Ukraine.
The only area where relationships persisted was the purchase of fuel in the RF for existing Ukrainian ES (about half of the electricity generation in the country), since the Ukrainian NAEC “Energoat” was still replaced by Russian supplies.
The plans for the development of the Hmelnicka ES with the other contractor in Ukraine have not yet been permanently renounced: as early as 2014, the Czech Skoda JS had been negotiated in Kiev.
UNHSG against the use of military force in the resolution of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, during the press conference, said that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
“No military solution”, AP gives his answer to the question of military support for Syria by Russia.
Mr. Ki-moon also reported that he would meet with the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of the MIND of the permanent members of the UNCS later this month.
"To meet for Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief Henstab of the FAR of Russia, Nikolai Bogdanovski reported that Henstab did not preclude the possibility of the future establishment of an Air Force base in Syria.
There's no such plans yet.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Previously, the U.S. reported that the United States did not trust President Vladimir Putin, who claimed that military assistance to Damascus was necessary to combat the terrorist grouping of the Islamic State banned in the R.F.
For more details on the US doubts regarding Russian assistance to Syria, see the United Nations “Russian Military Presence in Syria Concerns Washington”.
OSCE reports on a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of OSCE Arthur Gerasimov reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
“What I know is that a meeting is scheduled this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations”, quotes Mr. Herasimov's words to the TASS.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreements and the “return to the normal lives of our countries”.
On the question of whether, in his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, in the Normand format or in the form of a contact group on the OSCE area, Mr. Gerasimov, noted that the dialogue was a mine agreement.
At the same time, policy has said that Kyiv supports any kind of dialogue.
Previously the representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the ex-President of the country, Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Republics of Donetca and Lugan had not changed their positions in triangular negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given their mandates.
Yesterday, the Low Novgorod Electoral Commission took stock of the elections to the city departmental district by distributing 12 deputies on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral violations were voiced by CRCR representatives who accused the election of “the oppression of falsifications”.
The opposition ' s observations were not adopted.
The Communists of the Russian Communists also refused to organize a referendum on the lifting of the multi-home quench fees.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections to the proud Lower Novgorod in the municipal electoral district.
A total of 1.03 million voters were included in the lists of voters in Lower Novgorod, 746.7000 ballots were issued to the stationary commissions and 268,000 voters voted in elections.
More than 11,700 ballots have been declared invalid and 24 have been lost.
Last night, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on their votes.
On the lists of the “Single Russia”, six deputies in the Hill are based on Dmitry Swattovski, Dmitria Red, Vasilia Schupranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vyacheslava Rusteryev and Igor of Nagornom.
The only mandate of the LDPR was the leader of the party, Vladimir Girinovski.
The two mandates of the CRC are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and the Secretary-General of Alexander Tarnav.
Three “Just Russia” mandates are available to Alexander Oscumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shaluguin.
These candidates should now decide within five days whether they will serve as deputies in the city ' s mind: if they renounce the mandate, they will move to the next signatory candidate.
The Chairman of the Horizbircom, Alexander Maceev, informed the Commission that he had issued on-site charges for “reporting television programmes of Girinovski and others” in order to waive mandates.
In adopting the electoral report, the representatives of the CRC reported multiple violations.
The Horizbuster member, with the right of deliberate vote from CRC, Leonid Redocutsky proposed not to recognize the outcome of the vote in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, by order of the head of the administration of the Sorma district, the entrance of the administration had been closed, where four district commissions had been located.
There's been no long time in the middle of the Lord's office, neither the candidates, nor the observers, but the resonance scandal with the raid of the door of the radar was displayed on the television.
At the meetings of the District Commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberate vote had the opportunity to attend.
They had ceased access only when the ballot had ended and the stationary commissions had not yet arrived to surrender their ballots.
This has been done to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and the interested persons could be present at all meetings," the member of the mountains, Natal Andruchin, roamed the voter.
Communists objected that in the blocked office over four hours, an illegal deputy of the Zack of the Ludmilu Aristhu District Assembly had been held illegally, for which a statement was made to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also dismayed that, in a number of IICs on the election day, umbrellas began to be sealed at 6 to 7 a.m., with ballot papers for early balloting.
In doing so, no members of the commissions with the right of deliberate vote and observers had not been notified, so they had come to the beginning of the elections at 8 a.m.
Communists are confident that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations, the ballots could be thrown uncontrolled.
However, in a sample of more than 124 complaints on various grounds, according to Alexander Maceiv, no violations have been found with the drop-out of the unaccounted ballots.
The members of the Commission and the proposal by their colleague from “Just Russia” by Maria Popova through the scrutiny of the amendments to regional legislation were not supported in order to establish clearly the time for opening the envelopes with the ballots of the pre-term ballot, which would then be in the urn.
"In order of your own initiative, turn to the CIC," advised Mrs. Pope Alexander Maceev.
At the end of the meeting, a member of CRC, Sergei Samohin, who shouted that the voter ignored dozens of complaints and covered falsifications in the elections, had been attacked.
"You're not here at the meeting, be careful to say it!" the chairman was offended by the voter.
As a result, the protocol was adopted almost unanimously.
Until 27 September, the election must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Lower Novgorod Urban Duma of the sixth convening will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the outcome of the elections, the Urban Electoral Commission denied the political party to the Communists of Russia to register the initiative group for a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were about to issue two questions for the discussion of the suburbs: whether they agreed that the fees for the ceremonies of multi-home houses should be “should be cancelled” and the tariffs for housing and communal services “for freeze until 2020”.
However, the lawyer of Irin Maslova's mind explained that the appeal of Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx is mixed, reduced projections by 2016.
FedEx reported on the unsatisfactory results of the last quarter, and the giant delivery service reduced the annual income projection due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs in its Ground Transport Unit.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx reported that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for holidays.
Its shares were raised by about 2.5 per cent in pre-trade, 45 minutes before the opening of the exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he planned to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends in the next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous projection.
The analysts were projected $10.84 under the FactSet Review.
The projection is reduced despite an average increase of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in ground fees for heavy or sized heavy goods, which begins in November.
The company stated that it continued to plan for increased profits over the past year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and the CEO Fred Smith stated that the company “was stable in view of the weakest, compared to the projection, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The workforce plans for holidays were announced the following day after a competitor ' s statement, UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, approximately as much as they had been employed last year.
FedEx earned 692 million dollars over the quarter ending August 31, 6 per cent more than a year earlier.
The share income was 2.42 dollars, close to an average of $2.44 per share of the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks analysts were estimated at $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been affected in recent years by a downturn in the urgent international transport sector, resulting in a lack of growth in gross income in its express transport unit.
But the online shopping boom has dramatically improved the results in FedEx Ground.
During the last quarter, land-based fees increased by 29 per cent, but the operating income remained generally unchanged due to increased costs of large shipments and self-insurance.
The espress transport unit received higher income due to higher base rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to increased pay costs.
The FedEx shares have fallen by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15 at pre-trade.
They closed Tuesday by 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the 11 June record.
At the most expected meeting over a few years, the heads of the Federal Reserve System will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table from the Honduras red tree, deciding whether the key interest rate should be raised for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of a well-decorated meeting room, two floors above them will hang a wall picture of the United States.
This map is a reminder that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double commission from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and hold stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal System have acknowledged that there is a third unencumbered assignment: financial stability.
And this third assignment may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to escape the unprecedented incentive provided by the almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most data show a positive growth in the economy, recent shocks in the world financial markets can also deter the precautionary leaders of the Federal System from adding volatility by raising the base rate by federal funds, even a quarter of a percentage point.
“It is obvious that the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important subject of consideration,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, the chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for reason not to raise the rates, the increasing uncertainty around the world market would be enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she remarked.
There is no consensus as to what will be done in the Federal Reserve System, which in itself causes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of the economists recently surveyed in Bloomberg projected an increase in interest this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal System to refrain from doing so, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a fall in the equity market if the Federal System raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not mitigate the impact by the promise that the next increase will not be speedy.
On Tuesday, the Doo-Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4 per cent, to 16,599.85.
The raid was prompted by the expectations of the federal system's policy makers leaving the rate this week, said John Lonski, the chief economist of the Moody's capital Markets Research.
"It will be a surprise if the Federal System increases the rates at this point of time," he noticed.
If the management of the Federal Reserve System does so, “they will have to go far into adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they do not panic.”
Other experts objected that an increase in the rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal System seemed to be inclined to raise the rate of 0.25% this month, making the first little step in a slow-intensified financial environment, which could confirm the strength of the United States recovery.
Yellen stated in the spring and early summer that she was awaiting an increase in the rate this year, despite the Liberian complaints that greater economic progress was needed.
Although the emergence of new jobs has slowed in August, the growth of the labour market has been stable this year.
Unemployment had declined to 5.1 per cent last month, which was the lowest in over seven years and almost at the level considered full employment in the Federal System.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continues to be below the annual rate set by the central bank at 2 per cent, the Federal System management stated that the temporary effect of the sharp fall in oil prices was a key cause.
The economy “can handle and require higher rates, taking into account the reduction in the labour market”, observed Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow-Jones share index for industrial companies fell by 16 per cent as high as a record in May because investors feared that the deceleration of the Chinese economy could hinder world growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dow-Jones index is now about 10 per cent lower than the May value.
For the management of the Federal Reserve System, the retaliation of the market further complicates difficult calculations of the rate increase.
“In the absence of information on what had happened in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to twist the gays at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Researcher of UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former member of the Federal Reserve System.
He now predicted that they would wait for at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
“There is a great uncertainty about how the American economy can be affected, and they have almost no reliable data after recent events in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Federal system, and it should not be technically taken into account in these decisions.
But, in fact, the Federal Reserve System has become a global financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
Only a hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could “stop ” its cash display caused shocks to markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it can be expected that the heads of the Federal Reserve System will not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult with representatives of other Headquarters and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “more art than science”, noted Zakari Karabell, leader of Envestnet Inc, a company that deals with global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank, Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “the Federal Reserve System has been the case of overreacting to financial market movements that seem to be unrelated to economic principles in the history of the Federal Reserve System”.
Laker, a member of the influential Federal Committee on the Open Market, who insisted on an increase in the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis has led the Federal System to reduce its baseline rate by 0.75 per cent in three meetings, “notwith the limited identified effects on growth in the United States”, said Laker.
A year later, the heads of the Federal System abolished these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should be the primary concern for stability only in times of major crises, such as market collapse in 2008,” said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The last panic and close to that level, he said.
"You wouldn't, of course, want to be in a situation where you're scared by the growth of the rates because the markets are shocked," said Pozen, President of the Institute of the World Economy of Peterson.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until it changes, I don't think they should be ahead of events.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown.
The market/stage is open in 1997 and belongs to the LAX-C Inc.
The often-called Thai Costco, LAX-C, is an optimal Thai market, which also trades for the public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not in Ty-Town.
Market/call is a shop where everything can be purchased at once, offering a conclusive selection of fresh, frozen and dried products, popular Thai and Asian beverages, kitchens, furniture, religious and holiday ornaments.
There's even a car department if you need to buy oil for the engine.
Magazine is horrible, and it takes more hours to cross all the rows.
If you have a sping, buy food in LAX-C BBQ Express.
The Culinary Division in the shop (good and inexpensive) is near the caste and offers various options for deduction.
Anything you want is Thai?
LAC-C probably has that.
The prices of goods are reasonable, and quite a lot of goods are sold at ease.
Fresh products include delicate Asian and local Thai grass, fruit and many other products.
The meat jar is varied, like the fishermen, and the fishermen will clean and separate the fish, and they will even feed it for you if you want.
A large part of the store is placed under an impressive ice cream department, where you find the frozen leaves of Carrie, the bitter pumpkin and gallagal, the duck, the fish, the beef and the yellow, the pigs, the eggs, the local sausage, the semifabricates, and many other things.
The buyers are the owners and the chefs of the restaurants, as well as the families and individual buyers.
Broadcasts and forklifts are placed in the broad passage.
Discovery: Fresh foolion Montong's next to the exit.
Where it is: Magazine is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, located at the outskirts of the Chinese block and at the business centre of the city, in several quarters from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own site that he shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although there may be a lot of people in the store, parking is usually not difficult to find.
Speaker of the Lord's Descent, Sergei Narichkin, admits that the United States deliberately destabilizes the situation in the Middle East so that the waves of refugees will swell in Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this view to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiral theories, but the question is, Is it Europe's ultimate goal for those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked the question.
"Surely someone had assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these miserable and devastated people who are being saved from death, would go to the well-being countries of the EU," he added.
Narkkin asked, "Did the many European political leaders frankly comment on the causes of this crisis, the wave of refugees, which is now literally engulfing their countries?"
"No, old Europe, except rarely, prefers to be silent," he said.
NATO, in the view of Narichkine, undermines many European values and norms of international law.
“Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially looked and looked at how the NATO military sapog also fads up moral ideals and fundamental principles and norms of international law,” stressed the speaker.

The President of Syria described the cause of the Western resentment to Russia.
The West claims for countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are indeed sovereign States.
This was the opinion expressed by Syrian President Bashar Asad in an interview of RT, First Channel, “Russia 24”, NTW, “Russia today”, TASS, Interfax and “Russian newspaper”.
According to Asada, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another, who would act in the interest of Western countries, not in the interest of his family.
Asaad drew attention to the sharp breakthrough of Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
He said that for them, President Vladimir Putin of Russia “turned from a friend of the West to an enemy, a king, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition that has come to power in a non-democratic way, despite being elected as a result of the democratic elections recognized in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Asaad in the fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the Western Permanent Statements that Asaad himself should leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he departed upon the demand of the people, not by the decision of the United States, the Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
“If people want him to stay, the President remains, and otherwise he should leave immediately,” he stressed.
Asaad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled that cooperation was taking place with them.
Syria also fights terrorism in conjunction with neighbouring Iraq.
Referring to Iran ' s military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in politics, the economy and the military.
He challenged the allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran gives us military equipment.
“Surely there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been done,” he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, if there is a strong desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see it in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-hygiene coalition, known by the United States," said Asad.
The number of deaths exceeded 230,000, and the number of refugees was 11.5 million.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a slander on Stralkov.
Alexander Borodai, former president of the Government of the self-proclaimed People's Republic of Donetsk, refuted the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said that in a telephone interview to Lenta.ru correspondent.
Washington Post's note is beautiful, because it's totally overwhelmed.
The former DNR Minister of Defense, Igor Stralkov, of course, was not bound by anyone and was “out” from the territory of the Republics of Donbas in a very elevated mood, without ropes, with no three quarts of money attributed to him by different characters,” he said.
According to Borodai, it was really about Stralkov in conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper.
"Yes, I said that Stralkova was urgently required to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former Head of Government of the DNR.
Borodai stressed that he was not aware of why the U.S. correspondent decided to write that Stralkov had been taken to Russia by “consolidated”.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it's not provocation, it's incredibly misunderstood words, because I stressed that Stralkov was leaving alone," said Borodai.
"It's a slander for me and for Stralkov," he concluded.
Previously, the Washington Post appeared in an article in which Borodai said that he had taken Stralkova to Russia forcibly.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had been forced to contact his partner.
The Polish authorities began searching for a train with the gold of the Nazis.
The Polish timber began cutting trees above the ground tunnel, where some have been reported to be a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
The work started on Tuesday, September 15, reports Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is essential to verify the reliability of the rumours on the railway composition with treasures.
Arms and valuable minerals may be located inside the trains.
On 31 August, the Governor of the Polish Nijesseilles Voyager, Tomasz Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train was not more convincing than the previous.
However, the authorities had decided to overtake the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Petre Zhukhovski, stated that the local cemeteries, “obviously 99 per cent”, found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich referred to in legends.
Zhukhovski noted that if the assumptions were to be confirmed and the jewelry were to be discovered, they would be the property of the State treasury, and the treasures would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two legal clients contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Walbjah, saying that they had found a train in a drained tunnel at 70 metres deep.
The Principal Drug Law of the RF proposed that the sale of tobacco be prohibited to persons up to 21 years of age.
Russia’s main druglogy proposed that tobacco be banned until the age of 21.
Eugenius Brunn noted that, before that age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - is particularly harmful."
So he said in the direct air of the Radio "Says Moscow", commenting on the information that Speaker Sawfeda Valentine Mattvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
The man's getting negligible.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, and you can be physically ready to do so.
Psychically, he has been ready for a full life in society since the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is only going to last by the age of 21," Brune noted.
Previously, the member of the Public Chamber and the head of the “Treasy Russia” project, Sultan Hamzaev, reported to “Isvestim” that Mattvienko supported the initiative to raise the age price in the sale of alcohol and “had agreed with the General Chamber to re-establish the issue at the top House of Parliament.”
According to activist, the Federation Council will soon establish a working group to draft a bill under the leadership of Mattvienko.
The Bible Asked to Verify the Compatibility of the Children’s Information Protection Act
The resident of Novosibirsk asked the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to verify the Bible ' s compliance with the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information That Harm Their Health and Development, which was made by correspondent in Sib.fm on 16 September.
On 26 August 2015, the author stated that he had acquired a Bible at the Chitai City store in the Red Prospect, published by the Russian Bible Society in 2013.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that in his view violated the FZ on "Protection of Children from Information That Harms Their Health and Development".
On 16 September, a statement was adopted by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Novosibirsk City.
The return of the resident of Novosibirsk will take place within 30 days.
The point is not to forbid the book.
More interesting to show the absurdness of the law itself, the complainant commented to the Shib.fm correspondent.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that will invad society.
But it will begin to read the Bible, which it has never done before.
Brazilian Pediatrics Union Rio Grandi promotes healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric Organization of SPRS has developed a scandal that will convince women of the need for full food during breastfeeding: the method implies a demonstration of breast-feeding images.
Breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and hydrocarbons, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Owing to the high energy needs of pregnant and fertilized women, it is recommended that the daily calories be increased by about 500 calories per day.
A recent study, however, shows that one increase in calorie is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, professor of Beylor Medical College in Texas, found that healthy nutrition for pregnant women actually affects the exposure of genes to children and prevents the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy nutrition on the child's immune system has been identified.
Under Hamburg, the train raided a school bus.
A train hit the school bus near Hamburg, which was stuck on the railroad.

And a minute after that, they had a clash in their eyes.
He was videotaped by one of the schoolchildren.
The accident caused panic among the pupils.
Some children began to cry and run along the sidelines.
The route is still blocked.
According to the police, no one had suffered a miracle except one passenger who had received light wounds.
The accident was estimated at €300,000.
Doctors call for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of a local athlete David Brown Younger.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died of trauma suffered by the Filipino Carlo Magalie.
The fighting for one of the regional titles on the International Bonder Federation (IBF) versions of the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Mahalie at the 12th round.
Brown went to the hospital with a trauma trauma.
His condition was assessed as critical, and he was connected to the lifesaving apparatus.
At the professional ring, Brown won 22 wins, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended in nowhere.
He's got two kids left.
This is the second case of fatalities among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, 23-year-old Braidon Smith died of ring injuries.
AMI now recommends that it be better not to engage in this sport, but rather to ban it from its point of view.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,' said Stephen Pernis, Vice President of the organization.
But in the form that now exists a box, there will always be situations where an athlete gets bloodshed or brain trauma that either leads to death or serious damage.
For that reason, AMI believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narichkin called on OSCE to lift sanctions against RF parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the Home of the RF, Sergei Narichkin, described the impossibility of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said that, speaking at the OSCE OSCE session in Ulan Baatar.
We regard this as unacceptable action as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
“And this should not be repeated, because this manifestation of political shame and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue,” said the politician.
In addition, Narichkin called on OSCE OSCE participants to rebuild Russian and EU partnerships.
Let's bring morality back to politics.
Let us revert to the dialogue and right of international communication.
Let's return the humanistic ideals to the democratic world order.
"The two never ended good," he said.
Speaker from the Parliamentary Assembly called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific tasks in the area of security.
“The first is to resolve the Ukrainian crisis by negotiation and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group,” said Narichkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"It's almost the only common site where we're discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulaanbaatar and will continue until 18 September.
I've been winning for a couple or three days.
The world champion on the light athletics, Sergei Schubenkov.
This season can be described as triumphal for a 24-year-old jetlet from Barnaul Sergei Schubenkova.
He was able to win at his 110-mile crown distance with barriers to the command of Europe, set up a few recordes and, most importantly, become the champion of the world, the first in the history of a domestic barrier sprite.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final phase of the Brillian League, taking a third place in a general score.
"New news" asked Schubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergei, is the season not yet over for you?
Yes, I'm going to play World War Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I'm going to think about recreation.
True, I'll be at home now, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a different state.
It's easier than getting around every week.
You once said that autumn is the favorite time of the year for you.
The end of August, early September, is a great time.
After the main start of the season, the burden of liability was no longer overdue.
You can quarrel in pleasure at a relaxed.
Plus, you know that vacation is soon...
Are you tired?
Still, the season is special, the mass of positive emotion...
The fatigue is always accumulating by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter what's done more, winning or losing.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent flights, movements, all of this does not go unreasonably for the body.
You stay physically and emotionally.
But now I have emotions, of course, at the upstairs.
I'm just happy.
By the time you finish the World Cup in Beijing, you come back often?
There are times.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But at all, I think that the bad athlete who lives with old victorys is spilling his successful runs over and over again.
I had to win a couple or three days, and we have to move on.
The preparations for this wonderful season were very different from the usual season?
I can't tell you there was something so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter contest season.
Trained first at Barnaul's house, then at the gatherings, then back home.
It's as usual.
But with the coach, the task was to try to get to a new level that I haven't been on yet.
Almost all winter time was spent to lay the base.
We ran a bunch of crosses, we did some exercise in general physical training, which included both the pull and the seat, and the back we rolled.
Then they took up barrier training, a lot of technology.
Have you seen how the rivals speak?
I'm always trying to do that, and there's no problem with the internet age.
The winter champion of Europe, and the French took all the pededestal in the barrier sprite!
And I thought there was something to do, I've got to get this company out of here.
With every start in this season, you added and added in the results.
Did it make you sure?
I've got all the last seasons on roughly the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running at 13.20 first, and then I'm 13.50.
I'm always turning my form gradually.
The most important thing I wanted to do was escape from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel that you're ready for a contest, and you're not always willing to show up at the competition.
How was it, for example, in the Olympics in London?
I, honestly, the semi-final run (Shubenkov couldn't get to the final) I tried to forget right away.
I was ready to be very good, I could actually escape from 13 seconds.
Yeah, even if you had repeated your best outcome at that point, you'd have become a bronze gym.
But it's not lucky.
Do you remember your first world championship?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I really wanted to go to the finals, so it was a maximum program.
And he left right off the morning, in the pre-trial runs.
Then I realized that to break and to break my head meant nowhere to escape.
Two years later, the peace championship in Moscow had already reached the end with the best time.
I remember very well my feelings before a decisive run: I really wanted to win the gold at that time!
How does it make it possible to keep your head open while developing a good speed?
And that's the hardest thing to do.
We need to be very careful, focusing on technology to keep the barriers off.
I've noticed that when you're set up, not on the outcome, but on the process, it's much easier.
It's very good when you feel you're running and you're doing it like you're doing it!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the bottom after the first major successes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Have you ever thought that?
Homes are still better.
I don't know where I am without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be good to have better conditions, but I try to be pleased with what I have.
You've been together for a long time?
Since I was 12 years old, since I got into a light athletics.
In fact, first I was trained by his wife, who worked with the children, and then she already handed me over.
I started with a spring, then I jumped in length, three.
The child's bulb was when the ball was melted, they jumped in length from the place...
At 14, I tried running barriers, and I liked it.
From the first run, the second adult level has been met.
That's what I'm doing.
Has there never been any fear of barriers?
Someone got to agree with them right away.
But there's always been a lot of work on technology.
There's a lot of torment over the raid!
But there's nowhere to go from this routine.
The technology must be kept out, so that I could wake up at night, and I would get up and run through barriers.
All who saw your run in Beijing claim that it was a very beautiful run.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
Usually I didn't re-examine my runs, and I couldn't stay here.
But there's no limit on efficiency.
Don't you fear now that the winning year before the Olympic Games is going to be a heavy load on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I'll try to justify my expectations.
If you picked this road, you should go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, no extra cargo should feel.
And I agree with him absolutely.
Satar Kushanasville
Well, I'm not so naive that I'm amazed at the response to the interviews that happened in Ukraine.
People are pissed off, I understand, their bread is not feeding, let's get rid of the enemy.
And although I didn't screw up with the flag, and that's exactly the same thing, a million times said here, and the bastard didn't call anyone directly, I was hurt.
All my pseudo-brothers were able to do it in a second.
The pressing I'm exposed to is so strong that even I've seen kinds of ladies, I think people are white.
It's like he was walking, he was walking, and you were attacked by a crowd, and he was mutating.
But I need to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a gauby, I'm old, guys, scared.
Another thing is no support.
I didn't have any illusions, but now...
The best thing I ever had was self-sufficiency, so you bite.
And giving passports to bastards like Fred Derst or Monson can only be fools.
Better for me, the best journalist, the work is shameless.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the criminal events:
What has been done to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the croucher tried to sign something, never to fit into the general picture of human life.
It's how to come to the neighbor and take him home...
The Kremlin war is out and it's all over there.
I'm almost 100 percent sure, like the summer of 2008, she started with a call from some bastard from the Kremlin Castle.
I have the assumptions who this could be...
Copsone hasn't lived so much.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin' hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, you brought him a monument.
Of course, people remember him as an offenseer of their small homeland.
Reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimir.
Sunrise Seventh leads in the rating despite attempts of Ninth to highlight the failure of leaders in Today's Show
Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's slippery to Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberation of the Leader's Statement was unable to raise the rank of today.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the State after the destruction of Malta by Tony Abbot.
Competent Sunrise, with David Koch and Samanta Armitage, stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture did not seem to have a significant impact on Australian televisioners, with Sunrise audiences of 397,000 in five largest cities compared with today's 339,000 audiences.
Today, there is a slight increase compared with its ranking on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today, the Sunrise gap has been reduced in recent months.
In August Today there were 318,000 in comparison with 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap varied between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 spectators, compared to 314,000 in Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change are more influenced than Parliament this morning, boys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the clarification!
Published TODAY on Monday, 14 September 2015.
The important news for the Seventh was an awesome debut of 800 Words with the ex-star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recent widowed family father, who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with her two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1.219 million spectators.
Critics reasoned whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone without a star Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result last night is a loud answer yes.
The X Factor Seventh remained strong with 1.136 million audiences, easily rounded by The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Chase Australia's luck and failure were mixed for the Seventh evening.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television guided by Andrew O'Kife, 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (from 17:30 to 6:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 audiences - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuyre (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half an hour was over 720,000.
Hot Seat gathered 620,000.
The decline in Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement of the Million Dollar Minute, which couldn't play McGuira's show.

Three finalists agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Will the secret be uncovered?
Lana Jewon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snow Marcoskey may have been given a chance to figure out who would win in the Halloween.
A woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay at Hollyshake is surrounded by a cover of secret.
And the three girls who reached the finishes, of course, keep quiet about who they were who received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snow Marcosca, and Lana Jewons-Fellows on the day before, when two of the three girls would have to stay, they might have given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps quiet until the final to be held on Thursday
All three women are in a lira, telling them why Wood is the ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, desirability, family values, joyfulness as a reason for each of them to be his companion.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who should have the last rose of Wood?" they could say, "Who of them has truly won the heart of the Lord."
Jewons Fellows and Marcoskey have no doubt called McKay the ideal pair for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship since the first day.
"From the moment I became participant, I felt the energy (Sara) and the energy of Sam, and I realized that they were very close to each other, and I didn't have any doubts about it throughout the entire show," said Jewons-Fellos.
"Sara's a very open man with her easy and fun," added Marcosky.
I saw them together, and there's really a burden between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will get a great couple.
McKay herself said that because of her home dating last week, she realized that Wood might have been a man.
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and relatives, I realized that it was definitely not just a game -- I believed him with my whole heart," she says.
To whom Voodoo should be selected, if she wasn't, she answered mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana are worthy of it equally.
Shaw The Bachelor is out on the Wednesdays at 9.30 on Canal Ten.

Jarrid Hayne had a few options for starting a career at NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were keenly interested in them after he moved to the United States -- as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Thomsul and it seems to be a wise decision.
Some coachers would leave Hayne on the spare bench for the whole game for the loss of the ball that the former Australian League league player had allowed on the first re-entry of the pant at the winning game with Minnesso at the count of 20-3.
But Thomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to return the pant, and he used it in the game after the injuries of Reggie Bush.
Thomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the rubble.
Instead of setting up newcomers in the presence of a team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne's press conference after the match.
The Special Rapporteur of Club 49ers Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from Thomas McGoy, coordinator of special teams, who encouraged him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost a ball at the re-entry of the Miss Wykings team during the first quarter.
At the beginning of this debut in NHL Hayne and his numerous Australian worshipers were clearly not expected.
It was seen how Hayne was fighting when he left the field after losing his ball, and later he told the leader of Hamish and Andy at Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a more bad start for the NFL career.
"That happens, you just think about the next game and everything," said Hayne.
Hayne compared his failure to the Origin series of games in 2007, when the drop of the ball in his private area brought an attempt to Queensland.
Eventually, this experience has proved very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and put a picture in Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of gays.
In 2003, Michael Hodorkovski, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of using weapons at the Siberian Airport.
The challenge to President Vladimir Putin was opened, Hodorkovski was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his attempts to develop democracy were suppressed.
Migrants collisions with the police took place at the border of Hungary.
Refugees protested at the border of Serbia near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which had become a clash with law enforcement personnel.
As a result, the Hungarian police used tear gas and reuters.
Migrants cast police stones and try to remove a fence at the border.
Support was directed to the place of clash, and the police were responding to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agnes France-Presse, refugees were able to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Hungarian-Serbian border on buses towards Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports BBC.
The country authorities allowed migrants to arrive in Croatian territory and ensure that they were transported to a needy country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the Army in the protection of the State borders, the criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the expedited procedure for reviewing asylum requests.
The Hungarian Court had already found one migrant guilty of illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serb border, for which he would be deported and could not return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider, as soon as possible, the transfer of border protection functions to the Hungarian Armed Forces.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began building a barbed wire of 175 kilometres on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russian confessed to the largest cyberattack in the history of the United States.
According to Reuters, the Russian Cyberattace, accused of the largest in the history of the United States, Vladimir Drinkman confessed to theft of more than 160 million credit cards numbers.
During the trial before the Federal Court of New Jersey Drinkmann, he admitted to a conspiracy with a view to obtaining unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke of a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
Aggregate damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"Such respondents as Vladimir Drenkman, who have skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drynkmann faces 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a million - dollar fine.
The court will take into account the recognition of the Russian person and may reduce the sentence when the sentence is handed down.
Drynkmann's verdict will be issued on 15 January.
Vladimir Drenkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilean, was detained.
The last one of his guilt in his crimes is denied.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk with the support of the Russian Federation of the Bashar Asad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of the Russian Ministry, Sergei Lavre, Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry warned that the support of Russian President Bashar Asad of Bashar of Bashar intensified the conflict in the country.
“The secretary of Carrie made it clear that Russia's support for President Asad is at risk of exacerbating and expanding the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of combating extremism, unless we focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” says a report published on the U.S. Gazette.
Kerry reaffirmed the United States commitment to combating the grouping of “Islamic State” (which is prohibited in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary-General, Asaad will never be a reliable member of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the Syrian conflict could only be resolved by a political transition from Asada.
In the White House, Russia was threatened with isolation because of the support of Asada regime.
On the eve of the White House, Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation unless he ceases to support Asada.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to accede to the international coalition that was conducting an anti-terrorism operation against the “Islamic State”.
Recently, the media have often reported on the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
To this end, the head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, stated that the Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and had helped Syrians to learn technology to use it against Islamists.
Four people died when the police fired rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police fired rubber bullets in a crowd protesting the proposed new Constitution, as the official stated on Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday night in Rupandea County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the District Police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters gathered at one of the police offices, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police had used tear gas, then fired in the air before rubber bullets were fired.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is unclear why rubber bullets that are known to be killed, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such high mortality.
The clash was the last in a few weeks of violent protests in the southern, plain part of Nepal, where Madezi people claim that the new provinces under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
The protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taru citizens who wanted to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, beginning with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed a country separation agreement in the province, which was a decisive step towards a new constitution, but was a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
The new constitution has been under way since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake, which claimed thousands of lives in April.
Legislators voted in favour of the articles of the draft Constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials stated that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Saiansk is planning to create an enterprise for 900 jobs.
Saiansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 1970s, as a centre of the chemical industry, with an advanced infrastructure requiring systemic support.
A year ago, Saiansk led the new mayor, Oleg Borowski.
On the outcome of the first year of work, on new projects and prospects, he told the Correspondent of the Proprietary.
Oleg Valeriević, why did you start working as a mayor?
I first learned the results of financial and management audits and initiated an independent audit of local budget expenditure.
The audit of municipal property was then conducted.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the documentization to five days.
Earlier papers could go for months.
Income and cost optimization activities have been developed.
Last November, a visiting meeting of the Government took place in Saiansk to address the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project-based documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without that, Saiansk was unable to participate in federal programmes.
We started with the preparation of the POSD on the roads, the kindergarten, the northern sewage collector and the water.
Road operations are now in place in two locations.
How is the decree of the President of the RF on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July this year, 105 children were born in Saianska.
Such a positive population has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of seating in kindergarten is now one of the most relevant.
As of 1 September, the children ' s unit was closed for major repairs of 320 seats.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
The city has not yet received such funds.
Last year, a child ' s garden No. 23 was opened, and 200 children are now visiting.
Refurbishment was made under the conditions of cofinancing from the regional and local budgets, with more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and assistance of the regional government, funds were sought to purchase furniture and equipment, and the National Initiatives programme also helped.
There are plans to start building a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we are planning to eliminate the regularity of children between one and a half and three years of age.
We don't have three- to seven-year-old queues.
Investors show interest in the Territory?
We have a clear understanding that building in the city should be done primarily by the soijan enterprises, and that it is essential for them to work.
In October, a 60-home for orphaned children in Leningradsky was being operated.
With regard to construction, I will add that Saiansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which was included in the housing programme of an economic class.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 blocks will begin shortly.
In total, we announced the construction of 10,000 square metres of housing that wanted to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions is that housing should not be more than 30,000 roubles per square meter, which includes the sub-key unit.
If we deal with the quantities, we will continue to participate in the programme.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At the same time, there was a Saai pig complex, which was sold for invaluable sales in 2004.
We work with the Procurator's Office to challenge the transaction.
The more land under site is in federal property.
Work is proceeding with Moscow and the issue of the transfer of 88 hectares to regional property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest in the reconstruction and launch of a project of 1.5 billion roubles.
With a pig complex, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
In Zayansk, will the Institute for Social Partnerships?
We have some 140 treaties of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Enterprises such as East Central, New-Zimine TEC, Sayan broiler, IDF CPC, are encouraged to respond to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the City of OOO, “Sayan broyler”, a small town was given to the city, East Central repaired a horse palace where professionals were working with children with an ipatherapy, costing more than 1 million roubles.
The sponsorship has made it possible to benefit the urban registry.
Sponsors helped to celebrate the city’s Day in a beautiful way.
As in old good times, a parade was held with the participation of urban groups and organizations.
The book of the Sian poets was released.
The first and the people who have made a significant contribution to the development of Saiansk have been given to the anniversary medals.
The Mecenaries also participate in the city charitable fund.
The first step was the acquisition of tools for young talented musicians.
Over nine months, more than 800,000 roubles have been directed to support talented children to help children in need of expensive treatment to support children from low-income families.
How is the workforce in Sayansk being addressed in the social sphere?
There is a lack of doctors and subject educators in town.
The provision of housing for professionals is of great importance to address the human resources issue.
During the past year, we had five hospitals for doctors, and four teachers received service accommodations.
We have a housing programme to privatize it five years later.
Plans include replanting of the building, which will provide an additional eight houses for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the "Housing for the Russian Family" programme.
In the long run, the construction of a budgeted building.
Most importantly, there's a working team in town with which I can deal with the most difficult questions.
Of all crises, it is important to make the right conclusions, and life will not stop.
Saiansk and our region have great potential.
A social-pence indexing bill has been introduced in the Duma, taking into account the increase in prices.
A bill has been introduced to the Office for the Indication of Social Retirements every year from 1 February, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, a deputy from “Russian Justice”, Alexander Lomakin-Rumians, also proposes an additional indexation of pensions on 1 April if the rate of growth in the subsistence rate exceeds the rate of rising prices for goods and services.
The social-pence indexation is carried out annually from 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth in the residual minimum of the pensioner in the RF over the past year.
The draft law introduced to the lower Chamber provides for the incorporation of social pensions, taking into account the growth in consumer prices.
The first indexation is 1 February and the second is 1 April.
The OSCE head stated that Mogherini was inadmissible to impose sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the European High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federico Mogerini, Speaker OSCE, Ilka Canerva, declared that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly activities were inadmissible.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn OSCE session in Ulan Baatar Nikolai Koval.
According to TACS, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including the representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, were gathered in support of the position of Canerva.
"So much support has been formed," said Kovalev.
He had previously stated that the head of OSCE had intended to gather the signatures of deputies, which indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were inadmissible.
In particular, he noted that Kowalev had promised to raise the problem to the level of the governing structures of the European Union and to “report the petition”.
NHC reports that 60 per cent of the cyclone south of the Green Mies Islands
The broad front of the low pressure area, about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern end of the Green Cape Islands, is likely to be 60 per cent of the tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday to the U.S. National Hurricane Centre.
Another clearly marked area of low pressure between the Green Weath Islands and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports synoptics from Miami.
Google launches a doubling campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced the launch of a doubling campaign for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping European refugees fleeing from war-stricken and depleted countries.
Google used a non-character personal approach to announce the collection campaign in its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masud, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We traveled on doubtful trains and buses, we endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family desperately need assistance.
The donations will be handed over to four non-profit organizations working for refugees and migrants: “Physicians without borders”, International Committee for Rescue, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million donations until the amount on google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe faces the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, which caused more than 4 million people to move this year.
Many have also fled from war-affected Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Small obesity diabetes can help with obesity surgery
The positive effect of surgeon obesity in people with a 2 - type diabetes may be at least five years after surgery, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to claim that diabetics with little obesity live longer after surgery than those who receive non - hyurrourgical treatment.
“The mortality statistics are not immediately shown,” said Dr. Robin Blextoun, an obesity surgeon expert who wrote about a new study in the JAMA Surgery editor column.
Obesity surgeon, or barial surgery, uses various techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the sense of hunger and limit the ability of organizers to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proved its effectiveness in treating diabetes of type 2, but major studies have been carried out among morbid obesity people with a mass index of 35 or more.
IMT, a weight measure relative to growth, is considered normal for 18.5 to 24.9.
The IMT 25 or above indicates that the person is overweight, and people with IMT over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatrial surgery - stunting the stomach and glove gasstrectomy, with diabetes 2 type medical treatment for people with low obesity.
The average value of IMT for surgeons fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, the IMT remains at approximately 29.
Among the survivors of the operation, 36 per cent of the diabetes were fully cured and partly 28 per cent were cured.
For comparison, only 1 per cent of the medical treatment team had a complete cure for diabetes and only about 2 per cent partially.
In addition, the blood pressure, triglycerides and the LPNC cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group” are stated by the authors.
Researchers also monitored levels of hemoglobin A1s in blood, which reflect blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c is better to hold below 7%, writes researchers.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin level A1c fell from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, about 8 per cent.
But the best glycemic controls, reflected at good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce the mortality rate in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Sou and colleagues.
The Study Group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the glove-block group, the stunting group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg) and reduced the IMT (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1s (3.1 per cent to 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full diabetes (46.9 per cent to 16.7 per cent).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method for life after five years, there is evidence from a study of surplus bodies in Sweden that surgical treatment actually increases life expectancy, according to the Blextoun College of Medicine at Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obesity-driven people, the likelihood of dying for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blextoun noted that this encouraged people with IMT below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report here is very important because it states that such surgical intervention is safe in a group with low IMT where there is no higher risk of death or renal disease,” she said.
Blextoun added that people and their doctors should take seriously the weight of the patient as soon as the IMT gets between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to make people take it seriously," she said.
I think it's very difficult to reverse this as soon as they dig out genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies.
In the Mitches, the robbers have been removed from the house of the shuba and 9 million roubles.
In the Mitches, the robbers attacked the residents of the mosquito house and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
That's what Interfax reports with a reference to the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services.
The incident took place on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown people entered a house on the street of Burky, tied the 20-year-old son of the host and, threatening with both knife, kidnapped 9 million roubles and three coats.
Preliminary data indicate that the damages amounted to 9 million 265,000 roubles, and a criminal case under the article “Display”.
European fans are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to host tourists who will come to see the world championship on football in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are not yet quick to obtain a permit.
In the view of the experts, this is a very disturbing sign.
In the run-up to the world, the authorities will have to devise urgently how to settle all the city's guests.
The Rosbalt interlocutors believe that the rental of rented apartments will increase by 10 to 30 per cent because of the tournament, and after the championship, rental housing will have to be repaid.
The world soccer champion made the authorities look at the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law specifically written under the primary title, each Petersburg hotel must be classified and prove that it corresponds to the stated number of stars and level of service.
It is now clear that this will not be done by everyone: hotels are so fearful of checking that they often do not even send documents for requests by the Federal Antimonopoly Service for Petersburg.
According to the head of UFAS Vadim Vladimir, the department has examined 138 hotels and is now planning to bring 34 cases of hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the antimonopoly.
There are indications that the leadership of three dozen companies has deceived citizens by posting a number of stars in advertising, Vladimirs.
The problem is, now in the account literally every number, no one can be lost before 2018.
They suspect that during the soccer championship, the champions will take over all the hotels in Petherburg.
Today, tourists can count on 30,500 tourists in the city.
According to the Smolny, 17 five-star hotels in Petersburg, 51 four-star hotel, 100-two-and-three-star, 550 single-star hotels.
According to the First Vice-Committee for Tourism Development, Nane Guvia has now classified only 23 hotels - so many audits have been conducted by the companies accredited in Petersburg.
There was no idea whether a hotel had ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny, on an amazing basis.
That is, there may be more classifications, but no one knows.
“The last six months of hotels have not been very interested in classifying,” admitted the director of the Russian Union North-West tournament of Katherine Shadska.
This is due to the high season during which hotels earn most of their money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets in which the audit costs have not been budgeted and the hotel may be required, depending on the status of 30 to 100,000 roubles or more.
However, recently the hotel managers intensified and began applying for classification, assured by Shadskaya.
Hotels have to be completed until July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine but will not have the right to work at the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed fee for the hotel for the time of the tournament will be developed.
The costed formulas will be announced next year.
This has been done to prevent the flow of prices by 200 to 300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
We need to have a conscience and not allow a double or three-fold increase, but hotel needs to be paid.
"I think it's up to 50%," explained President of the Russian Hotel Association Hennady Lamshin.
Vadim Vladimir, in turn, is not sure that price fixes are in line with the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how much it goes into the economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better than a long trip," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with popular cheap hostels.
Deputies of the Houses have introduced a bill prohibiting hostages in residential homes.
It is very hopeful that this law will not be passed or dealt with by Petersburg.
“We will defend the view that hostels must be preserved,” Nan Gwachiya believes.
However, she said that mineowners must in any case be prepared to tighten the Housing Code.
If the Master still approves the bill, some 80 per cent of the hostels in Petersburg will be closed and at this time there are 1.5,000 numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restorators and Hotels of North-West Leonid Garbar, there is a lack of two- and three-star hotels in Petersburg, which are just demanded by football chicks, but there is a slash towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation where “75,000 spikes sit in the 80-thousands of stadium”.
You can fix it just with mini hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert considers "idiotism," "I think it's strange that some people can live in apartments, but the visitors can't do something."
If the host is used as a dorm, I agree that it's wrong.
But if a hotel to which guests are coming for a short time, why not?
The mini guests are at risk of losing the world championship on football and because of their unsatisfactory.
Half a hundred small hotels are simply not able to pass the classification, and it is roasted for themselves.
By summer 2016, all the hotels in the city will be ordered.
“Companies that may not do so much, so they will relinquish less paid orders from the mini-detellers, and will choose the travellers,” noted Hennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the tests that have been completed are far above the petherburgs.
The cause of the petherburg delay is linked to the permanent riots of the Government ' s tourist bloc, which does not contribute to harmonized work.
In the view of the experts, if the hotels of Petherburg are not enough, it is likely that the hotels and recreational homes will need to be addressed.
Like the celebration of the 300th anniversary of Petersburg, a river fleet can be mobilized to the city, i.e. the tournament's guests will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many indoors will be trained to attend vans where they can stay.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels to keep them empty," I'm sure Hennady Lumshin.
The rented housing will also be very popular during the soccer top.
Most likely, the city will have a reservoir of rented apartments.
The rental rate will grow 10 to 30 percent.
“On the obvious, the first to go away from the stadium,” noted the Lent Agency for Development and Real Estate Research, Laris Bragin.
The rent price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in bedroom areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport breedings on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg was always a hospitable city where people are not just telling the road but can also conduct a mini excursion.
There are complications.
In the 1970s, my dad met a family from Murmansk, father, mother, and two children.
There was nowhere to sleep with the hotels, it was difficult for them to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," remembered the interviewer.
True, he added that this thing in the city hasn't left to be called home with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failure of the Master's decisions, the errors of the hotel and the government will have to remember the past?
Zyrinov's "sell" in the Amura region.
With admiration, I watched the Jirinovsky clown in the Lord today.
He was doing things like that when our generation was just learning to trade in newspapers, and he's still in fine shape.
The theme of the statement is, for example, “A LDPR protest against the Amurian elections”.
The protocols do not shake - for nothing; there are no other protocols other than those signed by the votes.
Here he raises the second Ivan Abraham and screams, "Here is the winner of the elections!"
Immediately, it is thrown into Rodnin, and then, after the communion with the presiding officer, the faction is removed from the meeting room, crying literally, "You are all with the fronts of your guinea and thieves."
The press, of course, focuses not on Abraham, but on the scandal and demarcation of the faction as a result of that scandal and insult.
Wolfović really made a beautiful and elegant plummeting of the Amur area with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is the next Gyrinovsky ending, in the style of the Pounds, and not the political party's protest against the results of the specific elections.
And the faction was formally scandaled, and the elections, if you believe to the party site and Facebook Ivan Abram, are not recognized, but the leader on the topic is obviously tearing off.
Gives the dead in Amura to themselves to bury their dead, and he himself evangelizes against the “Single Russia” in general and in no way due to Rodney.
It's an elegant decision not to lose a person, nor to be a real one, not a visible scandal.
Another matter is that Abram is now in a strange position.
In addition to the boss he had not waited for anything, there were no alternative protocols on his hands.
He was not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, he was a formal occasion to insult the respected champion, and, moreover, the hammas to ER and ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to think seriously what he's gonna do.
Because from the main electoral beneficiary, region number 2 and candidate number 1 to the only district one, it can become a couple that has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-development for the same SPF and party leadership of a stranger.
Surely he wouldn't have been Girinovsky. He should have been invented and watched respectfully.
The tram is still growing and growing.
The news was that the LDPR would return to the hall at the same prisoner.
I mean, the bang fell out of nothing at all.
One thing, Abraham's subject was underneath.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, stated Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies with the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhist called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama touched on the continuing crisis of refugees in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre of Compassion in Oxford on ethics studies at the beginning of its 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that, in the current circumstances, the interests of humankind should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although it was admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
While Dalai Lama was highly aware of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“The care of thousands of refugees is excellent, but at the same time you must think about durable solutions, how to bring true peace and present development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he stressed.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the number of killings in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush following the terrorist acts of 9/11, stiffly responding to the United States initiating a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution to the problem was possible through non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and this caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increases in the number of children who have suckled hand-to-hand absorption over the past 4 years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported almost 400 per cent increases since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who had swallowed a hand with high alcohol, according to the Georgian Toxicological Centre.
According to Dr. Géylord López, director of the Toxicological Center of Georgia, the number of child swallowing to 12 years of hand disinfection fluids reported to toxicological centres increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children contact these substances more frequently, and unfortunately some percentage of them is sent to the ambulance office,” said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink a disinfecting liquid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue for social networks.
Youtube videos show how adolescents drink dysynthesis liquid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed the disinfecting liquid with the alcohol-containing fluid for the thinning of the mouth to obtain a stronger beverage.
Younger children can attract pleasant smells of disinfecting liquid.
"The baby doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (disinfective hand liquids) are the ones that are aromatic.
There are hand - scented leafs, tubers, grapes, oranges, that are very attractive to children.
The hand-disinfecting fluid contains about 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
Small children, especially a few sprays, can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a high concentration alcohol," said Fox 4 to Kansas City, Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief doctor of the Toxicological Center at Kansas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave a whiskey rubber like that, but people keep in mind these hand-to-hand disinfecting tools, and if the kids get to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six - year - old girl who recently swallowed a hand - in - hand - in - hand drill of about four sprays, was sent to treatment at the ambulance office.
The level of alcohol in her blood was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who is legally regarded as alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchi, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija confused the words and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance office.
The doctors watched her all night in a separate child clinic to keep her from missing any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, told Ritchie.
"It was very scary," told the CNN Oratory Scott, Naigi's mother.
That could have been deadly for my child.
López recommended that parents and teachers use non-spiritual substances or disinfecting salphets, in addition to removing dezinating liquids for the hands of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting liquids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after they swallowed a disinfecting tool containing an undeveloped toxic ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active substance.
In January, three Quartet Classroom pupils in northern New York agreed to poison their “opposing” teacher by “proliferation of antibacterial substances in class”, according to the police report.
The teacher had strong allergies on hand disinfectors, and she forbidden to hold them in her classroom.
The police believe that the unsuccessful plan was “empty conversations” and addresss the subjects of discipline to the school district.
Like the oldest child library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the N.K.K. Kruz childhood library is saddened by the sorcer owl.
Babys who come for books are trying to feed her with confettes.
For several generations, the library has been in the course of 95 years.
The earliest readers in the twentieth century were making loud readings, putting spectacles on the poems of Mayakovsky, conducting literary victorins, and rewriting with Lenin’s wife.
The census lasted four years, and, as reported in 1939, the newspaper The Young Stalin, with every day “the friendship between the Hope of Constantine Krupska and the friends of the child library of Barnaul,” was growing stronger.
Constantine’s hope even sent a child photograph to Barnaul’s distant friends.
And when the Barnaulians asked if the Hope of Constantine had not objected to the library’s name, she wrote that it was not.
The writings have long been dusted in the museum, and the grandchildren and grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose austere profile makes the barrel decorated at the library building.
During adjustment years, various people often called, and they were upset: Why is the child library not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good child writer, without political color!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Cool" is probably the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, like "Linka" in Moscow.
On the floor in a library lobby, a track from a yellow brick.
"The magician of the defy town" is the favorite subject of the artist Oli Moscowka.
She used to be the manager of the legal company, to work at eight, to go to five, and from all the other managers she was only a love of painting.
And then I found an announcement on the Internet, "Illustrator for the book is required."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" -- "My Mum's Cancer."
Olah did an illustration and thought life could end at any time, and no miracles would happen if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates child books from all over the world, and makes tales herself.
It's traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they live more and more in some virtual space...
But the reader's children go to us, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the Russian planet, the director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we have even had such a moment of confidence that a child library is needed, and she'll live, the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the library's lobby, there's a big exhibition with an updated photo-exposition.
Once in a quarter, new pictures of readers go to the library of the entire family — Mom, Dad, and Children.
The library is pleased to see more and more popes coming with their children.
When the child read the whole Chukovsky at two years of age, he needs more difficult books when he is older.
But now there is a law that prohibits eight-year-old vanderkind from publishing books of category 12+.
To get a book like that, a child has to bring his parents -- they come back, then they come back again, and gradually, "The Cruz" becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library -- a pre-revolutionary collection of bennes with eggs and ages, and an annex to the journal "Niva" by "Murzilka" in 1936.
Because we're not just the conceptual space of the book, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, -- explains Tatiana Kushvid.
We can come to see everyone to read, play, paint.
We've made a little kid's play zone, a kid comes to play, and the hand still pulls to the book!
Some of our readers are taken away by their parents, and they are stuck with their legs, and they do not want to leave.
Often moms with wheelchairs come -- and we're glad that they put the library first among all the rest of the places they need to come to with the babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says that today's children like we used to love classic child literature:
“Education is developing, and much attention is being paid to the authors who are the intergenerational linkage.”
And if you're talking about little kids, it's important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes tracts for parents, describing what is happening in modern child literature, what books are worth highlighting, and why.
Booklets are so exciting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden to deliver books beyond the reading room to adults.
This magical privilege only has children.
...in the most distant room of the library, there's a square hatch with an ancient wooden ladder in the basement, in the bookstore.
Students will scratch under your steps, it's a very old time machine.
With your childhood book, you meet like an old comrade: hello, good luck that you and I don't change.
Ellie's still merry walking on the road with a yellow brick, a tol of redsticks steals magical matches, and Malchish-Kibalcis never told the cursed military Тайn burglars, that's what he's saying.
Books like passwords, wherever you know yours.
There's a vault and real book rareness -- for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of benches with eggs and ages.
Or to bring the King in a famous annex to the journal "Niva".
Or the Murzilka shovel in 1936.
It's time, it's old, it's tea-coloured.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, and I'm dreaming of getting out of retirement and taking on rare child books.
But the kids aren't going to do that, and the paints in old books aren't very bright, and the topics... open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Comsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write out this Pioneer Truth?
But it was interesting, says Galina Ilasov's "Russian Planet", who leads the bookstore.
The pages of the Murzilka are darkened from time to time.
The galina of Vasilevna leads the bookstore all his life.
She knows the color of the Buratino collapsing, in which school year Harry Potter became Captain of Gryffindor's cupid championship, in which Karlson uses a slumberer for a motor, and by whom Alisa Selezeva's father works.
The librarian pays little for his work, and all who can live without these books are very quickly finding another profession.
Only the most convinced: educators, educators, ministers of the book.
They can also be learned by smiling, which is considered to be a professional characteristic of a child librarian.
If he smiled at you in the first minute of the conversation, it's a professional.
I like child books at all: how a librarian I like to have them to stand flat and beautifully on the shelves, and I love to read them, says Galina Vasilevna.
I read everything: military, historical, tales, fantastic.
Reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that happened to me at the time.
And since I loved them crazyly, I thought that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be in spite of the rods.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring children, or grandchildren...
A rumor mill: There are no differences in Seltic.
Griffiths refuted discussions about differences in Seltic after Deala's confession that Hups is in a bad position, but he'll fix it.
Harts will protest the Scotland soccer Association claim to Nailson, and Warberton fears the signing of contracts in January that may violate the team's unity.
Dons increased the pre-Seltic to five points.
Adam Runey's toolbars in the first time gave Aberdina a small advantage over the Hamilton in Pittodre, which allowed Dons to move away from Seltic to five points.
Griffiths refuted discussions on differences
This led to rumours of differences in the Seltic, which were suppressed by Griffiths, claiming that he and his team associates are not suffering from any strong criticism in preparing to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we're feeling tension, I think the players are looking for him.
Dutch people are bored because Scotch people don't fight for titles - de Bur.
The former Ringers and former Dutch collector Ronald de Bur stated that Dutch football chicks had lost interest in Seltic because they were not competing for the title of Reingers.
Where Bur, the Aaksa representative is now saying, "The Dutch no longer show the most attractive moments of the games "Seltic," and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
The people here are not just talking about the return of Greengers.
They're talking about an old firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the Star firm games, and not only do people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admitted that Seltic is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
With the defeat of Malmö, and as a result, the exit of the League of Champions was soon followed by a losing of 10 Aberdin footballers, who now, after five points away, takes up the top line of the table.
However, Dale said, "The Settle had bad periods before, and we're going to go out again."
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I understand it's very sad, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
And we, too, but we need to keep going.
And we really really need the support of Seltic, because that's what makes the players much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warberton is awaiting January transfers with distrust.
Despite the views that appeared only a few weeks ago, implying that it had defined some of the objectives of January transfers, Marc Warberton ' s boss of Reingers was distrustful of the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team ' s unity.
The former Brentford attacker said, "The January Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players coming in the summer, you have a period before the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more harm is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Michu, who's interested in Seltic, suggested the end of his career.
Soonci Michu, tied to Seltic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Ledgers was completed.
The 29-year-old player suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
"Harts" is going to resist SFA with Nileson's statements.
The "Harts" took account 2:1 when Patterson was removed and began to play 3:2, but the red card of the defender was later cancelled; this is the third red Collum card, cancelled in eight months.
Nailson does not refuse to say, "I didn't question the ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tinksal.
The stubborn player of the Hibernian team received a speech after acknowledging that he sang a song with indignant words about the former gamer "Harts" Rudy Scakela.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area in Edinburgh prior to the beginning of the Edinburgh derbi in Tyncasl in March 2014.
"It was a derbi, and it was a burner," said the attacker, adding, "I can't be sure to say I wasn't going back to Tinksal if he didn't play for Seltic."
Donnelly: The Tannadys Council is confident of the management of Dandy United.
Simon Donnelly argues that the Dandy United Directors' Board remains confident that the managers' team will change the situation to a better place, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the boys to go out again," said Donnelly.
Macinnes is glad it's "unbeautiful" to win Hamilton.
Derek Mackines acknowledged that his Aberdin team had to grieve desperately against Hamilton Assis in order to achieve the seventh consecutive victory in the League's firstframe, putting them on five points above the Seltic, upstairs tournament table, thanks to Adam Runey's toolbar in the first time.
McInness said, "There's no team here that wins anything, a cup, or championing leagues who didn't win meetings in that way."
Unemployment among Scottishers does not change, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it increases
Scotland remained at 164,000 people during the period from May to July, while the total number of non-workers in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was 5.5 per cent higher for the United Kingdom, as indicated by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 employed at present.
The employment rate for Scotland fell from quarter to 74.0 per cent, which is higher than the average figure of 73.5 per cent in the United Kingdom.
The Minister for Scotland Affairs David Mandell, commenting on the most recent figures, noted: “The Government's long-term plan laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
It has been nearly a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvement in Scotland's labour market in increasing employment and reducing unemployment.
Why am I a witness to the execution in Oklahoma
Today, while I avoid legal interference at a late stage, I will see how people will be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I will sit on the sight gallery of death cells in Oklahoma, when Richard Glossipp is executed with death injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approaches, I became afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since those who often want more than places, the results of a glotery will decide who will be chosen.
In the Oklahoma, the number of press places has decreased from 12 to 5.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it without emotion.
I can't do it.
I'll sit with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we have our own relationship with him after a few months of telephone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk to him.
The prison administration argues that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take a note and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from the Oklahoma accused me in Twitter of acting with my impartiality.
That's a lesson.
Tell me the story of the prisoner the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she could make it better, but still thinks I'm wrong about what I'm doing.
Richard Glossipp didn't agree with something I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't even do it if he said it.
I told him he could turn me out of his witness list any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I'm not going to be here in detail again.
I can't say with confidence that Richard Glossipp is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Trezee make him guilty of an accomplicement.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I'll watch him die.
I can't say I'll be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can ask for it.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch the person I like die without need.
A man persecuted by the police was persuaded to leave the Canning River
A constable from Cunning Weil has been able to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River and to remain dry.
Pert's resident intended to leave the police, but he couldn't get stuck in the dirty water on the shallow water in a few yards away from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to go to the shore."
Kanning-Wayla police were summoned on Tuesday because of illegal entry into foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to leave them, throwing himself into Canning.
But he didn't sail far away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Casldine.
The Laklan Perhavez constable didn't want to urinate the form, so he used a safer reception, "negotiations with a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do weird things to try to escape," says Senior Sergeant Castledyn.
That's what Ben Kazins remembered.
In 2006, Kazins set out in a küvet to avoid meeting a police patrol to test alcohol and tried to cross Swan.
His efforts were futile, but he encouraged local residents to invent a jolly "Byatlon Bena Kazins."
Peter Mudy accuses the stewards of trying to spy and threatens to get out of the horse sports.
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to inject a spy into his studio last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
His target was the stewards and the Racing Victoria Ethics Division, whom he accused of organizing a campaign personally against him, and the removal from the start of Lady Tatai because of the violation of the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Mudi told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to take part in the leap, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive outcome of the Lidary's trial on the cobalt, which he cannot explain.
He's been speaking about suspicion of spying for a year and a half and a year, and he didn't want it to look like green grapes.
"I didn't mean to talk about it, and I've endured for a long time, but sometimes it's so cutting you off that you don't stop," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep fast.
I want to walk with a high-speed head, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think it's not right, then I'll have to stop being a coach.
Then I have to think what to do with my license.
Previously, Mudy sensationally stated during an interview at racing.com that the Ethics Division was trying to spy in his studio.
"Five years ago, Terry Bayley, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat down in a room with a man I call, if they ask, and they asked him to work in my convenience to give him information about what I was doing in the convenience," said Mudy to Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is so, they must all make statements, since they have failed to catch me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Moody, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondrey, the External Executive Director of RVL, knew about this all the time.
Shouldn't that make me think that it's getting personal?
Shouldn't the RVL be courageous and be responsible for what's going on in this business, other people other than coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's the same.
Maybe they should get me a license and push me away, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've reached the point where I don't care, and it's upsetting me.
It makes me really sad.
I will exert pressure on them and will hold them accountable for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The frustration of the coach had only increased during the long investigation of the cobalt and Lidary, and the recent removal of the horse from the startup made him claim that he could “dump his license on the table”.
Mudi, most well known for preparing an invincible championship of Black Kaviar, described the requirements for the use of medicines on the day of competition as “silent” after a compression of clay was imposed on the horse's feet, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on leaping.
“I must bear full responsibility for it,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly compressed her on her leg.
She could get a compression last night.
She could've got it yesterday, like that.
She was with him the day she ran.
Mudi may be disqualified by three months under the medical regulations on the day of competition for the use of a compression, for which the stewards have opened an investigation.
It's anecdote.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," said Mudy.
A driver who carried out a ride and escaped from the Kabram scene was arrested
The police arrested a man who, on weekends, hit a motorcycleist in Cobrama and escaped from the scene.
Motocyclists were taken to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after his car was hit by Murray Valley Haway on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver had left without stopping to help the injured motorcycleman.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalia surrendered to the police in Shepparton.
It is envisaged that it will be charged with leaving the scene of the accident, not providing assistance and violating other traffic regulations.
A motorcycler, a 40-year-old resident of Kabram, remains in a stable state in the hospital.
The Melbourne Storm trainer, Craig Bellamy, matches the charges of rivals in the use of rigid force receptions
The Melbourne Storm trainer, Craig Bellamy, described the criticism of the interception of the ball by his team as the "inheritance of the agenda" on the part of the two favorites of the NRL champion.
Trent Robinson, a trainer in Sydney Rusters, stated that the judges allowed the Storm to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of Storm in the finals of the Sidney qualification game on Friday night.
Brisbine Broncos, Wayne Bennett made a clear hint on "Starm" after his team won the final qualification tournament at "Nozern Queensland Kauboys" on Saturday, when he called this game "typical" for the Reggie League and said that two of Queensland's teams were not very successful in hand-to-hand skirmishing.
Bellamy defended the intercept of the ball by his team and said they were just focused on the "contact" by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident of the criticism of his team by the two leading coaches, since that means that they are concerned about the possible defeat of the St.
"It continues to rise--I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about hard meds when they played us with count 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything for a year in our security systems or techniques, just in the last six weeks, we've given special attention to contacts in the interception of the ball, and it's a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's clearly trained a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, and it's been some shock to him.
It's funny how it's always shown in this time of the year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of a "smart football" by reminding his teacher that St. George-Illawarra Dragonts won Bennett's championship in 2010, showing a "blissful" football.
Wayne's talking about fascinating football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and to see how impressive their game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George criticized a lot by calling him a boring team, and Wayne said he was not concerned.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks as impressive football, especially his young semi-defenses at their speed.
It's a football you'd like to play when you've got these players.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play soccer in his style -- not every team has two semi-defensors like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because they're somewhat worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when they got to big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a competition with a lot of points than the Broncos and Cauboys game.
Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the count? 16-12?
He was 20:18 in our game, there were two more attempts -- and what, is this impressive soccer?
Or do we think of breaks and failures?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm's at the end of this week's weekend, because they won the right to accept Nort Queensland Kaubise or Cronal Sharks on the next Saturday night at the pre-final stage at the AAMI Park, the tickets will be sold the next Tuesday morning.
The Serb in charge of drug storage is bailed at $200,000.
A man who was threatened with life imprisonment for trying to assign 40 kg of cocaine shipped to Queensland was bailed at $200,000.
Marko Maximović, 29 years old, was one of the five people arrested last month after the federal police had discovered 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht walking from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Kumer in August.
During the morning Maximovich and his associates were seen at the harbor, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Although Maximović is in danger of a lifetime for attempting to seize narcotic drugs in quantities sufficient for sale, attorney Maximovich argues that evidence that the latter attempted to obtain the whole party is missing and that the man could be in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court judge Peter Flagangan doubted that Maximovich had to be released on bail.
The latter has links with Serbia.
He travels often to Serbia," he said before the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his location.
The mother and father of Maximovich were invited to pay a joint bail of $200,000 for his release.
“The testimony of both shows that the amount of $200,000 is too much financial burden for them,” observed Judge Flenagan.
But one of these measures was not sufficient to guarantee that it would not disappear, but the judge added.
Maximović was allowed to be released on bail provided that he would pass both his Australian and his Serbian passport, be observed daily in the police and observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Fotis Katzicaris: "Groaning a collection of Greece, which fought until the last seconds."
The Greek Chief Coach Fotis Kacicaris paid due tribute to his team after the 1/4 final of Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said that the fate of the game had made some mistakes.
It was a big game, quotes AFP Kacicaris.
We were preparing for a great Spanish performance game.
They tried to work off the defense, but the defence mistakes determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freilend, "I'll be assigned to Kauna by the CCA."
JOEL Frilland, a new JAS, said he didn't believe in an army curse.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win Eurolyga in the next season.
I talked to Dimitris Itudis a few times this summer and, in itself, after I joined the team, quotes "R-Sport" Frilend.
Yeah, I'll take some time to reorganize the center position, but I've been playing more forwards in the NBA.
Now we're going to have to fight more against the big rival centers, but I've been doing this before, so I think I'll be able to do it now.
The Armenians won Eurolyga for the last time in 2008.
Since then, they have traveled six times to Final Four, but they couldn't show up their best basketball every time.
There's a feeling that the team has got a glimpse.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's hard, I understand all the frustrations of the club and his fans.
But we have a great team right now, and if we show the best we can for, we have a good chance to win Euroliga, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Moscow's already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CCA.
As for the eye, I'm not a superstitious man or I don't believe in any curse.
I believe in hard work and determination if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I have no specific ritual before playing, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the game with the "Rome" will be special."
Luis Enrique, chief coach of Barcelona, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the first tourist group tournament of the League of Champions with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, his current and former team would be far from ranking.
Remember that Luis Enrique trained wolves in the 2011/12 season, but he failed to show himself on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I went back to Rome a few years later, and I've acquired some experience.
I have solely warm memories with Rome.
It'll be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start championships in the League with a victory.
The Augustov meeting on the Cube of Joan Gamper will not affect the action of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the "Romey" game she showed in series A vs. Juventus.
It's a strong team that can press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scripchenko: "The Red Dash" has different options for attacking."
Wadim Skripchenko, Acting Prime League Principal Principal Principal Principal Principal Principal Coach, noted the diversity of the attacking patterns of the rival team.
According to the mentor, "bye" has several models of the attack game in its arsenal.
The team will be held on 21 September and will commence at 16.30 on Moscow Time.
As we play with "The Beautiful," we'll see, and we're going to get the Skripchenko word from the official Urala website.
We have a week of training ahead of us.
This team has various options for attacking, multifaceted attacks, while we are not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In advance of this game, given that the "Crandar" plays a European League match against the Dortmund "Borousy", we'll try to prepare very well to win.
Roher Canyas: "The House of Astana can take the glasses from anyone."
The Astana Advocate Roher Kanyas, after the first tour of the group tournament of the League of Champions with Bentfika (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to Habek, astonishers in their field are able to select points from any rival.
Despite the fact that the match was hard for us, I can say that we played well, and the official WEFA website of the words of Kanyas brings us a little bit of courage in the attack.
Banfika's upstairs, but in the home match, I think we can count on taking the glasses away from them.
It's real.
But first you have to think about Galatasaraa and then about Atletico.
In the home matches, we can take the glasses from anyone.
Rafael Benites: "I'll repeat all the time: Krishtian Roald is the best in the world."
Rafael Benites, chief coach of Real, expressed satisfaction at the major victory in the 1st tour group tournament of the Champion League with Shahter (4:0).
The specialist gave the forward Krishtian Ronaldou, who was the author of three heads.

Stephen Hog used the girl's phone to make paedophiles send photos.
Pedophilus used the 11-year-old phone to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hog took the girl's phone while she was asleep and registered on the Internet communication service, where he received a number of indecent images of the children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the phone missing, and found it in the hand of Hog sleeping.
She checked him and found shocking pictures, after which she immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, followed by a study of computers found at this address and found “conforming” requests in the search system using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then said to the police that he did it because it could "take the paedophiles" and then he would "would pretend he was a policeman to scare them."
Alid Robertson, the Commissioner of the Judiciary, reported to the Sheriff Court in Dundee: “He said that this was an addiction, he had become frightened by people.
He admitted that he had made computer requests, but he said that it was because he wanted to pretend to be policemen to scare paedophiles.
He was interviewed about the conversation with an unknown person who sent him images and asked to send other photographs.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a headache when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, trembled and cried.
She saw indecent pictures on the phone, and there was an eye rate with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used computer and Plaestisn to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23 years of age from Ward Road to Dandi, found himself guilty of the charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, violating the conditions of the mortgage on 25 January of this year and not before the trial on 24 March of this year.
Respondent Gregor Sim filed a request not to bring Hoga to the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it could be argued that the crime did not have a “significant sexual element”.
Sheriff Alister Carmajkle postponed his sentence until October, pending receipt of reports from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but he was detained before hearings in other remaining cases.
It was included in the list of perpetrators of sexual offences before the date of the sentence.
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe reads the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader of the state of Africa, fell from the stairs leading from the podium earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video with the fall stage spread instantly on social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also embarrassed by statements by parliamentary oppositioners that they had received anonymous threats warning them against the surgicalization of Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they enlightened the President when he spoke to the nation in Parliament; that was the talk of Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
The member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change Innocent Goneze stated that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones, warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
“The communication came from a number that was not shown, but it was entitled Death,” he informed journalists at the conclusion of Mugabe's speech.
The members of Parliament had been warned that the inviolability ended in the Parliamentary Building, and as soon as it emerged, parliamentary integrity was not in effect.
A member of Parliament stated that the party headed by Morgan Zwangirai was “protected” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and reducing service delivery costs.
This same year, Hewlett-Packard will be divided into two registered exchange companys, separate computers and printers from more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
The estimated job reduction will result in approximately $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, as stated in Hewlett-Packard.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” stated Mag Witman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more concentrated than Hewlett-Packard is now, and the portfolio of business directions will be wider and deeper that will help the company move to a new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual benefit of over $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable complex technological solutions” to companies, reports the company's statement.
This is the case with a company formed in the 1930s by the graduates of the University of Stanford, Bill Hulett, and Dave Pacard, for the production of electrical equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called “the place of birth of the Cremni Valley”.
Hewlett Packard is in the process of extensive reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This step by HP, the world ' s second computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies in the United States is the latest development in this sector, based on the belief that the narrow-cosspecialized companies are working better.
Captain Arsenal, Mikel Arteta, says that his collars should support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before playing with Dinamo Zagreb.
In his conversation with Wilshire Hunger, he also stressed that it was only September, and that, provided that Wilshire's restoration was planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable event, Wilshire will clearly miss at least four of the next games in England and, given the events, its participation in the European championship remains a question for the next summer.
Most unfortunately, in this recent problem, Wilshire was confident that he had finished the previous season with the only trauma of the ankle and was about to return to the usual aggressive style of the game during pre-session training.
Hunger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not the end of the living bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It's not related to ankles or trauma that he's had before.
These may be medically related things, but, as Hungarian also admitted, there is the associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different injuries that had occurred with him in six years since his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 out of 157 Arsenal in the last five seasons.
If you look at Arsenal's scale wider, you can notice that in six of the eight seasons, starting from 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League Clubs, most of which were lost for days due to injuries.
Hungarian recognizes the likelihood of being stuck in the vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that improvements in the statistics on injuries will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes, when you get back to the line after the injury, you've been vulnerable for a while -- during that time you need to re-establish strength and gain a competitive advantage,” said Hunger.
Jack's young enough and he'll be good.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of it, as well as his career will be the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begins a campaign in the League of Champions on the Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and on the following Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspore, and Hunger intends to rotate the composition.
Ector Belierin and Aaron Ramsi did not come to Croatia, so it is likely that Matié Debueshi and Arteta will be playing a startup.
Hunger may also include Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Gira in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little rest to the players that need it," said Hunger.
Although Arsenal is unconditional in Group F, the Macsemir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most oppressive in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 matches since they had a last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was attacked by an earthquake of 3.2 points on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Hungarian is confident that Arsenal learned the lesson learned in the past season when the team was defeated by the Monaco Champion League and remains unlikely to bring the club to the end of the Champion Cub.
"It's an incredible drift," said Hunger.
Arsenal has never done this before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but, on the other hand, I'm a realist for years.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedian show that taught us important lessons of male friendship
The absence of such stories is being overlooked, especially given the desperate need for men to be frank now more than ever, while the suicide rate among young men is at a maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the sole largest cause of death of men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely than women.
In an attempt to address the problem of Campaign v. An accidental life, 2015 was declared a year for men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression revealed that if a patient has enough friends in a normal mood, the chances of healing are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends doubles the chance of emotional disorders.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all, it needs her to be.
In an age when communication is managed by social networks when the style prefers content, the response rate is often more valued than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, loving, and successful, even if there is a real loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely through internal values, our internal desire for personal growth and friendship, which have a stronger impact on our mental health.
And, as a billionaire recently observed, a video game creator, you can't buy more happiness for money.
Friends' dignity is that they're drawing attention to it.
Each character was determined not through his or her work, but rather through a person who had shown himself in association with friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching soccer on convenient chairs, the Ross' ups on Rachel -- all comes from understanding what men can feel about it, even if they often abstain from a full study of their feelings.
As a member of Samaritans said to me, "my role as a listener for people who are depressed and suicidal, emphasizes how even the smallest association of friends can benefit."
Often the men who approach us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old "living with it" teaching is strong, as is the feeling that frank talk about problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends are one of those shows that come to mind when I'm trying to offer more prolonged mechanisms to overcome.
It highlighted the insignificant moments of male friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a foreign speaker on the phone helps people in times of despair, but long-term support comes from the family and friends of the neighbor.
So if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central on these weekends, where for the holiday, you're completely reinstated the decorations, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or, even better, if you see a single man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Better not to guess the benefits that friendship can bring.
Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all 236 series, on #FriendsFest
De Maria's beating her naked, helping the SPG to break the Malmio.
Angel de Maria is the same as Blaise Matudi and Edinson Kavani celebrating slain balls at the Malmö gate.
Angel de Maria, debating at the Champion League, slammed her head, and allowed Malmö to walk around on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Kavani have done their job when Pari Saint-German started his game in the Champion League with a very convenient victory of 2:0 against Malmö on the Park De Prence Stadium on Tuesday.
D. Maria killed the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champion League as a SPG player was launched to give direction to the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their advantage when Kavani slammed his head for the 61st minute.
Along with the Real Madrid and the Danish Shatter in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in playing against Sweden's champions because they were targeted not on the qualifications of pлей-off, but on the last three seasons of success, where they reached a quarter-final.
They made glasses, but at the same time, it was not the best decision by Laurent Blan to consider Zlatan Ibrahimović to be useless in the attack and later to replace it in the field in the game against a team from his home town and a club in which he began his magnificent career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win houses or guests at the Champion League, so to win with an account of 2:0, to bring the rivals to the problems and play a great part in the protection is a good start, even if there are other points that we will need to finalize during the season," said Blan.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I wish we hadn't killed one or two more balls.
Ibrahimović returned after the injury in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nick, with an account of 2:2 in the first league in the weekend, but he was resigned to the back of D. Maria for four minutes.
The Argentine attacker was noted as a player capable of bringing the SPL to a new level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he escaped Marco Verartie back behind the protection of Malmö, and beautifully finished the attack by sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far corner of the gate.
However, if someone was expecting a light and big victory then, they had to be disappointed.
The Malmö, which won the Seltic in the Plei-Off to reach this stage, with nine world-level players at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two supporters in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of Nikola Jurjich's blow, where the ball flew past the long gate of Kevin Trap for 34 minutes, they attacked a little.
At times, the SWF has failed itself with unsuccessful transfers and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who has not been able to perform at least five attempts only in the first half, and then has not been able to process the ball killed by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
Nevertheless, he proved himself much more skilled in the exact pastures, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovich, which Di Maria had sent with a twisted blow, which passed in front of the trout of Villand's past 52 minutes.
The second naked was finally beaten after an hour of Kavani's mark, and the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimović set up a ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank of Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and only the intercept of Viland's ball from closest distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before Esecjele Lavessi was replaced by the end of the match.
Age Hareida, the Malma trainer later admitted that the PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League was held last December."
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Pari"!
It was a great match with them.

The forthcoming Sochi event and the interim outcome of cooperation are described by the Honourable Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tumeni, Vladimir Schugla, a formal delegation.
Vladimir Fedorović, what are the tasks of the so-solicity forum?
The large Sochi event reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, the important links between the two States.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, and the President of the Republic of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, are expected to attend.
The plenary and sectional meetings will address the experience of the regional and local authorities in the implementation of industrial policies, legal and regulatory policies and programmes of the Federal State.
The Governor of the Tumen Province will address the forum.
I believe that this demonstrates the successful, sustained interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
Representatives of key ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also be present.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be established.
I hope that the Forum will help to enter into new favourable contracts and agreements.
I will add that the first similar meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including 19 Russian regions, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumensk and Minsk Areas has been signed.
The importance of our work is also indicated by the fact that a permanent seminar was held in Tumeni at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus.
In addition, the delegation of APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of Belarus in the training of agricultural personnel, the identification of additional links and the organization of new agro-industry investment projects.
You have recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During a meeting with Governor of the Tumen region, Vladimir Yakshev referred to the region ' s cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in today ' s difficult circumstances.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural equipment and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of cars for the end-user.
Problems were discussed in the work of the Belshin Buying House and the options for the prevention of damages.
Matters are important, as investment projects should work clearly and profit the region.
The further shipments of OAO “MAS” passenger cargo equipment were mentioned, the development of the OAO service centre “MAS”, which was established in Tumeni at the OAO-TAP.
The discussion also addressed the preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus until the end of the year.
Another theme of the discussion was the conclusion of the agreement and the signing of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation in the Tumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamic of relationships promises to come to a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the district centre.
During a meeting with the head of the city of Tumani, Alexander Moor, we talked about the updating of the Tumen bus park.
Approximately 100 buses are already “drinking on the frankincense”, so a new cars from Belarus are required to work on gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tuman elevator plant collaborates with one of the leading elevators of the OAO “Mogyllevliftmash”, receiving the kit.
In my view, this activity could be more active, given the installation of new elevators at the regional centre.
In addition, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region, Alexei Cocorin, within the framework of the enlarged powers of the consul, during which the issue of increasing the trade and supply of modern Belarusian equipment in Zaurala was discussed.
A meeting with the Oms Governor is scheduled to take place at the end of September.
The enlarged consular district is composed of five RF entities, but the Tumen is a district headquarters.
The region is a polygon for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary genconsul.
Generally speaking, such meetings are both meaningful and good in ways that directly and quickly address many of the problems, while releasing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current context, it is essential not to destroy the impact, while continuing to work forward.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people involved in film production
Matt Damon argued with Effy Brown's producer Afro-Americaan, claiming that there is no need to take into account ethnicity.
During the Sunday release of the Project Greenlight show on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black heroin in the project scenario.
"Perfectly, when you're making a tape for the movie itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The scared Brown, in spite of her ears, resentedly shouted "Wow, wow, wow, oh, oh" all the time while an actor from Marsianin was giving comments in a direct air.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown joined the producers of Ben Afflek and the brothers of Farelli.
"I would like the participants, no matter who the director, to think about the interpretations of the Harmoni image they are going to follow," said Brown at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The Dear White People film producer advocated that Leo Angeles and Christen Brancaccio should be the directors of the film; Damon was strongly opposed by saying that "there's not what we want."
After the discussion was broadcast on television, social networks exploded by grudging comments on Damon.
The Twitter user MrPooni was angry about the video: "Explantion of the substance of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black man in LAWE THAT THAT is hurt."
Tweet's got more than 5,000 rhevites and 4,000 "bags".
The comments of Damon appear just when the literal presentation of the racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement became popular throughout the country, calling upon legislators and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the coloured population.
In February, Prince's singer mentioned this movement during the presentation of the applicants at the Grammy Awards Ceremony.
"Alboms still matter," he said.
Like books and lives of black people, albums still matter.
Most recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued a formal statement in response to the Fox News Colleague Elizabeth Hasselbec question of whether the group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," reported the movement leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business, producers and media magnets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
We don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior awards the first champion
A professional sculpture and an assistant to Izek Caldero on Monday night became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show, taking home the prize of $1 million.
On this sports show, whose 7th season just ended, no participant was able to pass all stages of the road with obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants, Caldero and Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task consisted of a rope rise of 75 feet in 30 seconds.
Britten did his job first and put himself in the right time, becoming the first athlete in the history of the American Ninja Warrior, which passed the exhaustive phase 4, but Kaljero had done the task for three seconds faster, making it a winner.
After the victory that came with enormous labor, Caldero, who was shocked that he won a million dollars, gave an interview "E! News."
"I've never earned or lived for more than $10,000 a year, to think about it incredibly," I commented to journalists E! so serious accumulation of my income.
And all of a sudden, this... I've never even imagined how it happens... the future is unknown.
The Executive Producer Kent Wid met the Hollywood Reporter journalists to talk about the finals and why Britten, who first passed the road, would not receive any prize of money.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
"If the Finishers are more than one player, the fastest prize is getting," said Wid.
Although money is a marvelous reward and changes in life, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels hurt about it.
He's happy with what he did.
He got tons of feminine feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff said to me, "if I had someone to lose, I'm glad it's Izek."
And I think that Izek would feel the same if we had changed our roles.
The "America Ninja Warrior" Shaw will come back with the eighth season that will start filming in the spring of 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" is quietly round "Minnesot Twins."
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season wasn't especially fun for Detroit Taigers.
One of the best baseball teams once, the Tigers is now the last place in the American League's central dividend.
Just claiming to be a disturbance, Tigers won the Blaze on Tuesday at Minnesot Twins at 5-4 at the Targitfield.
Twins missed a chance to reduce Houston Astros by half the retreat of Houston and to take the second place in the play-off by the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroitians, even for one night, it was the return of the word to the letter F, which slipped away most of the second half of the season.
"All the winners are fun, no matter how they get," said Brad Osmus, manager.
Pitcher Alfredo Simon made his contribution to support the attacks, resulting in Detroit recruited three points in the first two innings, then added one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a six-three-three-ining pitcher, and he missed three wounds.
It was only his third qualitative start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
Pitchers aren't able to drop in every game, and so I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martínez, assigned to Taigers, was able to beat three strikes and hit two wounds - the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three blows since the four blows in the game against Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He worked a good bit," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in the (batter's quality), noticeably better in the battle work and preserved this quality for the game.
Getting three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
Central host Bayron Bakston opened inning with the field on the left-hand side.
Rytfielder Aaron Hicks took the first base, and the second baseman Bryan Dozier got a strike-out from Simon before his place was taken by Blanne Hardy.
Hardy walked Maera, the only player on the way, before the newly appointed reflector Miguel Sano, who beat two-rane "single" to the left of the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
In the early vapour pair, the wound comparing at the second base of VerHagen has succeeded in bringing Trevor Pluff's third base to the dumble.
It was the 27th time for the lead player of the top league in this season, when Pluff beat his ball on the dable.
After Detroit added insured wounds in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned RBI as a “duble” to the space between the autfielders against the Tigers Covered Peater Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the law - affair player beat Sano out after three strikes and received his fifth site.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, a non-practice at the beginning of the game.
Tigers made three wounds in the first two innings against a well-deserved pitcher who was on the list of traumatized before the game itself, lacking more than a month in connection with the inflammation of the leaflet.
"Surely not the start I'd like," said Hughes, "but as the game develops, I feel more comfortable, so I was able to do some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first better got to the first base, Hughes threw the second baseman, Ian Kinsler.
Wook at two raithfielder out, J. D. Martínez, got Victor Martinez, who made a synthesis in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Viktor Martinez finished his series of "0 for 21" with the early men in an effective position.

The Tigers increased the account in the second inninge by receiving one-auto-dubble from James McCann's catcher and a two-a-wound "single" of the central reflecting Anthony Goose, and it was 3-0.
"It was a powerful hatch," said Paul Moletor's manager.
He wasn't particularly good, but he got right at the right point.
Hughes, whose ankles were believed to be thrown in a third inning, was then replaced by the provincial Reliver, A. J. Ahter.
Hughes had three wounds on six hits and a cup of four automy strikes.
NOTE: Pitcher-Righter "Tigers" Anibal Sanches departed from the players in connection with the stretching of the right shoulder.
He's going to be examined by Dr. James Andrews who's done Sanches' operation on his shoulder in 2007.
Sánchez, on the list of traumatized since mid-August, is scheduled to leave the start on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanches, Pitcher-Lesch Daniel Norris will leave a list of traumatized people and go out against Twins.
Norris, who left the Tigers at four starts since he was purchased in exchange for David Price's pitcher on 30 July, has one victory and one defeat.

The original of the complaint of Cadyrov, according to the book Moloba to God, went to the South Sahelian Court.
The City Court of South Sahaline received an original appeal from the representative of President Chechny Ramsan Kadirov on the decision to recognize the “extremist material” of the book Moleba to God: Its significance and Place in Islam, reports Interfax with reference to the chairman of the Hill of Alexander Chuhray.
The Court is awaiting possible objections from the parties to the process.
Chuhrray refused to comment on the statements made by some members of the State of the State of the United Nations Office on Human Rights on the need to verify the harbours for possible cooperation with foreign special services and IGIL.
"Say it yourself to comment on such foolishness," he said.
On 11 September, the City Prosecutor ' s Office of South Sahaline filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natali Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
The South Sahelinsk Public Prosecutor's Office appealed on Friday night.
There are nuances: in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, they believe that they have asked the court to accept extremist only the opinion of the author of the book, not the Ayahs of the Koran.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the judge has made an incorrect decision," said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was adopted on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the quotations of the Qur'an were called "We worship you and pray to You for help" and "Do not call upon anyone besides Allah."
Cadirov called the decision-makers on the book "schitans and provocators."
The Deputies of the State party had called for a legislative prohibition of judicial decisions concerning the texts of sacred writings.
“I am firmly convinced that the Lord must adopt a law prohibiting judicial action concerning the texts of the Koran and other divine writings,” said Cadirov in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Faisbuk staff intend to remove posts and comments that give negative assessments to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that gather user complaints of wrongful content.
To combat xenophobia and racism on the network, the Facebook leadership intends to work with the German Ministry of Justice.
For example, the head of the Haiko Maas department earlier stated that the ministry, together with social network specialists, is currently working on the establishment of a special group of engineers.
Its participants are required to track and remove non-correct comments against migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, the authors of non-tolerant posts are expected to receive notifications indicating the reason for their deletion.
The operational blocking of the wrongful content should also be facilitated by organizations whose professionals are engaged in collecting complaints against offenders from users.
The Facebook leadership intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments on migrants and refugees, the leadership of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after the German Feisbuka segment had experienced a dramatic increase in xenophobic sentiments.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which covered the European Union some time ago.
Thus, Germany has already overcrowded all locations for refugees.
The country ' s predecessors had decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced displaced persons from the countries of the Middle East and Africa are placed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
The Moscow cemeteries will have releasing zones.
Shortly thereafter, several capital cemeteries are equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological recreation.
The first will be the Bhutovsky, Domodedovsky and Jerbine cemetery.
The first area for psychological recreation has already emerged in the Troecurov cemetery in Moscow.
Such sites will continue to emerge in other parts of the city.
This portal m24.ru was described by Artem Akimov, head of State Budget Institute Ritual.
Relaxation zones will be made up of small green areas resembling parks.
In the opinion of experts, visitors to the cemeteries will be able to rest, stay alone and rehabilitate psychological forces.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovsky, Bhutov and Jerbin cemeteries and then in other parts of the capital.
According to the chapter of the HBS, Ritual, if there is a need to expand the cemetery, the builders will try to maintain the existing forests to the maximum extent possible.
Green plants will serve as a live fence, which will separate recreational zones and areas directly under burial sites.
The HBS “Rithual” experts also expressed their intention to propose abolition of burial fences.
New cemeteries can really become barberless.
In addition, Ritual reported on the readiness of installing electronic terminals that would enable cemeteries visitors to identify GPS coordinates and safety plates.
In June this year, Ritual also proposed that the cost of burial services be adjusted according to the time of the year.
So the digging of the grave in summertime would cost a thousand rubles cheaper, a week of winter when the earth was frozen.
In the past year, the cost of all ritual services traveled an average of 10 per cent.
Five days later, a mushroom was found in the elynine forest.
The elderly man was alive, although he had spent more than a hundred hours in the forests without promising.
Rescue and volunteer efforts have led to the discovery of a mountain scourge.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent, "Five days a 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov district spent in the forest."
No food and water.
His relatives, rescuers, volunteers were looking for him.
There were even movies with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after the helicopter was connected to the search.
On that day, Vitaly Alexandrović, as usual, went to the forest with ostrich and breeders, but did not return by evening.
The family immediately sought help, and the next day, rescuers and uneven residents from a neighboring village were raised to search for a fungus.
They were joined by a fire and rescue helicopter for five days.
Andrey Seletkov, chief of the search and rescue team of the Smolen Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said, "The Vertolet was attracted, the man was discovered."
He's gone very far, completely differently.
It was about 12 kilometres from the search site.
He's gone a long distance at his age.
The miracle is alive.
The mushroom was taken to the Ellen Central District Hospital without consciousness, in extremely difficult condition.
Medicines diagnosed pneumonia and severe dehydration and refrigeration of the body.
As an elderly man was able to survive five days in the woods, doctors do not know at all.
Valentine Nepsha, head of the Eldinian CRB's therapeutic office: "Peter's examination, treatment.
Infusion therapy, anti-bacterial.
Considering all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition has improved in the morning, remains difficult, but with a positive momentum.
Vitaly Alexandrović pensioner travels to Smolencin every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather was still walking to collect mushrooms, but he never went far into the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found mushroom, said, "Les not far from the road, it's not in principle local."
For a few years, I was visiting my family for a few years.
Well, I went after the mushrooms.
I guess I'm going a long way and I'm lost.
At the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all parts of the Smolen region.
In just the last few days, five similar cases.
Rescueers remind you of the need to walk into the woods in bright clothing, with little food, matches, and compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave tracks behind so that you can return.
Analyst Ang-2 sat on a crossing in a brother's taiga.
Right on the crossroads in Siberia, emergency An-2.
An emergency landing aircraft by the Red Air Force, Enisey, took 68 kilometres from Bratsk.
There are no dead and victims, but the aircraft itself received significant damage when landing.
An-2 was on a service flight.
On board, there were three crew members, a commander, a second pilot and aboard mechanics, reports Interfax.
An accident aircraft flyed through the Railport-Ilymski-Acinsk route, where the airline is based.
The aircraft's crew is already shipped to Brothersk.
The Brother Transport Prosecutor ' s Office, following the emergency landing of An-2, began to verify compliance with the law on flight safety.
The East Siberian Transport Procurator ' s Investigative Unit has left the scene.
In September 2010, the Tou-154 crew planted an aircraft with passengers because of technical failures on the abandoned clandestine airport in Coma.
Engines and on-board electronics were denied on the liner, but the crew did not.
Ten crew members and 72 passengers were on board.
No one was injured during the emergency landing.
Story of the Economics: Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes had to contribute to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, and the difference in income in developing economies is increasing.
Eric Maskin.
To that end, it is necessary to improve the education of low-skilled workers, the Chief Research Officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Building of NIAE, the Nobel Prize Laureate for the Eric Maskin Economics, 2007.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced the unprecedented growth of global markets.
Trade boundaries between countries were becoming increasingly open.
Globalization advocates foreseeed great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have come true in many ways," emphasizes Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a significant per capita GDP growth.
But not all are so cheerful.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between “poor” and “inexpenditure” in poor countries, which was manifested in a large income inequality and, more precisely, wages.
But this inequality has in fact only increased, notes Erik Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Have Not Decreased Inequalities in Developing Economies”, published in the World Bank Economic Review, which has been translated and quoted by NIEW.
Together with an economist, Professor Michael Cremer of Harvard University, Eric Maskin, developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income difference in poor countries is increasing as globalization grows, resembles NIEW.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin has four qualifications for the wealthy, C and D for the poor.
After globalization, experts from poor countries D lacked the skills to cooperate with experts A and B from rich countries.
And if employees at the C level have increased their wages by cooperating with staff members of the rich, the growth of D does not feel or falls their wages at all.
The outcome was that the internationalization of production would contribute to the increase in the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and the rise in inequality, respectively.
The Cremer and E. Masskin are offered an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Rikardian Comparative Best Theory.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alexkerov, a professor of the International Analytical and Decision-Based Laboratory, head of the Department of Mathematics of NIA WSHE.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it'll lead to empirical work in this area.
The solution to the problem, according to Erik Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, according to the scholar, do not have the means to do so, and companies do not benefit from their education.
In such a situation, Governments, international agencies, NCBs and private funds can play a significant role, as Maskin believes.
Scientist notes that the theory in no way calls for a halt to the process of globalization, which has produced and produces its fruits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: live communication in time.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities of Russia, observes its 2000th anniversary in September.
In the celebration programme, a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the way of past times, exhibition of derbent carpets and Day of Open Temples, a two-hour historical and musical show and tours at the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Average rocks of the Narin-Kala fortress, old Arab inscriptions on walls, narrow streets and palace gardens, all kind of falling off the pages of the Thousand and One Night.
Derbent is the only city of Russia that has remained in its place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Vizantia, the Hazar Kaganat, and the Golden Ord.
The age of East Plain, which grows in the derbent Juma Mechetti courtyard, is several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian Days - Monuments of Nature.
The shadow of scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during summer heat.
The mosque visitor will have a fragrance of tea, and will be feasted with Daghestan figs, hurmes, musmula, pestilences, Iran and sweetness.
In Derbente’s erasic spocks are used by large self - cooks to drink tea of many guests at one time.
A sign above the entrance to Juma-mechet says the building was built in the year 115 Hijra.
I mean, in the year 733 on the Grigorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is amazed by the extent and solemnity of the swimming arcades of the domes and convoys based on the square convoys and covered by the sun's beams of the small windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is the traditional attraction of the residents of Derbent.
Domestic bird owners put pigeons in the courtyards, under the trees, on the hills.
A fascinating sight is a glitter of white pigeons like the outbreaks of a firework.
For defence purposes, the ancient Persians overtook the Caspian gates with a double stone wall.
It's a 500-foot-dollar building that shut down the Derbent harbor.
In 2003 the Derbent walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the most preserved monument of the ancient Persian fortification.
The carpets in Derbent were still in the fifth century, and until today, the technology of this unique craft has remained virtually unchanged.
In one of the streets adjacent to the urban market, carpets are sold to any taste - palas of wool, cotton, or foam of all colors and colors, wats and no other, with complex ornaments and fascinating potassiums.
The construction of the city began with a block of one - story stone building.
Over the years, the Mohamas have almost changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on walls, and street lights remind you that you are not in a medieval city but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city, the parts of the water supply built by the Persians were preserved some thousand years ago.
To this day, there are ancient sources where locals still collect water.
Many derbentists prefer conventional water from crowns from tested historical fountains.
In Derbent, there was one of the potter’s crafts centers.
Polish and chartered vases, dishes, jars, cups and cups were valued for all the Caucasus.
The hand of the potters is still making remarkable ceramic works, both practical and souvenir-purpose.
During the holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators are gathered under the tightened rope, at which the students of the Republican Circus School are present.
The history of amazing and risky skills has been a number of centuries.
The new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among the canaanists.
The former Virgin's Banny's premises are now in the Cultury and Home of the Ancient Derbent Museum.
In the past, unmarried girls and fiancées were washed here with their girlfriends, and now anyone who would like to see a packed hall, hot and cold basins that went into past bathing supplies.
Most of the Derbent houses have hot water, but the banni and the lads are popular today as they were in the past.
The benefits of steam heating are written in ancient books.
After the bathing, the muscles grow tired, the body becomes flexible and easy.
The “Community” festival, which takes place in the Naryn Kala фортier, is attended by ethno-fields in many areas of Daghestan.
Participants in national suits dance, play popular tunes, perform songs of the Caucasus peoples, and feed visitors with good home cheese.
Cyrchlar is the place of burial for forty martyrs who have headed for Islam.
This is one of the most honored complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagies have been cut out of whole stone blocks and, as Arabs say, are in the west-east axis.
Gavriel and Albert Yakubov are strangling and burying customers in a small cabin near the Upper Market.
The parrotmakers are in this place for many years.
Cyrillic trade is transferred from generation to generation.
At the same time, Yakubov’s brothers can do not only the traditional but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, the Caucasus writer-decabrist, Alexander Bestujev-Marlinski, lived a house.
After studying the Turkic language and compiling ethnographic material, he described Derbent’s first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, lives, and households.
Chaihan is a traditional East Club, where only tea and homemade are served.
Men come here to satisfy their thirst, to communicate with their friends, and to solve some working problems.
As in past times, women are not recommended to cross the tea-stage threshold.
The Derbent dance ensemble “Capee” was established three years ago, but has already taken part in the activities of the Republican and Russian levels.
The bansamba are rehearsed every day, exposing, in perfection, the people’s abstract, Darginal, Tatian, Armenian dancing.
As the evening comes, when noise is quiet and street lights ignite, local residents sit on benches near houses with terraces.
Typically, derbents are discussing household issues.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they are increasingly reminded of the unique history of their town, which has affected the destiny of the entire Blackmoorsco-Kaspian region.
A business game at the airport was held in Domodedov.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students tried to serve as airport staff.
To that end, the three airplane models were built in Domodedov.
Young people not only watched and recorded passengers but also maintained aircraft.
It's all in the form of a business game, but it's hardly a reality.
The residual flights, two passengers with breaks on board, were lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For the present airport, hell.
To be settled in Domodedov's encampment, a standard set of tasks to be resolved by newcomers.
Three large airports from around the world were placed at the same time in one of the hangars.
There are now four hundred students from capital colleges and colleges.
It's an unprecedented chance to know everything about the inner world of air gambling.
Registration of passengers, maintenance of aircraft, traffic in luggage - even buses on the flight field, staircases and passenger inspections.
And passengers are really troubled.
One had a bad deal with the documents, another was late on the flight, and the third was filling the bag with suspicious items.
And we need to figure this out, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, it has a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline had paid the corresponding amounts for the maintenance of the flight.
"For their failure to perform their tasks, a fine is imposed," explains the Best-Mosqua financial analyst Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this examination is an attempt to test a new form of education.
She has already found a place in secondary vocational education.
“There will be six interregional competencies that will, in fact, become new models for modern colleges with a modern management system, with high-skilled personnel, with modern equipment”, reports the Director of the Department of Public Policy in the areas of training of workers and additional vocational education of the Ministry of the Russian Federation, Natal Goldareva.
But students aren't in the way of global plans.
After three days of training, they might need a weekend.
However, the evaluation for the examination had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding in a timely manner to our Instagram airport claim," is pleased with the player of the game, Sergei Schiovov's "Aeroport Frankfurt".
The best judges, called, were taken to the pencil to invite them to work at the time of the completion of the study.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Centre in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature of the American Centre in the Library.
The Centre worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Embassy Centre at the M.I.Rudomino Global Public Library in Moscow.
“Unilateral steps taken by the RF recently challenge the Russian Government's commitment to the Russian-American peoples that have not been interrupted even during the cold war and other difficult moments of the long history of our countries' relations,” says the U.S. Ambassador John Tefft, who entered Interfax.
The American Centre has established deep and lasting links between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital and served as a place for meetings with many American eminent figures, including astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Only last year, the American Centre conducted more than 400 cultural and educational activities and hosted over 50,000 Russian visitors,” stressed the diplomat.
Tifft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project, the FLEX Educational Exchange Programme (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was expeditiously executed.
Typical situation: Four officials are facing the table of Judge Swatanter Kumar, hearing his claims for the work done.
The Court is totally dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order that you may be sore, says Kumar.
If one more brick is put on, we'll have to cut down all the buildings.
The Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NLB), a judicial authority established in 2010 to halt the rapid pollution of the environment, accompanied by the turbulent economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal had before it more than 10,000 cases of air pollution, debris collection, geological development, toxic waste and dump construction.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
The rates are incredibly high: over the mid-60 years since the declaration of independence of enhanced industrial development, India has become a country of virgin jungle to one of the most populated and contaminated countries in the world.
Particularly difficult is the major megapolis where infrastructure development is not fast for urbanization: cities are covered with dense power, rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes of enterprises and households, and few of the remaining residential areas are cut out under construction by new housing blocks.
Despite the State ' s formal support for the green movement, the NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendra Modi, as it is often the main reason for the lifting of major investment projects.
In May this year, the Minister of the Environment called the decisions of the court “extreme” and “unimplementable”.
Sometimes the court ' s decisions could not be enforced within the court ' s deadline, confirming the defence counsel in the environmental cases of Raj Panjwani.
However, unfulfilled delineations also have a positive side: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"He's the main goal of breaking the system," adds counsel.
The Green Tribunal has cancelled large buildings on several occasions, with the closure of airport, power plants and hundreds of smaller installations.
In doing so, they also try to keep in mind: For example, during discussions on the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which contaminated the local river flutoride.
We can close your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People lose their jobs," commented Kumar's decision.
Such explanations, however, are not always understood by ordinary people whose lives can change because of the dissolution of the judiciary.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, rather than to resent the general public.
Despite the dramatic decline in popularity and criticism, Swatter Kumar refused to repeal this decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of Delhi statistics on incoming and exiting vehicles, and offered to purchase 10,000 additional buses, prior to learning in factories whether they were able to perform such orders.
As the courts began to receive pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality and even road incidents, people's anger began to slow down.
But the most sick subject of the Principal Judge was the Ganges Cleaning Programme, with the Pope announced by Prime Minister Narendrah Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often ceases to control his emotions and goes into screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water out of Ganges into God's statue, and there were feces in it, and the judge was hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think Ganges is Ganges, he'll take all our sins.
It's the river we worship, and look what you're doing to her every day.
The cleanup of Ganga is the most ambitious and costly environmental project that the new Government has announced.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times higher.
Every year 1.5 million to 3 of the 700 million industries in it die of infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Ganges Rescue Fund for the sale of his suit, where he met Barak Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the premiere of populism: the costume was purchased for $700,000, while the river was cleaned up to at least eight billion.
The Green Tribunal concurred that India had a long way to go before it could claim to be a developed country, but did not consider that the value of progress should be ecology.
“In a developing country, environmental conversations are often perceived as inconsistent luxuries,” says Malika Bhanot, activist of Ganga.
And the court is trying to find a golden middle between ecology and development."
The man blew a couple of Daly paintings at the Riga exhibition.

Si Jinpine calls for the economy to be more open to peace
The economy must become more open to the world in order to stifle its growth, as President C. Jinpin said on Tuesday in addressing the group that is facing the task of steering reforms.
“China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open policy,” he said, referring to the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Lead Group on Comprehensive Reform.
He said that the expansion of openness and deepening of reforms would give the economy a new impetus and life force and would provide a new space for economic development.
The Lead Group adopted a number of directives, including the regulation of investor access to the market, the amendment of border control rules, the promotion of public enterprises (SOE) that attract private capital and the revision of the resident registration system.
It is said that a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually adjusted through test programmes.
This is an important step, since it will give the market a more significant role in the allocation of resources, the rule of law in the business sector and the promotion of openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken its control over the power of companies, thus guaranteeing that companies themselves will run their own business.
The statement also stated that China would allow the border regions to explore new models for transboundary economic cooperation and new mechanisms for enhancing local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of the sub-government sectors of the economy.
“The Government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financing companies and provide them with better conditions,” said the statement.
Additionally, the application for a permanent residence permit will be facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the process of filing.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, Prime Minister Lee Ketzan and Ministers Liu Yungshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended.
