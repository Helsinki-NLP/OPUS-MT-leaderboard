In Herson, people went back to the rally, the Russians didn't have time to disperse.
As the western agency reported, the Kersonmen were able to hold a rally before military rifles and technology arrived.
“We've been able to make a rf technician, ” said one of the West participants.
Previously, the townsmen were traditionally gathering to protests in the Freedom Square -- near the building of ADA and the lodgings.
This area is now, like the building, controlled by the armed Russian forces, who use weapons against the members of the rally and steal people.
On April 3, the armed Russian occupants reportedly used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Cahovka.
According to Ukrinform, people in Donecchia regularly carry out peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
Russian military forces use force and weapons against people, wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap the inhabitants of the area.

If Nazar works at 5:30, he can use any train:
Green: Marioupol's heart of war, stop fighting, we'll have weak positions.
President Vladimir Greensky believes that fighting eastern Ukraine and, in particular, for Maríopol, will determine the course of war – and if the CSO is defeated there, the Russians can abandon negotiations and reoccupy deoccupied territories.
"Mariul is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights, we fight, we're strong.
If it stops fighting, we'll have weaker positions.
They are the people who have dragged a large number of enemies upon themselves.
The stronger our position in Mariopolis, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the OIA region, and if they are stronger, the table of victory will be more close to us and we will have the advantages in a dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all of these directions, we may not wait for a meeting.
Because then Russia will take all of these steps that can lead to return even to the cities that we've now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation will be weaker and perhaps not even interesting to the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our outcome, in our victory...."
Parts: Green also said it's difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we must not lose our ability to do diplomatic decisions if we have them."
And the direct language is, "People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
Under our conditions, the conditions of Ukraine's independence, but... every family has lost something -- and I don't think they'll be satisfied with any peace under any conditions.
But if we're not talking emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it's going to end with millions of victims.
And even where there is a million victims, everything comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight - but for life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, no people."

The dining room requires code
The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense Prosecution Directorate has published a list of Russian military personnel involved in war crimes in Bucha of the Kiev region.
According to Ukrinform, this is the Chief Intelligence Authority of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine reports in Facebook.
“ Every Ukrainian must know their names!
Ukrainian military personnel have obtained a list of 64 separate motor shooting brigades directly involved in war crimes against the Ukrainian people at Bucha,” the report states.
HUR MOW notes that crimes against the peaceful population of Ukraine will be brought to justice by all war criminals and will be brought to justice.
You can view the list with references.
According to Ukrinform, Irving, Bocha, Gostomel, and all the Kiev region were released from Russian invaders.
In the freed cities and villages, massacres by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the city head of Buchie Anatolia Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
On April 3, the Attorney - General of Irina Venictov declared that 410 bodies of civilians killed by peaceful people had been removed from the Russian invaders of the area of Kiev.
On February 24, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, announced the beginning of a full - scale invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian invaders are fired and destroyed by key infrastructures, mass attacks on Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, gallery fire systems, ballistic missiles, aircraft.
Good afternoon, I'm sorry, but I can't work you because I'm going to go to Canada in the near future.

Professions that offer, possible without learning a language?
It's important if there's such a tradition, I need to know if I'm ready.
I thought in a week, but we've got a bad situation.
Tomorrow, maybe there'll be a bad connection on the road.
I thank everyone for the experience, even if he is painful.
I think I've learned from every situation so I don't want to repeat the mistakes.
Directives are made in the form of numbered written supplements that are part of this Rules.

At the beginning, you can try it free.
Maybe you'll write us an algorithm, we'll pay for it.

location, day and time will be clarified according to interests and opportunities
We promised you, when you go to school, we'll surprise you.
It was great, I have two months of rent, the area in Olomouk doesn't matter, I'll be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of brutal violence against civilians north of Kiev.
The photographs of the slaughtered and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?
I'm not surprised at anything, and it's exactly what I've been upset and waiting for...
I brought my children and older parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls were colleagues with the children, and only then came back to work in the capital.
Since 2014, I have consistently assisted the MSC and never doubted for a moment that in the case of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I've been and remain absolutely confident that the rotten Communist regime has remained unchangeable since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist; it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my grandfathers was shot in Zitomir prison.
A few years ago, the Gitomiri U.S.A. had a copy of the oppressive case of the grandfather: the whole case is over a hundred pages, and the sentence of execution is very simple and even more fearful.
The accused was illiterate, he denied his fault.
The Ethnic Pollah, a Catholic, had five children, was out of free people, a poor "one court" path, never walked in the fortresses.
The fact that there were several cows and hammers was sufficient to denounce the pahar and the feeder of young children to the execution.
The family did not even know the place of burial.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken out of the village and killed all except two who agreed to give false testimony.
There's a penal case called Shariy's knocker.
Our former Speaker of the Supreme Council comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics, and I am not surprised if his relative was a KGB.
The apple from the apple is near, as we know, falling...
The disappointing three of the peasants were the ethnic Russians.
In analyzing the case of the grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are beautiful (without sarcasm) information resources like the Besmothic Barak in Russia, which is a good reminder of the events of those years.
So in modern Russia, descendants of NCWDs have found ways to punish and kill almost all who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70 or 80 years ago.
People who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repression and who publicly wrote the names of murderers — the system initially discredited and then destroyed.
It's like they found files with child pornography on the computer, they put them in prison, and they died quickly.
The CDBS are still killing those who are trying to learn the truth about the crimes of the past century.
So why are you suddenly surprised at their actions now?
The most disgusting traits of human nature are concentrated there.
Slavery and imperial chowinism were imposed over the thousands of years of Ordinance from 16 to 19 centuries.
And then what happened was a beastly genetic experiment by cutting an intelligence out during a few waves of red terror.
Look at the Half-French Checist film of 1992, that's how it was.
Zo you saw my photos in the bathroom.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough?
I'm sorry. I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the kids went, because Galia knows they can't.
Igor, is it comfortable for you to go tomorrow?
It's very uncomfortable for us to bother you so much.
You're really helping us, thank you!

But it doesn't have to be, only if it happens, I'm very grateful to you, too.
I'm sure I felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed before him.

According to European Truth, Welt writes about this with reference to sources in Ukrainian government circles.
According to the publication, the proposal was sent to the Ministry of the Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 gaubines, including a set and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As are suggested by the Hubble in the BTR Boxer option for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in the fight are relatively close to the object of the opponents, Panzerhaubitze, 2,000 can fire more than 30 miles [30 km] away.
According to Ukrainian government circles with a reference to KMW proposal, the self-driven gaubys will go along the circular scheme.
The Bundesver will give Kiev 100 of its own, and the gaps that are formed will then be filled by the industry at the second stage.
The first new rabbis may be placed 30 months after the signing of the contract, that is, earlier than the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed by 2027.
Is that us the first half of the day, or the second half of the day together?

Lydia's already taken to school, but we're sick to go on Tuesday at the teacher's office today.
I'm sitting down, holding my earphones on my ears, listening to the music, and thinking about you and the children.
I really want to be with you.
To make you happy.
I don't know, darling, how are you?
I know it's hard for you.
But I'm treating it so that we're together.
I'd say there'll be a lot of work after the war.
So I'm not afraid I won't find her there.
I can do a lot.
So I am not afraid that I did not get into any of them.
I don't know what's going to happen to the house.
I need a food license test, can I do that?
Please tell me, tomorrow for five guests to cook the apartment.
Five places I understand in a TV room?
Placing and laying the couch?
Can we stay with you while Mrs. Margarita finds us a place?
Don't worry about it.
Not the new one that's already used, but he's working but he's not needed.
Write the address in Czech, look at the map where this is from us.
I don't know how much free space there's, so I can't plan with furniture wants to look at that apartment last week and then understand what furniture I need.
Sorry to answer for so long, working was a day, hard to adapt.
Is that enough yet?
I want you to be happy, I want you to be safe, and I want to finally be with you, to have such an opportunity to embrace you.
Kiss you in the morning, tell me how it suits you.
There's already a bed and a bathroom for the baby here, and I've first found it.
Don't forget what you promised to help me how you'll have the opportunity, but not the last thing to give
I want to make a box called a cap.
I don't want her to go with me.
Only I'll be a little bit later, about eight o'clock, can I?
I don't want to misunderstand you.
Because I'm worried that everything was good?
Because we didn't even talk to these excars!
I understand how important this is for you!
And I'm not talking about myself. (for me it's just a peak that I can't understand.)
After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was disappointed that Cole and I had a bad start in translating the test yesterday.
I will ask Gregory Danisenka or Jonaschek) to help me with some mathematical concepts.
Maybe I can be something useful to them too?
If this is possible, I want to pick up the mathematical terms in the weekend.
The geometry is hard at all, but we have to work with Coleaea without mistake.
Thank you for your test assignments.
We also look forward to it.
And so she's very happy to have any gift.
Jab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number.
Last night at 402 bus stops, I met a Ukrainian woman named Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is... her eyes are full of tears and sorrow...
I couldn't stay away.
Now we agreed to be friends.
And last night, I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person in Ukraine who felt my heart reciprocated.
The branch in Hall No. 29 is specifically designed to provide and process requests for assistance
turns out I ordered a backup card
Don't, I'm a simple man.
So she's not scared that no one came.
The main thing you taught me how to turn the oven on.
So you're leaving town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Memorial Center of the Holocaust, Babin Yar, in Kiev, we honored 80 years of mass shooting by Ukrainian soldiers of Ukrainian Jews at Babin Yara.
I had the privilege of following three heads of State, including the president of Germany.
He talked about "the foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, the peaceful and secure Europe.
That's the foundation that we have to protect is also part of our responsibility as part of our history."
If "the wicked demons of the past appear today in new clothes," he said, "then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The fight has to go on."
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombed and killed thousands of peaceful people, starved the inhabitants of its blocked cities, and let them die of disease.
The Russian forces are carrying out mass shots by Ukrainians, even visually like gunfire in Babino Yara.
Over a month, the Germans see it in the news in real-time mode.
Yes, Germany is implementing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, and weapons that have not been imagined for so long.
Germany is dragging away the heavy armaments needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to speak against the swastika.
This means fighting all possible means against massacres, genocide, war crimes, and atrocities.
There is no easy way to conquer evil and stop the atrocities that take place in Ukraine without the risks and victims.
One song to you at night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be assembled
Only Lydia did they have a omicron new kind of fiance.
Then I'll do it tomorrow.
I'm using this ticket instead of the plagues.
Vengeance for late documents.
The ticket cost me a guide of 2,000 wits
Sergei Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a far-reaching prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against NATO entrance, and only 18% of those interviewed were "for".
After the Revolution of Honority, Victor Janukovic, Krymian anexia, and the beginning of the war, the number of NATO opposers began to fall and the adherents, on the other hand, to increase.
Since the beginning of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists have recorded a record level of Ukrainian accession support to NATO among Ukrainian citizens - over 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine's NATO accession and the assistance NATO provides in the context of war, there is now a lot of criticism about the Alliance and the country's members -- about the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the reluctance to irritate Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to give up the desire for membership in the Alliance because of the RF position if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will be given reliable security guarantees, including the military.
In the new episode of the Bloody Questions, together with the editor of the European Truth, we talk about how Ukraine's Alliance had helped since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and why the Alliance is criticized in vain why our prospect of NATO membership is nearer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees that are being discussed at the Russian Army may become the second Budapest Memorandum.
How do you think it's here?
My partner in the volt is marked by what my Statement is under review.
I gave it to her through this mobile app
We need to go to the convention center and find out how to do this because it was formed in Poland, where visas were not given but were given.
We'll write to you!
Got Denis in a good mood today.
He agreed to meet a boy from Ukraine who was met yesterday at school to show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
That's how I don't like it. I don't have enough for a long time.
Ukraine reports that the Czech Republic sent T-72 tanks to Ukraine and freight machines
I'm going to leave the kids myself waiting there for three or four years and I'm going home because I can't leave them anymore.
And take it for six to seven years in the morning.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a heartfelt feeling toward this man, but he did not do well very well and I left him.
After a while, he returned and apologized to me.
I denied him.
After a while, he telephoned that he had a heart surgery.
He asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I had psychological support for him for nearly half a year.
During that time, we had a lot of communication.
At that time, I had problems at work in parallel.
His support also helped me at that time.
Such mutual assistance.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered me to get married, and two days later he died.
Thus, God himself chose our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
And he only speaks Czech.
I wanted to tell you that I was able to find a place, and that's what I'm very glad I've got to be with a baby right now.
Has I had to remember before?
) Because I've been helping to see children in the family.
Don't apologize, just write things you don't understand.
I understand for myself that the translator does not always translate the text correctly
I don't know how to talk to a doctor, or is it supposed to give a paper?
They must have forgotten the guests, I put them in the cabinet.
You may have to go to bed to work tomorrow.
Whether someone can help, the things needed for a woman's size XS or S is 165. And also for her daughters (8, 10, 12 years old)Thank you.
I bought two packs in the ice that time, and my mom bought two.
It's very nice of you, thank you.
You made me feel better.
All right, let's talk about something second, I don't sleep, I'm still asleep, and I'm dreaming of bombing...
God will never be late, for all things his time and place.
I don't think he wants to rob me:
I understand very well the value of unqualified work, and I realize that the job I had at home in Kiev I can't have here, and the money I made at home, I'm not going to get here right now.
But just sitting and not doing anything I can't do, because then all the bad thoughts in my head go, so you have to take on something physical.
At the airport, documents are issued from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., and at another time you can just wait.
Vladimir returned at 4: 00 p.m.
So we took them to our home.
We slept with Vic in the kitchen, put them in the bedroom.
I'll finish my job, and I'll go to Airport with them.
When you have it, write it down and find out what's next...
I can't find a place anymore.
Sir, these are the invitations of Ukrainian children to join the gymnasium.
Yeah, but I do it hard.
Okay, write me when it's convenient.

Can I call you?
Or can you write a contact with your wife?
I want to ask what I can buy in the pharmacy.
I want to ask for advice.
We have Anna as an indigenous name
She was handed over by Uncle from the house
They made the English version, added new partners
Write to him if you need something.
Just don't forget about me, please.
Is there a difference between Monday and Wednesday?
Thank you very much, you're doing a lot for our family!
To be in the pool, help is needed
But that's my thought.
She's home with my uncle's handing over the roller and the rolling board, and she's riding at her house, so it's got
I got up at 9:00, and I'm just cooking breakfast now.
I'm very ashamed you're talking to me on your weekend, and I hope I'm not too tired.
We want to report a change in the house and provide documents for the continuation of the map.
We're now giving medical oxygen to all hospitals in our country.
And I forgot to tell you that tomorrow will be a bite.
One mother said that she was smelling for children with dancing drills
He's visiting you.
Please say, and do you have an approximate cleaning schedule for the month ahead, though for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember this schedule.
The Russian army threatens to strike a missile against Kiev: they say, "Don't do that before."
And the direct language of Konaschenkova is, "We see the attempts of diversia and the task of blowing Ukrainian troops on objects in the RF.
If such incidents continue, the RF forces will strike in the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army had previously held itself."
The Russians have been rocketing Kiev from the first days of the total invasion of the RFs into Ukraine.
On February 25, Russian missiles that hit the Ukrainian APS system fell on a large apartment building on the capital Pozniks.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-story avenue at Valerie Lobanovski.
On March 1, the Russians took a television show on the roads near Babino Yar, killing five passersby.
On March 2, Ukrainian U.S. systems beat Russian missiles over the South Railway station flying in the directions of the Ministry of Defence.
March 14, the debris of the bombed missile of the occupants smashed the house and trolleybus in Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a housing block on the Vineyard, resulting in one death, another 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern TRC Retroville on the Vineyard, killing at least 4 people.
On April 13, the Mayor of Kiev Vitalius Clycco stated that the inhabitants of the capital who had evacuated from the city had yet to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians could still cause rocket strikes on Kiev and that there are many mines and unexploded warfare in the capital.
On April 12, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense’s Intelligence Directorate warned that the Russians planned to predominate a number of terrorist attacks in the RF to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against civilians.
On April 1, oil erupted near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, the local authorities of Belgorod claimed that the Ukrainian shell had fallen near the city.
Obviously, the elites in Washington and Berlin are thrown into the cold sweat from the very thought that the natal fighters would be beaten by Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Greensky isn't talking to them as much as with their voters and societies as a whole.
In his talks in parliaments and in front of the thousands of crowds in the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was not available to any of his predecessors.
Green doesn't convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convince the European nations that are chosen by those politicians.
And these talks, this elegant alloy of strength, touchingness, and times of despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Baiden is categorically against the closing of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels are opposed to Ukraine’s early accession, this process is already under way.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered fraudulent.
The cost you collect is better to give to people who need more.
I can come to you and we'll be there to decide.

You don't know if you feed them tomorrow or not.

These are heroic leaders who go to the battle zone without fear, calm down and help the refugees in the cars, and at peace stations help volunteers carry the humanitarian cars.
These are the trucks on the Zhitomir Race in the early days of the war, and they patiently served the frightened and upset people.
These are the communists who carry the garbage under fire, repair the water supply and the electrical transmission lines to ensure that people are needed.

The Ukrainian foreign electoral district (Ukraine) is a electoral district that brings together the electoral stations located outside Ukraine and consists of elections in embassies and consulates in Ukrainian and military bases abroad, where Ukrainian peacekeepers (Kosovo and D. Congo) are located.[1] The role of the District Electoral Commission for the Foreign Electoral District is performed by the Central Electoral Commission.
In the foreign electoral district, only public ballots are held: the election of the President and the national deputies and the Ukrainian referendum.
Local elections are not held.

The head of the Office of President Andrey Jermak reported that Russia was starting a "fighting operation" about the weapons that allies are handing us over.
Yermak's direct language is, "They understand that they are losing war, they see their backlog and they're trying to kill the supply of arms by any method.
For example, one of the last fairies is the fatigue of the S-300 SAD.
This information has already been refuted by premier Edward Heger.
We know the Russian scripts, I'll call one of them.
They may start frailies that Ukrainian soldiers are buzzing with arms from allies, and they are aggressively moving into the armed forces of the Russian army.
I want to warn them immediately.
Because the weapon in the hands of the SAR soldiers is exclusively sending the enemy to that world.

We cleaned the whole room and went into the second room free.
The international community continues to express shock and indignation after the evidence that the Russian forces have committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as “provocation. ”
“Reports of the murdered, raped and severely injured by Russian forces of Ukrainian civilians are worthy of condemnation,” stated New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to journalists in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer the world for what they did,” she added, noting that her Government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its struggle against Russian invasion.
Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kisida referred to incidents as “the breach of international law”.
The statements were made following reports that hundreds of peaceful residents were shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left in the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Buchy by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
Photographs that allegedly depict the bodies of civilians executed with tied hands shocked many and led to calls for more sanctions against Russia and the criminal persecution of the perpetrators.
President of France Emmanuel McRon stated in radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops committed “war crimes” in Buchy.
“What happened in Bogo calls for a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” said Macron, adding that additional sanctions should be directed towards Russian coal and oil exports.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain stated that Russian troops could go so far as they did a “genocide” in Buchy.
“We will make sure that those who have committed these war crimes do not remain unpunished, ” said Sanchez in Madrid.
Speaking on public television late in April 3, the spokesman Maria Zacharov of Russia rejected the accusation as “provocation. ”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “sent” images to discredit Russia.
“ In this case, I feel that the fact that these statements were made in the first minute after these materials appeared makes no doubt about the one who “closed ” this story, ” said Zechariah.
Previously, the Russian Minoбороns also asserted without evidence that the image of Buchy was “one more of the orders of the Kiev regime” and that all Russian troops had left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4, to discuss what it called “the provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Buchy.
On April 4, Russia’s follow-up committee issued a statement declaring “Investigation” of the allegations of Ukraine’s “recognized false information” about the actions of the Russian forces in Buchy.
On April 3, Vladimir Greensky, President of Ukraine, accused Russian troops of “genocida” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they would come to Buchy to see what their military forces had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are being carried out,” said Greensky in videotape, going from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there's a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shots in the back of the head," he said.
He stated that the President of Russia Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the military operations in Ukraine.
"When we find people with hands bound behind our back and unheaded, I don't understand," he said about the victims' scenes scattered on the streets of Buchy, about 35 kilometres northwest of Kiev.
On April 2, correspondent in the Ukrainian Liberty Council, found the body on the streets of a small town of civilians.
In just one place, the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
The AP journalists saw at least 21 people in different locations of Buchy.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all in the civilian — were scattered on the ground near a place that local residents described as using Russian forces as a base.
It seems that the victims were killed from a close distance.
In general, Ukrainian authorities stated that at least 410 peaceful residents were found in the area of Kiev, which had been controlled by Russian troops until last week.
Thank you, everything is, we've bought everything on the list.
"They were told, Kiev is not." As the occupants of the underground took the Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
Russian invasion is accompanied by frightening things: robbery, rape, murder, torture.
There is another point in this list, which is now much less information about — the removal of the local population into the enemy’s territory.
From mid-March, Russian occupants "evacuate" Ukrainians from temporaryly occupied settlements to their territory and territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually gave to the Russian military poligon.
"Ukrainian truth" found out the carved Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" is happening and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text have been voluntarily evacuated outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from non-recovery.
Fortunately, they live and maintain contact with their family.
However, in view of Ukrainian authorities’ claims, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under rigid coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity house, took away children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslav, the daughter of the dead champion of Ukraine from the voyage of Joseph Zachepinski.
Alexander's family, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Valy moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at Anton Airport, which is about 20 miles [2.5 km] from the village.
The family settled in a military town, although she was a civilian.
As true plastics, Denis and Marina had already collected worrisome suitcases beforehand, but on the morning of February 24th, they didn't have time to evacuate.
They had no automobile, and the suburb buses no longer took anyone.
About 12 o'clock on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin V followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17 until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In all, some 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not all of them decided.
"February 24th evening, people who spoke and not Russian or Ukrainian, came into the drive.
They say, "Who is?" "I say so." "Come out!"
They searched me and asked who was in the basement if there was a weapon.
All men were questioned whether they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We're here to protect you by the order of Ramsan Kadyrov."
It was a Chechen OMON, not even a military force, young boys 25 to 35 years old.
They said, "On our way to war, we were helped by the Ukrainian people, Sasko Billy, who was commanded by the nationalist team of the Wicking, who fought on the side of Chechens in the first Russian-China war, UP, and now we're helping you."
On the third day, they asked what we needed.
We say the water, it was a big problem.
They broke the store, they took the goods under the pretext, they took the Russians anyway, and they brought us six bottles.
There's a video on the Internet where kids thank the Cadyro for food.
So they're after the robbery of the store, they brought a sausage and they say, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramsan Ahmatovic."
No one especially wanted to speak, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child says, "You have seven days to give up our phones," they laughed.
Still, they kept separate from the Russians.
They said how well they came, because they didn't want wars, the Ukrainians are backed up, and the good people are saying, "Putin is a bastard, Kadirov, too, but we can't do anything, because our families are there."
And mostly, they didn't fight, they were driving shops, they were looting.
One was tied up to one leg of the Georgi ribbon and one of them was her white stalk and called her militia.
They were not trained at all in Ukraine.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... when they were beaten on the Buchi, so that they didn't even take the dead, they said to us, "You have artillery?"
More than that, we had erected troops — the chequets among themselves did not know, in the first days they asked passwords to discover whether they were their own or not.
We had them until March 13 and then the Russian OMON came and followed them by the Om's desant.
They put 30 to 40 units of equipment between houses -- ours were constantly hit by the Bairaktars.
But they came and told us that there's no SSO, but there's "Aze" and they say "Azza" is like thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
Kyiv's already surrendered. He's been on his way from the beginning of March.
One day a Russian officer, or an officer of the desent, or a representative of the FSB, came to us and said that there would be evacuation.
And we listened to the radio -- there was a Bohu, Gostomel, thought maybe we were given a green corridor.
From the very beginning, we gave Chechens our lists, they promised to contact Ukrainian command.
But we're told, "You're being taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don't want to go there or there.
And they said, "Spoil your children's mentality!"
As it worked, they stole us into the basement and started shooting from underneath the house - or "Gradamis," or by minomets.
And then it came back... and the neighborhoods just burned up, and some of them collapsed.
There was a direct hit on the third floor in our house.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to transfer the borders and the Red Cross.
The part didn't leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland, saying, "you're gonna be shot and sold to the organs."
We were transported through Chernobyl, along both sides of the road there were burns, broken equipment, even though the Belarusians told us that the Russians were transporting technology immediately.
A lot of caponists, fossilized equipment, and soldiers.
At the Belarusian spot of Comar, we passed improvised control, many of them were not documented at all because they burned.
We were placed in the tabernacles of the Red Cross, and we were given tea.
And here we hear the shots, it shoots the rocket, and we can see that it was the Diskander working on Kiev.
Although these of the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, it's planes flying, it turns around on the border."
But we're from aviation, we have education, we know what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the Chunky sanatorium near Gomel.
His leader, Hunger Vassil Stepanović, came and said, "Here, I'm a hochole, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenk will not stop until these thieves get killed.
The poor people are suffering!
We've got Lukashenko so good!
He will say so."
They offered to interview Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The sanatorium administration said to us, "You're traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the United Nations (at least so called) spread misinformation that men in Poland could not drive.
Many believed it and feared to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a document problem — the daughter had no foreign passport.
We had to get it on Monday, and the four of us started the war.
In the Ukrainian Consulate, we were not helped, but in Minsk at the station we were told that no one would be taken to the bus without passports.
Here I'll tell you that Belarusian volunteers have been very helpful.
We were settled in Minsk, and the escort was carried out.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
Our second migratory representative said that you can live here at least a week and a half because Belarus is not Europe, there's no payment here.
We found an internal transporter who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Walking near Mozire (about 50 miles [50 km] from the Ukrainian border — UP), we saw ballistic missile launches in Ukraine: the rocket first flew, beautifully shining, and then extinguishing.
People sitting on a bus in Moziri told me that the Russians there were constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians don't want to fight at all.
The generals are freed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if they called him.
But the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You lie, we are a peaceful people."
They do not understand that their polygons are used to fire Ukrainian fires.
In Poland, friends who took us to Estonia waited for us.
Now we go through the registration, decide what we're going to do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are probably as many as the Estonian flags."
Marina lived in a military town in Gostomel with her brother's family, his wife and two children, 18th and 22nd.
On the morning of February 24th, she called the nephews and asked them to collect the most important things and documents.
Tonight, they went to sleep in the basement of a neighboring house.
Marina was unable to return home, and in principle she won't be able to go home anymore.
No one really knew anything about evacuation.
Can't you get to the center on Monday?
Thank you, we've got everything. And in the guest we're always waiting for you!
Thank you for the deal, the moths are beautiful.

On April 1, the city head of Buchy Anatolia Fedoruk announced the thrilling message that the Ukrainian military released the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupants were expelled from all over the Kiev region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians would have felt at this time was eclipsed by terror and hatred, as it was also known that at least 280 peaceable residents were shot in Buchy alone.
They were killed on the street, some were tied up and shot in the back of the head, and some of them were killed, teenagers.
The statues of the village of Motín Olgu Suhenko, her husband, Igor, and the son of Alexander, were killed and followed.
The bodies of Olga and Alexandra were in a brotherly tomb, Igoria in sewers.
Both sides of the 20 kilometres of Kiev revealed the bodies of several scattered women enveloped in the blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, there's no one home.

President Vladimir Greenski stated that certain types of armaments that western partners provide came too late.
He said this in an interview by the Associated Press, whose passages were published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth."
"All the equipment they've sent already, for some kinds of equipment it's done too late.
So what do we say, for example, about Mariopol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100 percent support, that's true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the value of these changes," said Greenski.
On the question of, it's got enough weapons to get Ukraine to make a difference in the war, the president said, "No, not yet."
The President also said that, if Ukraine was a member of NATO, this war would not have been, or it would have been different.
"She would've turned around differently, we'd have a shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I'm sure there wouldn't be wars," he added.

Okay, I just need to print pictures for kids, so it'll be good when you can come.
But perhaps you need more knowledge of the Czech language.
I'm trying to make you happy with my job.
In this case, I know a girl who's a Ukrainian, but I'm studying in Czechia, on the speciality of tourism.
You really don't want to come for a moment with your kids and your grandmother.
I want you to be with me.
It's hard to do in a foreign land, and every day it's going to get home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you want this picture, I'll take a picture.
Thank you for trying to make our life here as much as possible.
I'll remember you for a lifetime.
And, I'll mention and smile
So thank you so much for Ania to take the route in the telephone so we can get to it quickly.

"I'm telling her that TV and radio refurbishment has been pulled through import details, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to vouch for anything else when they call."
"We've been hiding a month from the infu of war.
So far, it's going to work.
However, in the Blaze (wheel - UP) on the powder and back paws, the fur may be a result of stress, changes in food, and a lack of vitamins.
The last two causes are removed, but the stress on me does not depend, unfortunately.
Unlike a candle, it's not deaf, it hears both sirens and explosions."
Thanks to Olga's poor hearing and spending most of her time in her room, her fiancée month lived with her incognito.
And on April 1th, 93-year-old Oksana Paulov took the gun for the first time in her life.
"Thirty-three days I lived with her in the apartment, like a guerrilla.
War was hidden from her, and the fact that I was there was as formally as always for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver -- she listened for four hours, then she sang for two hours."
The radio was always at the bed.
Most of the time she spends in her room.
It's bad for me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her walkers, I was hiding in my room.
First of all, I hid a receiver and a TV.
And then I called everyone who's talking to her, and it's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything, but not war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end.
It's April 17 -- I've got two apartments cleaning:
Good evening, I didn't think of that somehow,
Hi, if we still need our help tomorrow, we can come.

I'm proposing male, female, child strokes with you, all of those who have been stirred, I ask you to write in a personal message, the price:
I understand and don't complain, but in my case, I'll be looking here for you.
I tell you the Embassy is here.
A British who defended Mariopol in the VSO lava says that he is ready to surrender to the Russians
The British, who is a military brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces Armed Forces Brigade, who is involved in Maríupoli’s defense, told his friends and family that they would lay their arms and surrender to the Russian occupyers.
Source: The twitter page of Eidin Ayslin, the British who has served in the U.S.A. лав since 2018, the BBC with reference to Auslin's family and friends, Atlas News, with a reference to the words of the second Ashlin who spoke to him.
It's literally twitter Eyslin's saying, "We got a message from him, 48 days passed, we tried everything we could to protect Mariopol, but we don't have a choice, except to surrender to Russian troops.
We have no food and no ammunition left.
Thank you all, hopefully the war will end soon."
Icelin served in the 36th separate SPA Brigade, which is involved in Maríupoli's defence operation.
The BBC journalists contacted the mother of the military officer An Wood, and she confirmed that her son on the phone said that they were going to get captured.
A military friend, Brenan Philips, also confirmed to journalists that in the last telephone conversation, Icelin spoke about plans for their capitulation unit.
He said that the brigade ended with ammunition and food.
The journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Ashlin unit was going to be captivated by Russian subunits, so that it would not be without weapons and bullets to the hands of the so-called "caderils."
The social network also promoted an audio recording of telephone conversation, where Eislin allegedly talks to his acquaintance American friend who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
The British used to tell him that instagram he was threatened by the private military company Vagner.
Aslin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottingemshire, but in 2015-2017 he went to fight the so-called "Islam State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially entered the VSL and made a vow.
Ashlyna's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he's more famous under Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.

I wanted to come to you, but I wanted to handle some things.
I'll ask the man in the morning if he'll be there tomorrow.
When you come home, write to me, please, I need to talk to Daniel.

Okay, I'm sure I'll ask him.
As soon as we get together tomorrow night, I'll get him and Tuesday.
I want me to be able to thank all who helped us, because that was the last hope, the truth.
I am not afraid of work, as I lived in the village, so I can work physically.
When You Can Bring Things
You have a very interesting tradition, we're going to Christmas like this.
Last week, the Supreme Council approved legal project 7,176, entitled "To monitor potential threats to Ukrainian national security in the economy."
It's strange that, in fact, the only potential threat to Ukrainian national security in the economy has been found... the place where the supervisory boards meet.
Legislators believe that decision-making by the Supervisory Council in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve Ukrainian national security problems.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for holders, but until no company is aware of the need to exercise physically at the location of the supervisory board.
The potential threat from this law is understood to be a great basis for "removing" all the gains in the difficult reform of the aftermath of the Revolution of Honor, including independent council supervisors, and then to establish manual management.
The one that was before 2015.
Why should the boards keep watch, and who should join them?
More than that, if under patriotic slogans "flys" one harmful law project, others can fly tomorrow -- for example, the public procurement system can be dismantled through ProZorro or the independence of the NBO.
A lot of things can be said to be warfare.
And by the way, this initiative has emerged before the war and the law process of 7176.
So on February 22, this rule was applied to a comparative table of 5397.
In general, the desire to disperse the Council’s supervision in some ways has been circulating among some national candidates for a long time.
Not for criticism as such, but to show the possible consequences of a law - affiliation, let us consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then let's give our suggestions on how to deal with the management of security entrepreneurship during the war.
The first deputy minister of the economy, Denis Kudin, explained the need for innovation by risking the loss of the Internet and other communication tools that would make it impossible for the remote work of the supervisory boards.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board can't make the necessary decisions because the company's work can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but can he prevent the movement of the supervisory council to Ukraine?
Imagine a pretty cynical situation when independent members of the oversight board (most of the total) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In such a case, they can be released under the law.
And then, it's likely that this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory council to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the oversight board, as the law requires a competitive selection, which is, on average, three to four months.
Thus, the decision of 7,176 proposed by the law will likely not be able to save the loss of the supervisory council’s ability to make decisions, and it will rather do so!
People's deputy, the author of the law project, Dmitro Nataluch, gives other arguments for his support.
In particular, he says, "a lot of enterprises, such as the OPC, now need relocation," and that's why it's hard to imagine, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss locations and other sensitive information."
In Ukraine, for the first time, there are almost no ODC businesses with the Council’s supervisors.
The board's supervisory board is except in the Ucroponprome, which essentially manages almost all of the OPK businesses.
But even in the Ucroponproma, according to legislation, the Board of Supervisory Services has quite limited powers, and all its members are not free of charge.
The fullness of power in the Ucroporonroma is the Director-General who will, by the way, decide whether to relocate a OPK company that is part of a conservative.
Moreover, this argument does not stand up to criticism because of the fact that OPK’s legislation has not changed at all.
Mr. Dmitro on his Facebook page also gives arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments tend to have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of holders and holders, but let's try to figure out some of them: "Deserved Foreign Experts in the first word of War," left Ukraine in 2021, but they remain members of the supervisory councils in Ukrainian state enterprises with a full salary of several hundred thousand dollars, while Ukraine itself is really suffering from war."
First, it's manipulation -- most of these supervisory council members have never lived in Ukraine and only occasionally arrived here.
So to say they're leaving Ukraine, softly speaking, unfairly.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian supervisors have long used online meetings.
This tool has long been common in the world’s practice, with its entirely different spheres of business, education, medicine, and so forth.
And we should not forget that membership in the supervisory council is not a full-time job.
Usually, these people have other jobs, and just the means of electronic communication help them to do that.
Thirdly, all of these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
Interestingly, why does Mr. Dmitro not make identical claims to members of the Ukrainian governing body?
Because they aren't at the place where they're located their companies.
In fact, it's not the first pulistic attempt of deputies to remove foreigners from supervisory councils, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.
Congratulations, I'm in Ukraine looking for options for temporary shelter in my family, two children with me.

In Brovarski, Vishgorod, and Buchan in the region of Kiev, exempted from occupation, an increased curfew will take place for two days.
"In the populace of Brovarski, Visgrod and Buchan districts under Russian occupation and released by the Ukrainian Defence Forces, the curfew has been increased!
In the area of these cities and villages, the restrictions will take place from April 21:00 to April 6.00, 5th."
Details: According to the head of the raid, it is categorically forbidden to stay on the streets of the community and in other public places, travel and walk.
The residents can go outside only when an alarm signal is signaled to take refuge.
Such restrictions are imposed to remove the consequences of the Russian aggression — to clear and unchange territories.
The Omelianucus called on the people who had left these areas for the time being to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of Kievland, curfews will last from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.

Lukashenka’s regime has delayed three bilours for 27 and 28 years, resulting in the destruction of two rear - line cabinets under Osipovice, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Swaboda", the Visional Law Security Center, the chief of the IBC Criminal Police, Hennadi Kazakević, quoted by the Belta holder information agency
The IBC of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three people in Bobruiska were detained, one injured.
According to Victim, when men were delayed, they were actively opposed and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were provided with local medical assistance.
The IBS Chief of Criminal Police of Belarus, Hennadi Kazakević, stated that “the acts of terrorism in the Railway of the RB will be severely suspended” by armed forces.
On April 6, it was known that on March 30, the police detained another Belarusian railway co-worker, a staff member of the BWD Baranovic and the BWD administrator of thematic resources at VContíe and Students Valentine Samusuk.
Where he is now and in which state he is unknown, tells @belzhd_live.
By the end of March, at least 40 railroad workers were detained in Belarus for diversia.
Remind: The formation by the Lukashenka Extremitic regime by BYPOL continues to call on the bilorus to conduct divers in railway and Belarus's infrastructure as part of the Victory Plan.
Belarusian "reeut guerrillas" are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.

U.S. forbids investments in the R.F. and sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, together with G7 and the EU, has introduced new sanctions against the daughters of President RF Putin, the largest banks of the Alpha Bank and Swierbank, and forbids all new investments in Russia.
That's what this is about on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alpha Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets that relate to the U.S. financial system and will ban U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the States will impose a full ban on new investments in the RF.
To that end, U.S. President Joe Bayden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of where they are.
"This step is based on a decision made by over 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers, such as legal and consulting firms,” is the White House statement.
The third step of the new U.S. sanctions was the restrictions on major Russian government critical enterprises.
This will ban U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the States.
A detailed list of Minfin will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of the full-year-old children of Putin, the wife and daughters of the Foreign Minister of Lavrov, and the members of the Russian Security Council, including the ex-president and Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Missutim
Sanctions remove them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all the assets they have in the United States.

I think it's better for you to make copies of our passports, they have all the information.
I didn't change my name, it's one of my births:
Mr. Reirard, I'm sorry I haven't seen it.
We're going to the medical station right now.
I mean, I need Ani to work this hour on another day.
What day would it be better for her to come before?
Tomorrow I'll listen to the Internet.
You're what you're gonna do.
Thank you... something found out of things, but there was nothing from technology...
Both beginners, except the alphabet, know nothing
Nothing's happening.
Can I go to Monday, 25.04?
Kids can be taken with you, toys are enough:)
Finding My Daddy
I'm probably very naive or very in love, but I'll come up with this money.
We'll do it somehow.
But when this is paid, please, no loans.
Write it straight, and I'll help you.
We're your partner or I'm not your partner.
I don't know.
Should we take the clothes we gave?
It's not my day. It's broken in the living room. It's one in the morning.
I don't see anything coming from you.
I’m also very sad
Remind you of the facture later.
You're the only one who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to clean the house and how many windows do the house have?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't share it with you, there's a message from Mariopolis for a son alive and in line.
I'm recommending to read Joe Dispenso, he's doing scientific research on the impact of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections.
Natalia Nagorna's television station journalist "1+1" published a video on April 12th on the morning that she received from the 36th brigade of the Maríupoli sea infantry.
They are said to have no weapons left to share in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "the account goes for an hour."
Before that, on April 11th, a special brigade of the marine infantry who participates in Maríupoli's defense published an appeal to the Ukrainians in Russian.
It was stated that April 11 could be the last fight for Mariupoli defenders, and the Ukrainian military command was not connected to the fighters for two weeks.
Skepsis was expressed in the social media that the application was published in Russian.
The Chief Commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Valerie Zaruzny, assured us that the connection of command with the defence forces in Mariopolis is, and the details of the defence operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters in the Azusstal factory in Maríupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupants dropped the poisonous substance of unknown origin on Maríopol.
According to Andrey Belecki's leader Andrey, the RUF has used chemical weapons over the Azstal factory, which keeps the Azov battalion.
Thank you, I'm gonna make it up to you.
The situation is the same. We're staying here.
( 2 hours riding ) walk, Mom shopping, and back!)
It's not important.
She forgot what she'd do here.
The Czech drone’s Escadrilia from today began to fly over Ukraine.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used to detect, and some of them will be used to directly destroy an enemy invader.
Two of the Czech brothers and two of them were sent to Ukraine from the day before, thanks to the deputy of the Mukachev Urban Council, Vladimir Labutenka.
Today, their inter-girl friends, led by the executive of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/Bysil Schurr, delivered the drones to their destination: they were given special units of Ukrainian troops in various cities where there are now fighting.
In order to make the most effective and safe use of copters, they're going to be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army in Czechia do not plan to stop, say that in the nearest days to Ukraine, many more interesting gifts will serve as the destruction of the Russian occupant and the preservation of the lives of the Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, everything's okay, I love sweet, but I can do it without him.
I'm worried we're not going to make it.
I'm going back to Ukraine, and I'm still working.
All right, if it's okay, I'll agree.
I'll try, but if there's a problem, I'll write it to you if I can?
The Key to Understanding One Another
We were personally in the lady of old in the village of Iowa, she saw me and that I was pregnant but she said there was no dwelling.
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll be upset.
I got the phone repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing on the street today.
I drank medications and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but it's better to meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, put me down the music you like.
I'm interested in how much music you've got.
Mom and Dad Need to Obey
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
It was cooler tonight and rain.
But it is not a pity for the ruined homes, the pity of the people who are being mistreated by the occupants
In Herson, the occupants were wrecked with the Lord of Ukraine's memorial in Herson on the street of Percopska.
Details: It's noted that the unknown broke the European Union flag, smashed the panels with photographs of the Celestial Celestial hundreds and killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants have erased portraits of the Heavenic heroes of the hundreds and dead members of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The flag has been dropped.
Good morning, thank you kids for cartilage, we don't have that custom so we didn't know, we gave the kids only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given.
There's someone to talk about.
'Cause I live a type in the grocery house till the twelve here will be people, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I've been in a manger today.
Even today I've slept there.
So we have great progress.
I'm sure I'm going to get the varieties another time!
Mayday I have no power to do them.
Since I have a day - to - day cleaning work after the guests, I can say about April the month because I have an approximate cleaning schedule for the apartments.
On May, I can say about the end of April or early May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I haven't said I've been cooking dinner for a while and I've slept a little bit.
If you don't mind, can I come today?)
or I'll meet you after you're here.)
He's modest, he's been learning a lot lately.
Hi.) It went very well.
I was a little shocked that I was working with people at such a high position.
Today, a lady who is the director of the Economy of the Economy has learned a lesson.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grisk in a manger behaved well.
On Monday, I'm going to have to bring confirmations of employment and cash payments for the nursery.
I'm lazy on Friday.
I don't do anything but a lot of them, and I sleep . (and I drown a lot of water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
If they're going to see a doctor tomorrow, I'm leaving with you, if you can.
I have to get another analysis.
You don't have to go again.
It works very badly, it's washing off, you need a master.
So there's enough there.
Can you send me a correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you're in.
And are children fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now there's one question for a moment to come to you.
If There Is Still a Need for Help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating the Passover today, right?
From the beginning, we didn't really want you to collect money so people don't think we're hot on it!
But for online filling, I didn't have enough of two things:
I'm going to go to rest, get the strength and energy, thank you for the present present.
That's a great idea, I'm going to watch the video, and it's going to be good, because the whole family is going to be drawing.
The Karasin University calls on employees and students to carefully check any information, not trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossips.
Only look at official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother who stays in Ukraine also helps the army.
Collected some work for the portfolio.
The Internet is supposed to be held after the holidays.
I'd like to be your backup designer.
As I'm counting the day I wasn't at work is a pass
Consolidation of headquarters: Russia is preparing provocation in Prinistrov to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army can provocate in the Princestrov region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of "aggression against the neighbouring state."
It's literally: "No exception is made by the armed forces of the Russian Federation to conduct provocative action in the Princestrov region of Moldova for the purpose of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighbouring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create a successive group of troops for action in the Slavonic direction.
Probably in the nearest days, occupants will try to reintroduce the attack.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send a special warehouse, armaments, and equipment to participate in warfare in Ukraine.
Arms and military equipment are being prepared at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate Motor Shot Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
The weapons indicated are likely to be moved into the temporary occupied area of the Donetsk region.
Also to restore the loss of the special unit of the battalion tactical group from the 36th separate motor shooting brigade (Borgia, Zabayqala province), a set of military personnel from the designated brigade is carried out by the 29 General Army of the Eastern Military District.
The enemy feels a special problem when he sets up the positions of drivers and driver mechanics.
The selection of a special warehouse from a permanent distribution point is scheduled for the second half of April of this year.
Perhaps the opponent will continue to hit traffic infrastructures in Ukraine to destroy or dismantle trucks.
Defined units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian and Belarusian borders in the Brest and Gomel districts.
In the Slovorian direction, separate subdivisions from the 6th General Army and the coastal forces of the North Navy continue to block the city of Harkova, and the artillery shells of individual districts of the city continue.
In the Izuma direction, an air survey of the area is being carried out to identify the positions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.
The opponent uses Orlan 10 to do that.
With the strength of two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack in the directions of the Long and Dmitrewk settlements, and he did not have success and went back to his previously occupied positions.
In the Danish direction, the opponent continues to focus his main efforts on taking control of the settlements of the Pozna, Rubizne, Lower and Novobachutica, as well as establishing full control over the city of Marioupol.
The enemy tried to attack the Golden region, and he was not successful.
In Marioupol, with the help of artillery and air, the occupants continue to attack the Azusstal factory and the seaport.
The forces of individual divisions, the enemy, carried out artillery shellings of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the Highscopic, Labour Lover, and Marian.
In the Donetsky and Lugan districts, Ukrainian defenders in the past day have taken four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored tanks, six automobile units, and eight enemy artillery systems.
Didn't you understand your thoughts?
We're sure we're gonna try to make it, but I'm doubting.
And how can you sleep, and I'm keeping you.
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me tonight, so tell me, I'll understand.
We didn't watch TV at home, and the more 1 plus 1 don't have to set up:
I'm going to turn on the TV solely to listen to the Czech language.
I've got a bag of tariffs tonight:
Can we do this on the phone today?
Buying a tissue for elevation, a canvas, a thread for elevation
I understand that I can prepare the material in this field.
I'm a little embarrassed to ask her, and she gives us so many pies.
I'll meet my father, I'm sure.
I've read a Facebook announcement, that Google probably wrote something on its own, I think the phone number is enough.
Good day, we've got the things you've brought, but there's things that are small in us in 10 minutes to bring them to you?
I thought about my job.
If Mr. Director arranges, I can start my job from the next week because tomorrow before lunch, I plan to go to the office to present documents (if I get a lot of turns) and on Saturday rain:
I was looking for a brigade at the beginning, and I really liked chemistry at the school, studying Czech, to know perfectly, the dream of working on Teva.
Friends of old and not so much, friends who I don't know personally, friends by spirit and mind.
Now you've got a hard time too.
I've been talking to a lot of you in the last month.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from its feet to its head, as is the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing from Russia.
And many of you have admitted that they feel guilty and embarrassed because of the actions of your country in relation to your neighbors.
Because of why they give Ukraine your name.
Some of you activists have been threatened for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote Alexandra Chercasov, my very old friend from the "Memorial."
I'll tell you a little bit later — as usual, Sasha replied slightly. — Now, after searching, we go in ruins.
Others are cultural leaders, artists, critics, writers — impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let's be honest: except for the very few of you — those who worked in "Momorial," in New newspaper, in "Echo Moscow," in "Medouga," in Naval and in other places — have many of you done anything to resist this regime?
Besides participating in the rally, when they were still.
Read also the column of Russian journalist "Last Hide, Too Late to Silence."
And if so, you're sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive cohesion, which may have been a heavy burden on your soul and heart now?
That was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period of time when you had a degree of freedom and democracy -- a chaotic even bloody but real.
But 1991 didn't turn out to be better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you're finally so fearful of sorrow that you're looking for salvation behind the king's back, let's say his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he killed, you still feel safer around him.
Truly, there were mistakes.
Instead of seizing and publishing the KGB archives, as did the Germans from the strain, you took the soul to the monument of Zerzhinsky -- and let the KGB lie down on the bottom, update, transform and take power over the country.
When you were put before the choice between the country's robbery and the return of the Communists, you did not fight for the third option -- and you humbly agreed to the robbery.
In 1998, your economy fell, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
Survival was a major concern.
And then Putin came up, the young, the entrepreneur, the aggressive, he promised to break up with the terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but either you voted for it or you preferred not to vote at all.
When he started comparing Chechnya again with the earth, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I worked in Chechnya to help those who were suffering from aпутin anti-terrorist operation, and I saw with my eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I went back to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the tortures of peaceful people, the murdered children, the soldiers who sold the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Bред, we're already tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
And I resented, "Friends, this isn't my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid alien here.
It's your authority that bombs one of your cities, kills your fellow citizens."
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn't want to know anything.
Then came the economic upturning of the middle of the zero, caused by rising oil prices and by Putin's willingness to look through the throat, that part of the money stolen would remain in middle class pockets.
Many of you have become well - earned, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have acquired a new home and have found a better job.
Prices were growing, but was it a disaster?
The Moscow festively shining and shining from the neck.
When a number of opposers were killed — Yuriya Chekochina, Anna Polyticovsky, Alexander Lithuanianca, and others — many of you were shocked and horrified about what had happened.
Yet, the matter was not going on.
When after two terms, Putin handed over President Medvedev's post and took the premiere's place, I see you barely noticed it.
When after a few months of the reign of Medvedev Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or silenced it.
How many of you have met in the next years on the Hudouri mountain slopes, in Kazbega suburbs, or in the cafe and in the Turkish Tbilisi baths, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we don't have much to do in the West if we've ever done anything.
A little indignation, a little sanction; but what was the significance of Russia’s flagrant violation of international law when such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas, and the inner market?
It was good to live in Russia.
And after the difficult 1990s, that was the most important thing.
But at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, are still awake.
When Putin changed his seats again with Medwedev and planted a presidential chair as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went out massly to protest.
The name Naval became obsessive, you didn't walk from the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt horrible to lose the ground underneath.
Then he struck in reply.
At first, alternative stocks were organized, and more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were in jail.
Some received huge terms.
"What could we do?"
I've heard it so often, I can still hear it.
"The state is so strong and we're so weak."
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Annoyed by the prorosian president, who cheated their European expectations, they once captured Midane — and never left him again.
They set up a tent town on their own and prepared themselves for a firm defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of wands, rations, and molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police fired.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters were attacked.
Many died, but they won.
The fugitives became Yanukovich, and the Ukrainians returned democracy, the right to choose and drive leaders, if they do their business badly.
Midan was very displeased with Putin.
That was a bad example.
So, using the general confusion, he captured Krym.
Some of you were opposed, but the benefits were few.
How many of you were fascinated!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the anexia.
Then suddenly a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his chick came back to 180 degrees and began to love him.
I find it hard to find a reason because immediately afterward we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were basically silent.
"We're not interested in politics," you said.
And you've been hiding a new place in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, like new ones after the resurgence that Moscow's mayor began in 2012, with their binges, the commonly available cyphoid and the Hipper cafe.
Actually, Donbas is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful, and it's just getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
IDIL or something there... even a Moscow editor who released my book about Syria, criticized it in an interview, because I had no idea what happened in Syria.
Well, at least, I went there and I saw the state snipers shooting coldly in my kids' ages on the streets of Homs.
Among all Russian citizens there were only your soldiers who, in 2015, bombed thousands of people of peace, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of pastor Martin Nimeller:
"The first time they came to the socialists, but I said, because I'm not a socialist.
Then they came to the union members, but I spoke because I'm not a member of the union.
Then they came for the Jews, but I spoke because I'm not a Jew.
And then they came for me, but there's no one left to say anything to my defense."
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you did it.
But the vast majority spoke.
Some actually say right now — like Dmitro Glukhovski, Michael Schishkin, Michael Zigar, Maxim Osip, and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the inside of the country like Marina Owfulnikova, risking entering a new GULAG or forming a company of Naval.
As for others, you know best the country in which you live.
So, I'm sure you understand that when Putin is dealing with the Ukrainian people, or that it seems very likely if he doesn't get it, he'll take you.
For all of you, my friends, for those who are courageous, but mostly in private, they're still in a slight time, but they're going to get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement in social media (here even a black square in Instagram) or who spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
At times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were simply anecdote, they were not in such a distant past — and now they are very likely to look forward to you in the future.
Who's going to speak for you?
The example of Ukrainians — even more than 2014 — is frightening the Putinian regime: they prove that they can fight it.
And that the mind, motivation, and bravery can stop him, no matter how oppressive he is on paper.
Considering everything, few in Russia are aware of this, as is the fact that war is going on at all.
But you, my friends, know well what's going on right now.
You're reading offline news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you're in contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know what it's going to do.
A good life in exchange for your silence came to an end.
Your elections are just hohma, your laws, if not repressive, cost no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media are gone, your economy is ruined faster than I write, you have no more credit cards to buy a ticket for a plane abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence; he will demand your consent, your obedience.
And if you don't give him what he wants, you can try, or you can go, or you'll be crushed.
I doubt you see another option.
Still, there is another.
Which will eventually break this regime.
And maybe in the circumstances you're going to need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark is not coming from you: because of the economic collapsion that comes to Russia, it's most likely to burn in the province, in small cities.
When prices go down and the wages don't pay, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the street.
Putin knows that and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle-class Moscow and St. Petersburg, you, my friends.
But if every city goes on the rally itself, as it has been periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
An organization and coordination will be required. The crowd will have to be converted into mass.
You have this great magical tool, the internet, which mode can limit, but which is still working and can be set up in almost any circumstances.
The Naval organization was shattered, but we can create other, more informal, more decentralized.
You're a lot of people, you're millions.
The Moscow police can deal with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps hundreds of thousands.
If it's over 300,000, it's going to be shocked.
We'll have to use an army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to it?
After all that he had forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he had forced them through?
Of course, the danger will be great.
Many of you will have a sense of fear; but those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, it's normal.
I'd be afraid in your place, too.
In the case of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master who dare not only to demand freedom but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of countless people will still be lost in vain.
Your son's going to play a joke in a chat of a computer game - and he'll be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet - and will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake - and will die in a raw cell under the police tubes.
That's what's been happening for many years, and it's just going to get bigger and bigger.
So you don't have a choice, and if you don't do anything, you know what it's going to end up.
Act in cold blood, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were at the class Friday, and we were told that we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.
That you see me as the secretary's press.
Age, how often do you go to a expensive restaurant?
One time I go to dinner at a dear restaurant.
I'll try to explain it to her.)
So we liked it very nice and we wanted something better, so it's a better option.
I was in a room where there were many people, and I was tired of energy.
I feel bad about myself, coughing, temperature, voice disappeared, weakness, and head spinning
I have to go to that government of work.
We already did it, but we said who registered in April received money only at the end of the month.
On Thursday we need a pass, and we go to a doctor with our children.
But at night I was writing to a lady who liked your job, and she wanted something from you in her house.
I'm waiting for her to report new news and I'm sure.
As I worked in the Attorney's Office, I thought I was building a career, and I spent a lot of time and energy.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a very sad time lost, but it's a lifetime experience.
In my personal life, I am communicable, but I take the same love and the questions of marriage seriously.
There was a man for whom I was supposed to marry, but he died, a heart problem.
I think that in order to create a family, people should love, respect, trust each other.
I haven't met that before.
Good day: Where is Yiglava available for the baking of a graze (paper or silicon)?
All right, thanks for the advice, I'm going to get a witness to Vala now.
She has a CPU in lying state, she now has a knife broken in a plaster, a wheel in the lying position, the food is all overwhelmed in a blender.
Mr. Reyhard, I'm sorry I'm bothering you in a rough time.
But I have an important question to you.
I went to the game room in Natalie to say hello to her today.
She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the baby because she said she came to look at things and lay them in that room with clothes, and Mr. Valerie opened our child's room yesterday until 7:00.
Could that be so?
The room's working hours until 4:00.
Finally, this is our responsibility.
But I don't load a page that's very weak on the Internet.
Cola's working well, she's filled out the invitations yesterday, and I've been doing with the older men before the exam at the gymnasium.
It's harder to figure out the geometry.
Vladimir helped us on Saturday.
Age is studying universities and high school programs.
Can we pay for the apartment and wf?
We Are Thankful for the Housing
Yeah, but I thought you didn't fill in.
We're going to try to get as much money as possible by the end of the week to calculate
The situation concerning Russian invasion — Briefing by Head of Office of President Alex Arrestović (10.4.2022)
The president's chief adviser, Ofis, told me about the heroic act of the chief officer of the encroachment forces in Mariopolis -- he was surrounded and wounded, so he blew himself up with the radio station so that he wouldn't get to the opponents.
I have a very important question, will I be able to put on the account of my granddaughter for five years (Bronchial asthma) in her head right now and her womb and chips...
We need a family doctor for her who's going to understand a little Ukrainian or Russian.
The doctor needs urgent counsel to be very concerned about her condition.
We live in Czech Dolni Chabry. We need a doctor whose doctor is about here in Dolni Chabry, or maybe around Brno, but not far from the subway, so we can get there.
The butterfly exhibition was enjoyable.
Butterflies sat on their hands and feet.
How's your day?
Oh, my God, I thank you so much, no words, thank you so much.
Mom's staying there four o'clock in the morning.
Perhaps the housekeeper will leave his phone for communication.
I still think this house in Prague-8 is the best way to do it.
Mr. Director didn't tell me anything about the possibility of sponsorship for the baby's lunch.
They gave me this data for payment.
For part of March and April, I paid for food.
If you had an opportunity to help me pay for May and June?
What do I have to do?
Going to Mr. Director of School with this question?
Go on Mondays, or come Wednesday?,, /
All your friends will know you're communicating with me.
I don't know what to do with my home soon and no home.
Did you first get out of your relationships or have you left?
They came from Donetskya. I have medical education, 27 years old, neurological work, massage, liquor physculture for adults and children, lovely medical manipulations.. speaking Russian and Ukrainian... and the rest of the information, call +420-464-548-072 or write to the Wiber +380-42-791-0436.
I was a manicure master, a friend of the manager.
But we know everything, we're Ukraine, and we're not able to learn.)
I want you to find a good helper.
I thought it was Monday.
Can I ask you to take me them, how do you get home?
I need a tumbler, I can pay for the rent.
I didn't know what to do.
We need to go to the embassy periodically, I'm waiting for the documents to be reprocessed, I'm going to ask. I'll be looking here.
I'm also interested in communicating with you.
