I don't think there's anything there.
Express your opinion clearly.
We don't know.
Tom must have forgotten to say that to Mary.

Who told you I did it?
It's never too late.
Leave me alone, I'm sleeping.
Are you not ready for more?
Tom has no idea why Mary lied.

I got an electricity account.
What color is his sweater?
Last week I bought a new car.
I'm sure Tom's gonna be okay.

The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the literary song of the devil.
The problem is she lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary called their child John.
I wonder if Tom would actually go to Mary's concert.
Tom said he spent the last weekend with that?
I used to have the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't notice?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution.
Tom promised me he wouldn't cry.
I'm a dijey.
I hate Christmas.
Was it enough money?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It costs too much.
The baby's lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You need to learn to hold back.
We're fine.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows many.
You're not young.
The same is true for Japan.
We lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Say it.
The surface of the air balloon is an euclide - space, so it is not subject to the rules of euclide’s geometry.
The negotiations were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I've been trying to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
Hope is always there.
I wanted to be Tom.
Tom and Mary will say no.
You're twice as old as me.
The journalist was kidnapped by terrorists.
I dropped the ball.
I hate this town.
Now he lives in Tokyo.
The programming languages are his hobbies.
I'm glad to hear it.
I don't know anything about him.
Tom is a teacher, and I too.
How many clocks do you have in your house?
Tom's deaf.
So it's not good to eat fish.
I don't like any of them.
Follow us.
Tom is very proud of you.
Your doctor says you'll be fine.
You're a panda.
You want to know?
Tom needs to wash his clothes.
I need this money.
My tie is orange.
Is Tom still crying?
So it would have been better.
I have to help my mother.
His book inspired me.
Are you taking it?
These aren't my ideas.
You have a plan, right?
He's out.
Tom's not in town.
My shoes were wearing.
The next year will be worse.
Mary's in a yellow dress.
Love's a bitter taste.
The meeting's over.
You should have done that last year.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I've got an old car.
We understand why.
I'm on my way every year.
I felt helpless.
I like a teacher.
Let's go on the elevator.
Tom's a professional hockeyist.
We went into the woods looking for insects.
These chairs are different.
I saw her a week ago.
Two euros are worth a small coffee chopper.
Mother’s love is greater than anything else.
He persecuted the thief.
I worked in a restaurant.
I'm not strong enough.
It won't be as boring as you think.
He accidentally put salt in his cup of coffee.
Tom forgot to tell you.
I'm interested in music.
I really don't want to eat now.
The glasses of the mirror were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She went through school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is the same as the rest of them.
Tom doesn't think I have to do that.
The government debt is increasing.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom would probably never do that.
That's the doll.
Get out of here!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bicycle?
Speak briefly.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows someone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a good voice.
It's important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the Internet.
You're beautiful.
Tom said he'd complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't dig it.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in thirty minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car.
We can talk.
A computer can count very quickly.
You don't need me.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
What's the weather?
I am thirty years old.
Tom won't bother you anymore.
You want some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change the umbrella.
Do people still use web cameras?
I wondered if Tom had ever asked Mary why she had quit school.
It's a Greek word.
Am I going to die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
The brother is sick.
Don't push.
A car outside.
I was weak.
Please make me a cup of coffee.
Mary lost the money.
No rules.
Leila became pregnant very quickly.
He's not a liar.
Do you know how to make a raw fish salad?
Tom knew what Mary knew.
Tom's cooking breakfast.
There is no doubt that it will rain.
Tom did not mention Australia.
Clearly, Tom of Mary is more than just friends.
We actually went to Boston.
There are many volcanoes in Iceland.
John is two years older than I am.
For the better or for the worse, TV has changed the world.
I'm a bit thick.
He easily answered my question.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom's looking for something.
He must be innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When does she come?
It's not my style.
Try to focus.
I'm very glad I did it yesterday.
Is Tom still living near you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Don't throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a magician.
Don't interrupt me when I say.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you often meet him?
You'd like Tom.
Are you hungry?
We're crazy.
She's got wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was two thousand years old.
Tom would probably do that.
It has to be the right color.
Tom's got a very strict mother.
After short peace, war broke out again.
It's better not to trust Tom.
Just talk to Tom.
Can I remind you of your promise?
The Netherlands Capital — Amsterdam
I don't understand your French.
What's the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you give me sugar?
Where is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where is my laptop?" "On the chair."
I don't think there'll be any problem.
Tom crashed?
You're going to need a shot.
The green is yours.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, boys.
I fix my shirt.
When is his return expected?
I've had a good rest.
He's as good as his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It'd be good if there were 28 hours in the day, right?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would like this catastrophe to happen.
We don't expect to win.
I don't have money.
I'm not here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Go on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a dijey.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with the way I did it?
They're good at fishing.
Tom's out of the room.
I'm still doing this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He got the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swimming.
Tom thanked Mary for her gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My job is very boring.
He's a robot man, as it were.
Answer the question!
You need a hospital.
I can't find the subtract.
That's forgery.
That's not Tom asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don't have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom was never in Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, and Gran Pri was broadcast.
Tom's proud to be a daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered the possibility of amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do so.
English isn't my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's that girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
So we should not do so again.
They live here for ten years.
Tom stared at Mary.
Her neighbor will take care of the children until she's gone.
I'm going to cook.
Did you see Tom's passport?
You want to dance?
It's often late.
Do you remember that summer when Tom shaved his head?
Why did Tom do that?
I know the father of this girl.
This is my third marriage.
Tom can't come with us.
I got 30 points.
If I don't, Tom will be angry.
Aren't you a psychologist?
Don't you write that down?
A large tree fell on the road, and when I was on my way, I was blocked.
I like Tom's company.
Not all the gold that glitters.
I don't have a lot of friends.
Do you believe in the existence of a god?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
I didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Don't you start boring?
What kind of men do you like?
Why Do People Still Smoking?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I'm a student, and he's not.
I tried to do that.
I wrote a book.
Silence, please.
I bought my son new sledges.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister, Sakiko, who was born the same year as I was, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you done your homework?
Monday is probably going to be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help that's why you can paint the fence.
Why do people act like large apes, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
You asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I put the documents on the visa.
It's snowing today.
She kept working.
The rope broke up as we climbed the mountain.
Tom's driving.
If you eat less hamburgers, you'd probably be healthier.
Tom helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary's not coming, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go personally.
Please show me how it's done.
Are you not dating anyone?
All the benches are busy.
I haven't made a decision yet.
What is the date today?
Where's Daddy?
Shut the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
Apple from the apple is far from falling.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Uncle is your father’s brother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was at the jeans.
I'll see you after the show.
I'd like to ask a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Do you ignore me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom doesn't have money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm careful.
Would you mind?
I haven't seen you for all eternity.
You're obviously right.
Whose books?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
See?
Tom plays dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this Tom book.
Japan’s main islands are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honshu, and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't.
Do you think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
You're breaking up.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can match him in the tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you understand that?
She committed suicide.
We've got our office equipped with computers.
We have to pay it early.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Don't you plan to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing the song together.
Tom has three times as much books as I do.
You missed a lot of things.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became the object of criticism.
It'll be genius.
I'm scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under a fly.
You haven't lost time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom witnessed in Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
Can I ask you what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Wouldn't you vote?
You should quit smoking.
I think Tom's betraying.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play violin?
Will you give me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks good French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's miserable.
It was popular for both students and teachers.
No tears will help.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom couldn't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung the phone.
I'll be right back.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did you do that?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do so.
Tom's calling you.
You have to tell him to do that.
He speaks to the esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't care about that.
She's got good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom will come to my party.
Tom told me he didn't like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' practitioner.
I'll handle it.
Did you find any mistakes?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Fuck off.
Is that why you're allowed to shut up?
You're a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Tom actually moved to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wouldn't be here?
Children grow so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Isn't it still cold for you?
The language bearers are subconsciously following the rules of their language, without even being aware of them.
Tom's on vacation.
What if I press this button?
The hunters targeted their guns on the elephant.
No one's boasting.
They tried.
Tom and Mary are still here?
Tom’s wife is a Canadian woman.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary were not able to help me.
I'd like to take the money off.
I shook Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You shouldn't worry about tomorrow's exam.
Tom voted?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do that.
Tom began to bath.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You can't run.
I'm Japanese, but I'm not living in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you get the holidays?
This year, did you get a Christmas gift from Tom?
I still miss my home for a little while, and so many things seem strange to me.
I have some memorizing problems.
Where's Mama?
He fainted three hours after the accident.
Are you speaking Macedonian?
We shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom's with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
You know why?
Check voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom's a little behind the schedule.
Tom's not a hero.
You can catch a cab here?
Come on, you'll be late.
It'll be complicated.
Is Tom always doing that?
I like golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to talk like that.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It's going to work, and you'll see.
She threw it away.
Tom's safe.
I finally got driving licenses.
I'm not a student.
So Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom keeps checking the phone.
How's my wife?
You're right.
Tom's not rich, but Mary's rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone's late, except for me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan to unwash the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of strange ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I'm disappointed by your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Hello.
Please write your name as a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She ignores me completely.
Tom's going to the party tonight.
I told you.
She went to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What is it?
If natural language is like a tree that develops over time, the esperanto can be likened to a plastic tree that was artificially created.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we're going?
Tom doesn't know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you just did your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized I wasn't in love with you.
Did you say 'cause I was kidding?
So it was awfully boring.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Are they suspecting me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Get the garbage out.
Don't you come back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister is as beautiful as always.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed from fear.
Do you like those perfumes?
How horrible!
Are you in a hurry?
I don't have two cats.
If you hire him, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.
It's his obsession.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check it out again.
Tom has a son doctor.
I know it'll be impossible.
Do you have anything from your headache?
Children imitate their friends, not their parents.
Tom's falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
Whatever happens, stay calm.
Tom sent Mary a message.
He's always happy.
When Mary arrived at a bus stop, the last bus had left.
Tom's in the black coat today.
I'll wait by 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually spoke French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they're worthless.
You tried to talk to them?
It was much more difficult than it seemed.
Her friends ridiculed her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom could win.
The aliens come and take away our work, land for the land, deport the Martian!
Don't worry.
Bell invented a phone in 1876.
Are you leaving with the train?
Tom said Mary was good.
He can't go anymore.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, right?
So still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad, and he didn't come back.
Collect your toys together.
It was much more difficult than it seemed.
I think I've had a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you.
I'm getting better.
Are these people crazy?
So it's interesting.
Have you finished your job?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's easy to do.
Tom's dead.
I like being alone.
We were both drunk.
I am not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
The box was too heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said he wouldn't think Mary would.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.
He worked hard to achieve his goal.
Ken has two cats.
I realized what my mistake was.
I love the trips.
The phone doesn't work.
That's what we want.
Tom's in sunscreens.
Tom's drawing good.
All you have to do is click on the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I get a plastic suit for Halloween?
Tom's busy and can't help you now.
We're not a couple.
A student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting hot.
Why don't you sleep?
Tom really thinks someone's listening?
You don't have to give up!
Tom, you could say, good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I had to go before.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's got a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Understand?
Tom wasn't rough with me.
How do you say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.
Tom’s wife asked him to quit his job.
Can't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You're such an unbearable man.
What's going on here?
Tom said you were speaking French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's free.
I am very interested in studying French.
Take a good cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could lend to you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're pleased with your job.
Are you working around here?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm ungrateful.
You're always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but I grew up in Tokyo.
You're very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom is talking about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom's okay.
I don't sleep well.
Wouldn't you buy that?
Women are good.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did it?
Did you do that?
I'm in trouble with my nighttime sleep.
Tom sometimes irritates me.
I dance pretty well.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obvious that you're going to have to spend more money with us.
He's not watching TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom is a rare bastard.
His hair became thin and thin.
My sister went to Kobe yesterday.
Don't you speak in terms of experience?
He likes ice cream.
I was hungry.
What do you need to know?
She has twice as many CDs as I have.
The street is empty again.
Tom couldn't catch a rabbit.
All dogs are faithful.
I think Tom hates me.
We're so happy.
Tom and Mary are both very upset.
Wouldn't you stay with us?
It's communism.
In this place the river suddenly narrows down.
Jesus is a parasite.
I don't often do it.
Tom is a very practical person.
I have a good motherfucker.
I need a political shelter.
It was quiet after the storm.
There is no simple way to succeed.
Here's the train.
He loves tiger.
It's raining, so we can't do it.
It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your name?
Tom and Mary are planning to retire when they're sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your sufferings make me happy.
When did you do anything for me?
We locked the door.
There he is!
We're different.
Tom and Mary know?
Are you all right?
Don't sleep with the light.
He's not stupider than you.
The ride in Serbia is terriblely slow.
I think Tom is vicious.
"Coni" is a set of "end."
Where's the ashtray?
Can you explain what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell him the truth.
He didn't dare say no to my plan.
Tom told the tired neighbor to take his life and stop singing his nose to the cause of others.
It was part of the plan.
Many stars were seen in heaven.
Apple from the apple is far from falling.
We're waiting for them to go.
Tom changed his face.
I'll do whatever you want from me.
I used to live with Tom.
Speak louder, please.
You can sit where you want.
I think Humi's sick.
The price represents demand.

I ask myself if that's why I can trust.
What's wrong with her?
Are you drinking?
I was angry.
When did he arrive?
Where's your chicken bear?
How you doing, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win the Eurovision.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm careful.
Do you have a passport?
I could have forgotten my wallet.
Cats catch mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing this for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I forced Tom to do it.
Why would Tom want to do that?
The birds can see the earth’s magnetic field by means of their eyes.
Do you need a car?
It's Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
Don't come in, I'm naked.
Are you planning on doing this somehow?
Do I express myself clearly?
I'm free tonight.
Tom may have been punished for doing so.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to hurry.
Are you happy?
I didn't believe him at first.
The phone doesn't work at this time.
Tom and his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Come in, please!
Come inside.
Tom may be fined if he does.
I know you're not an idiot.
I'm the strongest.
It's really foolish.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom said Mary he saw John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She's always contradicting herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog walks after me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that in your place.
Tom's already in French.
The earth went from father to son.
No roses without spikes.
I hope they're not.
Don't drink too much, huh?
Wait for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like watching TV.
He abandoned the family.
Let's go?
You don't have to contact Tom.
I'm shaved.
I'm the boss.
Tom had a good job.
You have to go home by 9:00.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did.
Tom can't drive.
Tom spent this day with his daughter.
Every student has his own party.
We were ready.
I'm worried about what I can get to court.
My family lives here.
Tom's listening.
It came out of my hands.
Tom speaks well French.
I know I'll learn a lot.
I went on Monday to catch fish.
Mary loved her dog.
It's over.
The Unicycle has one wheel.
"Dad, look there, shark!" "It's a whale, Tom."
I know you're hiding something.
People always say that I'm very friendly.
I'm a botan.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Tom.
The congregations were quite good.
At this time of the year, the wind is blowing from the ocean.
I saw Tom smiled.
Come on, let's go!
I'm sure he's an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned that.
Go and beat this bullshit.
This is our car.
Hi, I'm Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I am ashamed that I did.
Should I go to the hospital?
In her free time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom's singing "cantre" music better than anyone else I know.
He drinks moderate amounts of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care how she's dressed.
Did you see his new movie?
I'm good at it.
Why was he released?
Tom said Mary's gone.
I don't have enough money to buy it.
Mary said she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased idea is that it's a horrible movie.
You're very elegant.
Whatever you want.
I could change.
It's significant.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
Tom's got her.
Tom was a boss.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we didn't.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You have to help her.
You're not going to pay for the cry of calamity.
He did his homework on his own.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed his lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Come on, I'll talk to Tom.
Tom's not very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do that?
I hope you come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love can't be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you had to say something.
I'm ready to work.
What is this theater?
Did you see the protein?
Mary told her that Tom had told her.
Tom was not a very good witness.
I visited my grandmother.
I hate the wedding.
I heard the front door rattling.
I can't follow you.
Marika's dancing great.
My grandfather's from Osaka.
I want a massage, I need to relax.
Tom's so lucky.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Were you able to sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did that.
What do you think when Tom will be here?
Is snow coming tonight?
Does that play you?
Are you dating someone here?
I live in Milan.
When did she do anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of two is an irrational number.
He's small.
Did you not know that this would happen?
Bad thoughts produce bad actions.
You brought the fen?
Tom's not wrong.
Do you have a loan from this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't do it without water.
I can't get together with my thoughts.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in a village.
I'd never give up.
I speak French freely.
Tom didn't waste his time.
Push me.
You're disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He was very drunk.
Tom claims he's pleased.
How are you feeling now?
How many guys are in your class?
These are big apples.
Make a diligent choice.
I'm coming with her.
Why do you do that?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
Lack of news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us time.
Don't interrupt our conversation.
You're obviously sick.
You were in London three times.
I'll be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I'm going slowly.
After the film, they fell asleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom's gone from Boston.
I threw my bones.
The book lacked a few pages.
I picked up a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks his promises.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sarah don't get along very well.
Every student has his own party.
I spent 12 hours in the train.
I'll regret it.
I'm not sure Tom's telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Don't go.
Tom doesn't have thirst.
I learned to catch a cow.
I'm fat.
I'm sorry I'm not rich.
The news made her very sad.
I've got a lot of time.
Happy New Year!
You'll see it yourself.
I've never killed anyone.
How is your name pronunciated?
She keeps flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him before?
We're used to it.
The old man's in ninety years.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where did you get that?
Are we done?
Are you from Boston?
Have you known her since 1990?
You're good at doing that, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom's special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She's got red blood.
What happened?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way of rest.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom did nothing of what we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know what Tom told us was a lie.
Tom heard that Mary had married.
I learned a lot.
How much does this umbrella cost?
They both laughed.
What happened?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary's exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class was infected with flu.
Remember when you first heard Beatles?
Was Tom hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
No toilet paper.
The word is silver, the silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually more busy than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom may still be angry.
I'll go to the airport.
Never mind her whims.
I'm glad Tom's gonna help us.
Tom will be here in a minute.
I'm glad they're both in our team.
Where can we sit?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always have my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you okay?
I'm a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see you again.
He didn't know anything.
I invited her to see you.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks frightened.
When did you come to China?
Do you approve what Tom's doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
Nice to meet you, Tom.
It's a perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary she had to do it.
I don't expect them to win.
I'm asleep.
How is this my fault?
About Switzerland, have you been travelling in the winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It's getting better.
I'm studying Vietnamese.
I'll meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay the loan debt.
Try to look at this from the point of view of Tom.
The window is open.
Nobody thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You'll be happy.
Tom was quite sick when I last saw him.
Tom's still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do this with you.
Mary watched a romantic comic book.
Grab him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom's such an asshole.
Would you like another potato turre?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a moustache.
I have three questions to ask you.
I've met Tom several times.
Do you use a text processor?
Tom and Mary do many things together.
Please move on.
What are you doing this evening?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French freely, don't you?
As you like.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home.
I greeted Tom.
Tom took off his back ring.
I'll give you breakfast.
Tom was listening.
Who crashed it out?
Your ideas are somewhat outdated.
