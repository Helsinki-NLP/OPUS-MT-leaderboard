The FANO of Russia will hold a final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) will hold with RAN a third expert session entitled “Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations”.
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, reported in the press release issued by the Lenta.Ru.
The third meeting is scheduled to take stock of the work of the Expert Session for a year and to form a final list of indicators for assessing the impact of scientific organizations.
Individual participants plan to discuss the rules for the establishment of expert groups responsible for the evaluation of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in the course of events to create a unified approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the impact of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in doing so, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
Following the next session, we must conclude the development of scientific and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and dates of the evaluation,” said the Chief of the FANO Russian expert analysis office, Helena Axenov.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will participate in the event.
It is expected that the resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. by Moscow Time on 16 September 2014: Moscow City, Solank Street, House 14.
Scientists Found a Way to Find Related Stars
Astrophysics at the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied the turbulence and its impact on chemical uniformity in star strips.
It is expected that the discovery of professionals will allow the search for relative stars, that is, those that emerge from one cluster.
The authors published their studies in the Nature magazine and are briefly available on the university website.
The same chemical composition of nearby stars is caused by turbulent mixing in gas clouds preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the star that is born then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can identify its birth place and the fertile star region.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The modelling results of astrophysics show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, supercomputer modelled two interstellar gas flows that formed clouds together.
This object has been converted into a cluster for several million years under its own gravity, which begins to form a gateway.
Scientists added paint marks to the initial gas flows and found that rapid turbulence in the cloud has reached a high level of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysics believe that their study proves that chemical-producing stars can be found and that possible regions of the establishment of such facilities can be identified.
Carrata Police arrested 20 years after the high-speed motorcycle persecution
The motorcycle was confiscated after travelling at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed zone and through the Bushland to escape from the Pilbar police.
Carrat's transport police patrol tried to stop the blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed was 125 km/h when he left the service station at Batgate Road.
The police reported that the motorcycler had not stopped and continued the movement on Berjes Rood, then turned him down to the Bushland, leaving the police out of sight.
A motorcycle and a driver’s description were noticed near the house in Walcott Way in Bulgar.
The Carrata Police charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He must be brought before the Carrata World Court on 23 September.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not "burst the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from WTO
Russia will not "burst the door" in connection with new sanctions.
This has been stated today by Head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of IGMO.
With regard to our responses to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasy, because everything should be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what European and American partners will like for this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be linked to the striking of doors, some insults, falsely understood, the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, be distracted from our interests, our interests to protect our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of the partners for their adequacy, treaty capacity and reliability.
On what steps are being taken in the area of sanctions, it is well understood what partners are doing, - continued by the head of the MID RF.
If the whole voice says that "these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we have to go to punish Russia," it's probably not very adequate."
With regard to the WTO's withdrawal of the RF in response to possible new sanctions, it is not.
On the contrary, we want to learn more about the WTO instruments, including when trade disputes are under way, said Lavrov.
We have already used this instrument to overcome, we believe, the discriminatory EU policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the Minister, Russia is accused of demping and is being used against the economy of the RF anti-dumping measures.
“We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the EU third energy package retrospectively”, said Lavrov.
How can you use the cheese properly in the garden design?
Irina Okunev answers:
Since the cheese loses its basic attractiveness, it is desirable to plant with other shrubs.
It is beautifully combined with many cultures.
In addition, plants that are decorative and blossoming at the same time can and must be planted alongside the cheese.
Another plus raw is that it provides a lot of creative opportunities.
You can form it with a strain tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with broad foundations, and even a kind of garden bonsai, a tree with an awesome trunk.
Just select the form that's more in line with your garden design.
In Karelia, the resident of the Leningrad region was convicted for the sale of false money
As reported in the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, a man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonetsk and Segez districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already inherited the Voloslav region, where he was sentenced to two and a half years in the spring of this year.
Later, the man was brought before the Olontek District Court.
And to complete the investigation of the crimes committed in our Republic, it was staged in Segeju.
In the investigation, it was proved to be guilty of a number of counterfeit money episodes relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June of this year, criminal proceedings with indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment with four years in the general regime.
The verdict did not enter into legal force.
Remember, in the past week, two more counterfeiters were convicted of paying their money in Petrozawadusk stores.
Azerbaijani citizens also arrived in Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them has been deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four years.
Every person has a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The verdict has also not yet entered into legal force.
In Arhangelsk, we celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the first convoy Derves.
The meeting held at the district centre was devoted to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervesh delivered military aid to the USSR from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arhangelsk, a monument of the northern convoys, located on the coastal name of Cedov, in Solubal, took place at the stone of the future.
The event was attended by representatives of the veteran organizations of Arhanguelsk, children of the Cadet class.
For the first time, we met twenty-three years ago, when we were laid with a cotton stone.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who have not returned the sea," said the president of the Council of the North Sea Veterans of Boris Carpov.
The event was followed by a city spirit orchestra, and the cadette classrooms gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the Russian flags and the sign of the Victory.
The rally ended with the planting of flowers.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport loaded with strategic raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of formed boots, tin, wool and many other inventory and equipment).
In addition, military equipment and armaments were also on board - 3,800 deep bombs and magnetic mines, 15 Kharrickane fighters in dismantled condition.
At the same time, the convoy was 16 British WMF ships, including two airborne carriers.
The caravan of the ships was not discovered by an opponent and successfully reached the destination of Arhanhelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravans, 126 ships and about 50 military vessels were killed.

The following year, participants are planning to stand at the Russian level, reports a press service to the urban administration.
Reminding the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
The Congressmen Kit Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill for which the organization of trade unions is protected as a civil right.
"Where trade unions are there and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, co-chairing the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
That is why I am proud to introduce the Workers' Empowerment Act, together with the symbol of the Civil Rights Movement, John Lewis.
This innovative bill will provide workers with the same legal opportunities in discriminated against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the opponents of trade unions.
The amendment of the Labour Regulatory Act to allow workers facing discrimination for trade union participation to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative, at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and sponsors of the bill is to recall a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that trade unions have suffered in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have once supported countries around the world to accept, expand and respect labour rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remembered when the country simultaneously protected democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas McArthur and his associates helped the country to adopt a constitution designed to guarantee that the Hideki Todho military automaton was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions are playing a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize and to negotiations and to collective action is guaranteed”.
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
Acknowledging that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and to every profession or occupation.
Agreements which restrict or seek to infringe this right would not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes would be declared illegal.
When the former Lady Eleonor Roosevelt was President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which had drafted the World Declaration on Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and its members had included the guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions in order to protect his interests”.
The U.S. generations have adopted as a proper basic provision that labour rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions - and that the trade union should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government agencies.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to revert to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and to hear their voices in a free and open society.
Like Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation but has increased them.
By raising the living standards of millions, trade unions miraculously created the market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the enhancement of the protection of civil rights - to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions is long overdue.
Kit Allison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocks the law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the federal judge temporarily blocked the implementation of the Law of Louisiana, of which his supporters say that he would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
According to this measure, which was signed by Governor Louisiana Bobby Jinadl in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, doctors who make abortions would be obliged to have the authority to receive patients at the hospital in a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge ' s decision means that, to date, doctors can continue to make legal abortions by continuing to seek such authority.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to obtain authority”, wrote Judge John de Grewells in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within the month at which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion were happy to meet this decision, the last in the draft of decisions against similar measures, saying that this would give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.
“The present decision guarantees that the women of Louisiana will be protected from a fraudulent law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Nortape, president and head of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, who filed a claim for a stay of the law from the person of three of the five state clinics.
It was not clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics who had not filed the plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admission.
Louisiana is in 11 states that have enacted such laws, and the courts have recently found such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and the Mission.
The key parts of the Texas Law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in that state, were blocked by the Federal Judge on Friday.
Bordies for the right to abortion, together with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on the powers of admission impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary in terms of medicine.
Abnormal opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing the clinic.
Only one doctor who performs abortion in Louisiana has the authority to receive hospitals has reported to the Centre for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop this procedure, the doctor, fearful of his safety, would have ceased to carry out the procedure, reported the team.
Criticizing this decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish abortion doctors until their application for decision-making power was pending.
Towards the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the trade networks should be Russian production, considers Oleg Neil's deputy from the “Russian Justice” faction.
The Parliamentary Office has drafted a bill aimed at introducing protection measures against domestic producers, reports the newspaper “Envestment”.
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This relates to goods that are not produced in Russia. " ...> For the rest of the products produced in Russia, the Riyler will have to provide at least half of his shelves to the domestic producers,” reported Neil to the publication.
In addition to the amendments to the article “On the basis of public regulation of trade activities in the RF”, the Bill provides for an amendment to the Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent low rate of VAT in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50 per cent quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentives for Russian producers.
There will be more and more domestic goods on the trolleys.
However, the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, the experts said.
According to the counsel of Nalogovick, a member of the independent expert centre of Public Think, Sergei Litwinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive and will result in growth.
There will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They can sell more, which means they're going to grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, since they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers would be able to increase their activities and sales, which would result in higher taxes than before.
This will increase the revenues of the budget, create new jobs, some industries will start expanding, somewhat faster learning, and contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decline several times, but not at once," notes the expert.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to catch local shops because of high competition by foreign analogies.
Now, after the embargo, this niche has been released and can be sighed with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that, following all necessary harmonization and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will be delivered to the Russian market.
In other words, it's "the moment of silence," when the former players are gone and the new ones are not yet here.
Almost a month later, there is an increased demand for domestic raw materials as well as an increase in the prices of finished products,” said Aif.ru, the first Vice-President of the Russian Public Organization of the Russian Club of Financial Directors, by Tamara Cassianova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50 per cent of Russian food products in each category would enable the sector to be secured by local producers.
In such a case, they will compete with each other rather than with goods that are cheaper from subsidies to another State.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will be developed between companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kassianova notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the domestic needs of the constituent.
In this situation, trade networks will have to “take” the proportion of Russian goods to half of the assortimant.
As a result, there is growing fear that poor goods will be brought to the trunk.
Perhaps foreign products with overlapping labels will be produced in Russia”, adds the expert.
The negative impact of quotas is felt by large trading networks, especially those that benefit from cooperation with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers themselves will suffer from such a pattern, as demand for their products will decrease.
Lithuanianenko does not preclude that the domestic product quotas law may affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian products may be subject to the quality of import analogies, while shops can accuse prices for the second product as a deficit.
The idea of importation in the early 2000s was reconsidered by economists in February this year owing to the continued deвальvation of the ruble.
Now, in contrast to the difficult relationship with the West, the issue of refusal of imports is becoming even more relevant.
The law obliges rhetors to be treated with domestic producers when ordering suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way to importation, and the production planning system for the required products will be established in a shorter time,” says Oleg Neil.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to cover the entire collection of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can receive a powerful impulse.
The largest share of imports is known to beef, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It turns out that 65 to 70 per cent are still Russian products," reasoning Cassianov.
Experts are of the view that the introduction of domestic product quotas will facilitate importation and may accelerate the process.
However, importation will not in itself lead to this initiative, since it requires a set of measures assured by Lithuanianenko.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold under this initiative could still be brought from abroad, thus not fully imported, but significant steps would be taken in that regard.
In addition, quotas should not be set, domestic products must still be manufactured in the country to implement these quotas.
The quotas are the guarantees and will provide,” the expert notes.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Andrzelin Jolie and her brother James published a video of their late mother's memory that died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers have analysed the maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed as “the ovary rac” in 2005, finding that only 35 per cent had lived five years after the diagnosis had been diagnosed.
The lead researcher Susan Jordan of the Institute for Medical Research of QIMR Berghofer reported that the likelihood of death during the study was 20 per cent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
MOST MEASURES: New drugs can slow down lung cancer and ovarian cancer
Researchers have traced women's medical path in seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, current diseases and social economic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those with cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 per cent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynaecological cancer, and they are mostly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distances, she suggested that an increase in the number of services on exit that would enable professionals to treat women closer to their homes and programmes of support for people who had been treated far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, irrespective of geography, the study found that long life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective strategies for treatment and prevention.
A study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer will be published today in Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Golden Coast, Elisha Nev, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP door will be opened in the Kozhener district.
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibelak began in April this year and was carried out by a model project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million roubles.
According to the Public Liaison and Information Office of the Head of Mariy El, funding for the construction of the site was financed by the Republic ' s budget in accordance with the targeted investment programme.
The total area of the facility built is nearly 230 square metres.
The villages of Toktaibelak and the villages of Dementievo, Püncherümal, Tunja, Fomici, Toraybelak, Shinura and Chachal will be provided with medical assistance.
The new paradigm will replace the existing FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises are not in accordance with hygiene requirements.
The new institution will be opened shortly.
Killing a four-month-old son in an improper state will be brought before a court
The Chuvashii woman will be on the bench of the defendants for killing her own child.
In Cheboksars, the investigation of the criminal case against the 31-year-old resident of Novochebosarsk accused of causing death on grounds of unwaryness.
The investigation found that on 26 July this year the accused and her four-month son had come to celebrate the birth of the child in Cheboksara.
After a long residue, the newlywoman decided to stay in the hospital and put the child to bed.
When the baby woke up at night and wept, the negligent woman put it next to her bed to feed her breast, but soon she fell asleep.
During her sleep, a woman attacked her son, causing him to die of suffocation.
A criminal case, a press service reported by the UCR on Chuwashiya, has been sent to the court.
Inflation's out of leave.
Do Russians Feel the Rising Growth of Price
As a result of cross-sanctions by the RF and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not be set in the predictions of the authorities, the WTB Capital analysts are convinced.
In the view of the experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will result in inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes the RBC Daily.
According to the latest projection of Min Economy, in 2014 inflation would be 6.5 to 7.5 per cent, and in the next year it would be less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the Commersant’s newspaper, this week the MER should make “little but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic projection by 2017.
According to the publication, the department can reduce the estimates of inflation for 2015, thereby eliminating the expected depreciation of population income.
It was projected that the food sanctions of the RFs were in force for the year until August 2015.
How could such inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward inflation trend will not change”, stated the Munfin newspaper source.
VTB capital economists do not share the Government ' s financial and economic budget for inflation and project price increases of 8 per cent in 2014.
Experts are convinced of the main effects of the food bans, along with the possible incorporation of sales tax in the RCF regions (GDP) in 2015.
Inflationary peaks of 9 per cent will have to take place on February, followed by annual price increases by experts.
By the way, last week Rostat had the first inflationary results after the RF had imposed “acquaintance sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and clarified their inflationary expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of the FC AForex:
Prices are already increasing in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially important products were valued, the Government had to launch systemic price stability monitoring measures to prevent unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and rhetors are already accountable on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason, the price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the enormous rate of capital flows, the excessive refinance of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, the internal conversion due to the foreign currency fleet, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have acceded to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the value of the minimum package would not have jumped by 12 per cent per quarter.
The ban on the import of food has led to a shock of supply in the domestic market and a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since we are not able to fully implement the importation mechanism at the current stage, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the sanctions will continue to be at risk of inflationary growth.
If the fiscal reasons for lack of confidence in national currencies as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth are added here, inflation may well exceed 8 per cent by the end of this year.
Alexander Roswaev, Director of the Alpari Analysis Department
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30 per cent per month, and in zero levels, it was also higher than the current level, and another case, which was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think the end of the year is 8-8.5% inflation.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of the UK Foundation of Maguta
The external sanction factor against Russia is still successfully deterred, but if there is a further increase in pressure on the financial sector, it can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population that are traditionally shown in cash purchases to save their savings.
It may be assumed that the Government, the CBC and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth deterioration of the timber, both by market and by public regulation.
But price increases are traditionally beginning after a year's silence, and perhaps this autumn will become more tangible.
The consumption inflation target in Russia is likely to be 7.5 per cent, as the RF is still owned by financial savings.
Agricultural centres are appalled by the decline in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, due to an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age, may lead to the loss of tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach “the basic age of gardening”, according to a study by HTA reported in Financial Times.
According to this report, housing-free people spend an average of 55 per cent of the amount that household owners spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in high-carbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of parking yards and the reduction of garden size as other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated at 5 billion dollars per year.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lowest in Britain is the cost of household gardeners.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society reported that rental of housing and lack of garden space did not mean that humans could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden adviser in RHS, said: “Growing plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can transport plants with themselves when they move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the “Golden Age” of retail trade for gardening as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will be improved this year by a better weather after the unfavourable conditions of March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out mass cleansing in the Landholding Fund
Three of the four landowners were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four land managers were replaced on Friday.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture officially reported only the removal of the post of Executive Director Athanas Goodwah.
Losena Vasiliv took his place.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three Deputy Executive Directors of the Fund were quietly changed.
The Deputy Executive Director, Tatiana Angelova, who had been in charge of government assistance and the SAPARD programme until now, reports BGNES with reference to the newspaper Trude.
I wasn't present at the Board of Governors of the Foundation, because we were not members of the leadership by law, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal is not reported on the fund website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope I'll learn more on Monday," said Angel's publication.
It will be occupied by Ivanca Bagdatov, who was still the Chief of Investment Credit in the Central Fund in Sofia.
A Deputy Executive Director, Nikolai Dachev, was also released.
Until then, it was responsible for direct subsidies for EU-payable fields.
It will be assigned to the city of Great Tyrnov, which was head of the Groundland Region Direction in the city of Great Thirnov until January 2014.
Only the Deputy Chief of the Fund, Atige Aliyev-Vel, retained his post.
It is now responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls for a United States diplomat in connection with the report on the spying
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Turkey called the highest American diplomat in the country to explain the report on the American and British spying in Turkey.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Bulent, reported that the American person and Turkish officials discussed the communication on Monday.
The German magazine Deer Spiegel and the Internet Journal Intercept reported that the documents provided by the former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowen showed that Turkey was a priority exploration site for American and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, President Rejep Tayip Erdogan of Turkey has reduced the importance of the communication by saying that all leading countries are spies.
Previously reported that the German main intelligence agency had also made Ankaru the object of exploration, a more angry response from the Turkish Government.
Major Chinese companies combined against Alibaba
China ' s companies, among them the largest business business deviler Dalian Wanda Group and the Tencent Holdings Internet Guigantee (society, messenger et al.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engineer), are creating a company that will compete in the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, it will not be easy to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet that left behind even its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com.
Union of the Greatest
The company plans to invest in a joint venture of 5 billion Yuan ($814 million), 70 per cent will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent to each Internet company, says Wanda Group.
The firm is planned to register in Hong Kong.
The SP will combine the Baidu search services with the popular WeChat social platform (the largest social society in China, whose number is about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 hotels, the Wanda group manages at least 49 commercial property sites throughout China and 40 trade centres.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion Yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and thematic park of entertainment in Cindao, East China, on the shore of the Yellow Sea.
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors each year and produce profits at $960 million.
Wanda also owns the American network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to establish all its trade centres, hotels and places of entertainment by e-commerce services, the development of which will be undertaken as a competitive Alibaba.
According to the Dan Tze, who will lead the new company, Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce from the current 40 million people to 100 million by the next year.
The new site should be the world's largest online to-offline platform, notes Dan Tze.
The Internet to-offline (O2O) of commerce is to attract customers on the Internet to enter normal offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is sale of coupons like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the largest pie in online commerce," said Wanda Wang Jianjin, leader of Bloomberg.
“The present O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation, the chances are approximately equal for all,” he considers.
The Chinese Internet trade market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co estimates that it will increase more than three times by 2015 than in 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has increased to 632 million, and Bloomberg provides official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And it is projected that by 2015, that number could rise to 850 million.
Union of the Richest
The head of Tencent Ma Huaten had been the richest person of China until recently, but according to the Bloomberg Millionaire Index, founder Alibaba Jack Ma had already championed him by $5.5 billion.
The state of Jack Ma is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which 11 billion are accounted for in Alibaba.
Baidu Robin Li's leader is now the third one among the richest people in China, while Van Jianlein of Wanda is the fourth line of rating.
"In this battle, it's very interesting to observe that three of the richest men unite their efforts to challenge even more rich," said Bloomberg, the director of the Chinese E-Commerce Research Centre in Hanzhou Zao Lay.
But he believes that the new company will not be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after the creation, "Rim cannot be built in one day."
The fact that Alibaba is not simply competing not only with new companies but also with the well-deserved world Internet trade leaders testifies to the previous report on Alibaba's financial performance in the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as an average between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors together.
The net profits of Alibaba for the period are almost twice as high as the same amount of competitors - it has grown almost three times annually to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has an enormous potential for generating money, largely thanks to its mobile applications”, commented on the Bloomberg report by an analyst at the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated Alibaba site of the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission, the number of active mobile service users of the company in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8 per cent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to identify the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to the average estimate of 11 Bloomberg analysts, the company can be estimated at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, the Alibaba debut at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may be held on 16 September.
The roadshow company that precedes this event will start on September 3.
It is expected that Alibaba's exit to the IPO will be a record in the history of NYSE and will allow the company to attract about $20 billion.
To date, the record of the United States exchanges was the Visa payroll system, which made its shares the primary placement in 2008, earning $17.9 billion of it.
At least half of the foodstuffs in trade networks should be Russian production, considered by the Deputies of the Lords.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
It is about amending article 8 of the FZ “On the basis of public regulation of trade activities in the RF” and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures for Russian food producers.
An important clarification under the Bill is that at least 50 per cent of domestic products in shops should be available for each product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be made a “food” to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code, which sets a 10 per cent low rate of VAT for all food products whose country of origin is Russia, reports the newspaper “Envestia”.
On 27 August, a draft law amending the Retail Markets Act was introduced to the lower House of Parliament, which proposes to regenerate in Russia the farm markets where small producers can implement their products.
The Chief of Police of Magalut is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs provided evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia into the office of Malorki State Prosecutor on Friday.
The Chief of Police of Calvia on the Kuorth Island of Malorca was arrested as a result of charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at a scandalously known centre of unsuccessful drunkenness of Magalufe.
The Chief Inspector, José Antonio Navarro, was detained as a result of allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballen, a street on which most of the bars and night clubs of Magalut are located.
According to a daily Mallorca Diario online publication, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the Attorney of Malorca on anti-corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the guards of the Spanish National Guard for charges of corruption and will be interrogated by the judge with Navarro.
ABC, a Spanish daily publication, reported that dissatisfied nightclub owners said that protectionism by the authorities was seriously affecting their business status.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving," said one of the businessmen to the court.
We cannot endanger our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magalut was in the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular video on YouTube showing an 18-year-old British resting, which took the past 24 men during the raid on bars.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop the bullying in an improper state among the resters of Magalut, minimizing the number of scandalized alcohol attacks on bars.
In addition, the Playhouse Club, where the minetry incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and Carnage bar fugitives were combined with €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mostly popular among young British resters, was also a place of numerous accidents in alcoholic drunkenness associated with the crazy fun known as “Balconing” when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and wind conditions affecting flights to the Airport of Adelaide
WEETH prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing rainfall and strong winds that affected airport Adelaide.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city by 9: 00 p.m., followed 6.6 mm during the Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a burst wind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before eight o’clock and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After the winter gave the early spring part last week, the temperature fell again on Monday to the maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The feasible conditions are expected to serve as one of the reasons for the delay in landing of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane had to land immediately after 7:30 p.m. but had to be moved into the wind zone, a sudden change in speed or direction at a short distance, and had to take a height.
Wind breaks reached 50 km/h on earth in Adelaide Airport at that time.
Flight data showed that the aircraft had to climb altitude during the second landing, and the aircraft finally landed around 8:40 a.m.
This flight delayed several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
Max 16C is projected in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two rains.
Calculation of the estimates of construction facilities in the RF will be done in a new manner
Pricing, construction management and networking issues are monitored by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The FAS has established an expert board for the development of competition in the construction field.
At its meeting, the head of the control of the FAS Vadim Solovev, the FAC, and the natural resource management, stated that “now the calculation of the construction facilities is totally unclear”.
The normative framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unsubstantiated construction prices, is considered in the FAS.
The cost of building public facilities at the design stage is proposed to determine positive solutions based on market prices instead of the current estimates and the single cost of technological operations.
These proposals are included in the “road map” and are currently under consideration in the mines.
“The replacement of traditional estimates in construction for designs of design elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Solviv “RGB”.
Because it's now counting every bolt and gay, and it's not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation, non-voluntary construction companies can bury whole tractors.
In the mine with the FAS, we agree.
“First work on the value-of-living process for constructive elements already exists: methods have been developed to calculate the price of constructive solutions and estimates for these indicators,” explained the “RGB” to the Chief of the Department of Urban Development and the architecture of the minestre of Helena Jukova.
As a pilot, road construction is selected.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to WGB, the head of the Construction Company Profi Invest Anatoly Demiyanko, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
“As regards proposed design calculations, this is difficult in practice, as buildings often use completely different technologies,” he considers.
It's not a secret that the building develops in a large way because of the government order.
According to the President of the NP, the “Expert Community of Professionals of State Order”, Catherine Lezina, today the State is the most able to pay.
The Supervisor for Engineering of the Rosatom Capital Centre, Vladimir Malakhov, pointed out that the market today is subdivided by companies with access to the portfolio and by companies owning monopolitan competencies and not allowing competitors to do so.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is as secured as possible from any controlling influence.
The expert board was invited to establish a public order system in such a way that the same perpetrator was not entitled to obtain more than one rouble contract or more than 1 billion contracts.
Minstros believe that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As explained by Elena Jukova, in this case, the contractor ' s functions would have to be assigned to the contractor ' s functions, which would result in an increase in the level of the contractor ' s staffing and budget costs for its maintenance.
In doing so, customers will have knowledge to assess the quality of and security of the work done by contracting organizations.
In many cases, it will be necessary to identify who will be responsible for the safety of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach could result in the outflow of high-skilled participants in public procurement owing to the lack of interest in obtaining a State order for part-time work and a small amount of contract.
Alexander Evstaschenkok, the expert consulting centre of the Procurement Institute, believes that the state of affairs process has now become a business game for the contractor's attention.
The example was that “a participant, when completing the application, must specify “concluding indicators” without the words “or equivalent”, “equivalence”, “one”, “one”, “one”, “one”, “analog”, “or”, “analogical”, “not lower”, “not lower”, “higher”, “might”, “may”, “may be”, “before”, “not earlier”, “not above”, “not allowed”, etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting organizations.
Another 44-FZ problem, according to Eustaschenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the participant ' s paper proposal during the application stage.
In reviewing the application of the participant, only the qualifications of the contractor can be measured, but not the quality of the work that has not even begun, the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The Expert Board was also invited to transfer marginal income from the top to the bottom of the floor so that intermediate contractors could disappear.
The President of the Expert Council, the Stats Secretary, the Deputy FAS Manager, Andrey Krarikovski, believes that this is not worthwhile, since the gene contractor has to be responsible for the commission.
And otherwise, it's going to be like Arcade Rykin's famous reprize "Atelle," "There's a claim to the triggers?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza Strip
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories close to the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after they spent the summer in shelters, when rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed when the Territory recovered after hostilities.
The start of school sessions brought joy and frustration to the settlements of southern Israel affected by missiles, but the patterns of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, Pashosh children's garden, where a rocket came into, removed traces of shells from walls and child mountains before the pupils arrived.
"We're a little afraid, but we're happy to see the future," said Ronit Bart, a Kibuzz Saad resident, and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a sizeable life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shaney Bart, said that suddenly she started going to school "just strange."
"It was a hard time and we didn't get out of our houses at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibuzz, situated near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before the ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements, such as Saad, did not walk outside or left their homes, leaving safer areas away from the Gaza Strip to escape a missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border, where a four-year-old boy was killed by the sculpture of the Palestinian mine, doubted that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families still had not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city at the border with Gaza, which had worked hard for the Palestinian fire.
He said, “We will do all we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as the Hamas requirement for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel desires Hamas to lay down arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
The new stage of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, of whom three quarters were peaceful citizens and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of the people killed were militants; despite this, it did not provide substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai employee.
During the hostilities of Hamas and other Gaza fighters, 4,551 missiles and mines were fired on Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
In the meantime, the Israeli army carried out over 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and it is estimated that 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been transformed into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still living in shelters and fighting continued, education officials postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open to us to complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amar, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a Gaza school.
According to the popular real estate price criterion, the largest winter growth in seven years has been shown.
The housing index RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for housing prices in the Australian capital increased by 1.1 per cent in August and reported data to RP on Monday.
This increase has resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 per cent, more than twice as high as 12 months by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed to the country.
The Director of RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sydney and Melbourne run a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney the housing price has increased by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while in Melbourne it is 11.7 per cent.
The following markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where the average prices rose from five to six per cent.
The other end of the scale was Canberra, where government cost reductions were received, with prices rising only 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Loules said that now, when spring begins, there will be an increase in the number of real estate items placed on sale over a few months later, which will be a "real test" for the market.
“In view of the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high speed of sales and the current conditions at low interest rates, it is likely that the cost of housing will increase in the next three months,” he said.
How People Live in the Oldest House of Upha
In the former home of the gold industry and the Evdokima mining plants and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazanka) 18 apartments.
The 18th - century home of the building has remained virtually unchanged unless it is considered old.
Foreigners go to the tour, and residents suffer more than they rejoice over their privilege of living in an oldest Uphimian home, whose walls are remembered by general Alexander Suvorova.
The date of construction is inaccurate, historians point to two dates, 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out that the building is 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open doors, squeaking staircases.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls shake, and the streets are seen in the lights of the plastered plaster.
I think it's all right.
And the local people say, "You don't think it is."
Living in the 18th - century wooden house is very difficult, says Tatiana Luquiananova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the public guard, but it's not spent tens of years on it, and we're feeling like museum exhibits that the authorities just forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still thin, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet to the street, and they pray once a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be content in such a situation?
The road passes right under the windows, not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatian's putting off the curtain.
It is now clear that it has only been heard that the cars are flowing under the windows.
You see, the glass is always timbered, the windows cannot open, they're used to noise.
And man is accustomed to what is good and bad.
Our apartment is even more exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are gold.
Still, we have two rooms, three with our son.
And other families have a much worse condition, on the second floor, the ceiling is a little over one and a half feet tall.
To contrast, Tatiana proposes to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 of Ludmila Oldestina.
A nice, hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and says with a sad smile:
We have a room room, 14.5 m2 per four, and we live with my husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I've been here since my birth, there's never been another place, and Lucila's looking at the room: antresoli, two couchs with the letter "g", and one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and few are different from the normal domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But the ceiling regularly flows: the water pipeline does not go anywhere.
Sophia speaks of her apartment at the same time as a Italian woman whose house is on the ruins of Rome.
So it's going to be one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water supply was spent some 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we had a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from a former chat room.
We live just where Demids and his family lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, is it why?
The Ufa Reality Centre says privatization doesn't matter.
Still, we'll get just one room apartment, we can't claim for more.
Four months ago, we were promised to be settled, but the promises did not go further.
I'm not used to complaining and I won't.
This apartment (room!) has lived a whole dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and Daddy, my husband and my daughter with the granddaughter.
Anything has happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the fligel walls, they're a metre thickness!
They say the solution was confused on the eggs, so it's been a long time.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
Only that's probably why nobody's killed in the ceiling or yours.
Only the building still slowly dies in our eyes: the boards and the logs of the houses rot, the floors have failed repeatedly, we have cemented, but everything is useless is going to the ground like a well.
They say it's under our secret lobster room and the move to the Bela River that was specifically done by some old agers here to get away from the danger, in case.
They were persecuted.
Sophia Oldestin tells us how some historian came to them, begging him to let him start digging in the apartment.
And then I persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for one of them on the October projection.
Sophia refused to tell the historian:
Where are we going four to one?
There's even a small hope here that will make housing more spacious.
We're not going to win anything, will we?
In fact, the Elderly family won nothing.
The greatest dream of Ludmila was to be settled and a separate room was given to a daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter.
So two families have a two-room apartment instead of the most magnificent ruins in which two generations live now.
A sympathetic, miniature girl named Olesi Carsakova from House Nos. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two close rooms, a total of 23 m2, called the apartments, there is a large family of hers.
We're seven people, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
Slices like window frames, walls in the kitchen and in the rooms are cut off.
It's only cold in the tap year.
As you walk through the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that Lavrentyev's spouses are the most fortunately from Housing No. 4.
They're holding the most outer rooms on the first floor.
You're right, lots of places!
75 squares, three people.
We live just in the rooms where Suvorov, by legend, stopped while he was in Ufah, says the head of the family, Alexander Dmitriev Lavrentev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing, everything's shining around the seams, falling apart, moving.
The neighbors must have told you!
The most torment we have with the floors: the wooden boards were rotten, the ground was literally out of the foot.
I've set up a clinья, nothing in the hall, and in the other room, we're going like we're rolling on the ducks, so much tough.
Alexander Dmitrievich can best tell any guide about the merchant of Evdokima Demidov.
The gold industry is regarded as a family member, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the person was intact: the owner of the Kaginski and Uzian factories built houses, drank guns and bells, and held Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant are proud of their forefathers, but they no longer want to live under one roof with history.
I lived here as a child in the '40s of the 20th century,' says Alexander Dmitrievich.
During that time, the wooden rooms for carats, cones, and caravan benches were surrounded, which were subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clean up our house, but something prevented...
The story was repeated in 2014: once again, they took a new home.
As a team, we collected all the documents, we missed the necessary authorities, and suddenly we learned that moving to the apartments was 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe all of this anymore...
Two years ago, Laurentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the home.
The residents didn't accept it.
They sent a paper from one table to another, and then, like a ridicule, issued a paper without a signature and a press, "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the inhabitants."
I have even felt that our home has long been out of town, since first it was number 57, then 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like he's been demolished in the '70s.
The Russian Planet addressed the lead sector of land information and analysis management of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The October Revolutionary House 57/1 is included in the old housing resettlement programme.
I can't be responsible for the 1970s officials, but I know that there was a plan at the time to demolish all old houses, despite historical significance.
Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities to rebuild all the old houses on the streets of the October Revolution representing architectural value is being successfully implemented.
The residents are expected to be settled in new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, Italian experts who participated in the rebuilding of the buildings in Venice will be re-establishing the House of Demidov.
An architectural biennale is under way in Italy, and the Stara Ufa project is presented there among the others.
I hope that by the year 2016, the entire old Kazana street will be rebuilt, says the official.
Houses will be acquired with a proper view that was the same as before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to be a museum open to all.
In addition, at the Government level, it is decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
It's unfortunately not going to work, too much traffic in the city.
Russelling people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
On the other hand, they are unlikely to be satisfied that their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Only from another age.
Thunderstorm fires started in Primorje.
The dry thunderstorm has caused a forest fire in the area of Forestry in the Groundland of Primars.
There is an increase in the grouping of forces and funds on the ground of fire.
According to the Primar Airbase management, the conditions created at the fire site require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasili Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Airbase:
The fire that arose in a difficultly accessible area found an observer aircraft on board an en-2 patrol aircraft at 3 hectares.
The wood remains are burned on the old burner.
The high denseness of the Territory and the slope of the slope of more than 45 degrees, and the absence of fire-fire dispersed landings pose considerable difficulties in the cleaning.
We need a MI-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the aircraft at the disposal of the Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four firefighters were quickly planted.
The main task of the professionals is fire extinguishing and the preparation of the site for the delivery of additional fire and fire extinguishing forces.
In the area of lunch, 3 fire-fighting aircraft have been brought to the village area by helicopter.
Once the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, the specialists will be thrown to the place of detonation, reported on the Primor district administration website.
My father never hugs me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born in the immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in 1958 in Midlands.
His father, who died when Henry was 19 years old, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Red plates, which is partly based on the imaginary conversations with his father and has grown from the radio 4 series.
The soundtrek is a mixture of reggue and rap, and the music is a lively mixture.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, there was a “many ” treatment, and Henry often thinks about his father's relations.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, but you've heard his voice say,
Stay away from my sister.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a kid, were walking with him in pubs and talking about things like a beer glass form, the beauty of a screaming blow.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an uncomfortable guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a Lieutenant Workshop in the Dadley and, although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to see what his life must have been.
Now it's a little better, but it's dark, smoked, deep labyrinths with flames and smoke and soot.
My father crawled into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him sing slowly about himself, because he wanted to wash himself off the linen workshop.
When I came there, I realized that he was doing this for years and years to earn our food, and I appreciated it more.
Nevertheless, Henry left his child with no parental love.
My father never hugs, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love he lacked in childhood.
Can you stop this "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don Frank.
Why don't I make friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still great friends with Frank, where he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I have friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So, when I was very, very well recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious exercise of phytens, and I also had to sit on a rigorous diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
Nobody eats carrots.
The change in Henry's career path is probably reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he got the critics for his Otello, he's been completely in the theater.
The "Love Comic" followed, and then Ogasta Wilson's Fence.
This work is different from that of the titcoms and comedies that were an integral attribute of its intense professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 years old and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed how he marched on the stage and wrote about it in "New faces."
His TV career began in the mid-70s, "I've been the only black paradigm on television for a long time."
He was at work.
Not only did I have to grow in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joking machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in “New Persons” in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the Black and White minstrels show, a light entertainment program where people have "injected their face," Henry found out he's been in it for five years.
My family really didn't like that.
I think I want this never to happen to me, but I'm not sorry I've done it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a crowd.
But what was "the prize of the easy entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was a grotesque parrodium for black people.
In introducing the characters who mocked and singed the black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighty.
The first season of Shaw Lenny Henry was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineteenth season it was known as, among other things, Chief Gareth Blacklock of the "Sheff!" Commodity Serial.
Advertising videos, documentary movies, TV series and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series in 2008, Lenny Henry.tv, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling out time or slowing down."
Then there was a documentary series on Radio 4 called "What's good at...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy on Shakespeare.
You can't say that I was taught it in school, and I thought it was a lot of the prerogative of the middle-class whites with collisions and poops downstairs.
So I was really afraid of him.
Everybody we took interviews for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't swear until you know what you're talking about.
Speak out some of these words, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Otello monology for documentary transmission, and he was caught.
I have a feeling that I can.
Somehow my head was fixed.
"Whatever it is, this is a serious case, take it seriously, teach your own text, conduct a small study.
So the rehearsal process was rigid, and I read this play months and months before we put it.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for a catastrophe, and she didn't happen.
Soon we started the Error Communicator.
Suddenly I was in the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it to the end.
There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical breakdown, and Henry instinctively felt that his case was to entertain the public.
"The quiet voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're doing a computer."
Instead, the assistant director announced that the submission would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the scene, and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else figure it out.
"You play a play, stay in play."
Henry's in the Fights at Daches theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the Fences.
Panic's quite useful, it's strengthening the musculature.
She was also well accepted, so it was like a sign from above showing, "That's what you need to do."
He says it, of course, in a GROUGH voice.
So I'm holding it.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry's still having a comic thinking -- all the way our conversation is interrupting the outbreaks of his humor when he starts, he ends parodizing.
I just decided not to work in the standup because this thing with instant remuneration from the full room of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you're trying to do that all the time, it can lead to a stalemate.
I sometimes work in the Apollo Premium when I want to, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm wondering if he'll give the bandade tour one day.
It's a pleasure to sit in a room with a director who's helping to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give it up.
So that's his new embodiment?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a nice fun.
You always tell a story, and here's a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers public officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has started the biometric registration of all public employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the Government's payroll.
Staff members who are not registered within the next two weeks will no longer be paid are reported in the Government statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive their salaries after the resignation of the public service.
President Uhuru Keniata promised to reduce corruption in government structures after he came to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (700,000) per month was missing from non-visible workers and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that wages continue to apply to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, report BBC Vanjama Chebusiri, from the capital, Nairobi.
All public officials are required to appear within the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, is reported in a government statement.
Anyone who does not do so without consideration will be excluded from the payment statement, as reported therein.
“This procedure will contribute significantly to the streamlining of the public service by determining the actual number of public officials, and will also be used to clear the payroll statement at both levels of the Government, thus end the problem of “invisible workers”, said Ann Wyguru, Secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structure of Government.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the “conspiracy” against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the Government”, reports local information agencies.
The police did not comment immediately.
Among the detainees were 14 high-level officers, according to Hurriet Daley News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish policemen were arrested on suspicion of establishing an organized criminal group and listening to the telephone.
President Rejep Tayip Erdogan of Turkey (who was then Prime Minister) identified their actions as part of the measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic Clergy of Fethulah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine opened their doors again on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This day has traditionally been a major event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniya Yatzyuk has taken his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do his best to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held at every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for the peaceful heavens.
All Ukraine, the huge single Ukrainian people ' s front, must fight for the peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastukhov, director of the school in Slaviansk, whose daughter Jaceniuk went to talk Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will be given knowledge that will benefit them in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead BBC, maybe she found such an impressive leader as she needs.
It is followed by a fame line from the banking world, the media administration and the interior of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leading positions.
Her career began at the Bain and Co Global Administration Consulting Company, and then continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the Pearson Media World.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior post in the Principal Company of Pearson's took up a lower male colleague.
It is said that her earnings are approaching $1 million.
Its political rating is also valid.
She was advised by David Cameron Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehol: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband's former counselor Tori.
Previously in May, I called the chairman's work on poisoned cups.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in the heart of public life but it has an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside both the top level of the management hierarchy of BBC itself, but outside the voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
It is an almost incomprehensible duel, which requires complete radical reform.
But what a new chairman would risk coming, stirring up and destroying the institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty if he had lost his own job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be pleased to see BBC drop in size after revising its powers, finance and status.
As competitors narrow down the circle and new technologies challenge the comfortable old habits, the inevitable cost-of-licensing negotiations pose a special threat to BBC.
For a modest amount of $145.50 per year, British are likely to take a share in the largest media enterprise in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 per cent of households and stands for each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, the popularity of Beeb is obviously increasing: 53 per cent support it today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
The BBC view and use models have changed: now I get news headers on the mobile phone and I'm looking for the iPlayer missed programs.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs a powerful chairman, I hope he found him.
Perry of Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
Tweet from the confirmed account of the Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on a Sunday night, contained an offensive image of the district prosecutor from the democrats, which is at the centre of the prosecution for the abuse of power.
The Tweet was removed later, followed by another account from Perry, where the record was cheated.
I just published a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I stripped it," reports a later record.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the communications requested to comment.
Although the records were downloaded from the confirmed account of Perry, it was not clear who was actually engaged in publishing on the tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unfair cartoon at the Procurator of Travis Rosmarie Lemberg District, who was found guilty of driving in an alcoholic condition in April 2013.
Perri banned the financing of her department when she refused to resign, leading to a large jury in Austina this month against Perry, a potential candidate for the 2016 elections.
The signature in the Tweet says, "I don't always drive a car in a state of drunkenness, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood... but when I do that, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it."
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg statement did not investigate with the participation of a large jury against Perry.
They were in charge of Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not admit his guilt and said that the charges were political tricks.
His powerful legal team had asked the judge leading the case to reject the indictment, stating that the law used to prosecute the governor, who did his duties longer than everyone in the history of Texas, was vague, contrary to the Constitution.
Perri has stopped funding by $7.5 million from the State Public Control Division, based in the Travis district, and is pursuing corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg resigned.
The Veto made a formal complaint by the left-wing public control team.
The position of the confirmed account Perry is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
When Perry came to the fifth party's convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, he responded to rumours that he could come out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running near the lake and saying, "Here we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to the "normal state"
One of the most famous London builders warned that the real estate market in South-East England “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were the subject of renewed demand and rapidly rising prices, and there was widespread fear that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pigley, founder and president of the Berkeley Elite Construction Company, said on Monday, “From the beginning of the current financial year the market has returned to the normal level of transactions since the peak of 2013”, adding that this provided a “steady working environment”.
The London real estate market was successful during the downturn, as foreign buyers had gone to the capital.
The cost of the city had risen by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Inventories, significantly overturned the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices for private, accessible and student schemes of Berkeley rose by about one fifth last year, reaching 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new taxes on real estate and political rhetoric around the potential “noon for specialists” before the general elections in the next May.
Foxtons, London Real Estate Agency last week, warned that the April Mortgage Market Reform, which introduced stricter terms for loans, would also reduce market growth, both real estate sales transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, presuming that the housing market would continue to cool.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, reduced its 2015 projection for the growth of London real estate prices to 3 per cent on the basis that real estate prices have already begun to weaken.
In the meantime, transactions fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfer and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital proved to be very beneficial for Berkeley by raising sales amounts above 2.2 billion dollars.
Mr. Pigley added, "The demand for the right goods with good design and the best location remains the same and, reflecting this, the sales have been retained for a period of time."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new houses this year before the end of April, almost one third more than the 2007 pre-crisis peak.
Annual revenues to taxes have risen by 40 per cent, compared with the previous year to 380 million dollars, income by 18 per cent to $1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the annual assembly of the company, Mr. Pigley reported that the expected income of Berkeley for that year would meet current market expectations.
According to analysts, the year before taxes were paid is expected to yield 450 million £450 million.
Berkeley's share value was 23.96 pounds in the afternoon of the London Exchange.
Photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th ceremony of an annual American cinema award.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who received the Oscar Prize, were placed on the Internet by a hacker who assures that he has a directory of another 100 rising stars.
The representative of the Hungry Games Star confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence were real, and condemned the hacker for the "strong incursion into personal space."
The law enforcement authorities have been contacted and will be persecuted by anyone who publishs the stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
Photographs originally placed on the 4chan photo exchange site were allegedly obtained due to the lack of an online storage system Apple iCloud, and the alleged “directory” of victims of hacking includes the names of dozens of women bearing names, including Riana, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's not clear how many of these photographs are true, though Winstead in Twitter also condemned theft.
"Whoever looks at the pictures that we did with our husband a few years ago by being alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstead in Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nickolodeon "iCarly" and Victoria-Conquerer" refuted that she, in her photographs, wrote in Twitter, "These so-called photos of the naked FALSHIBKI, people.
Let me stop it in the embryo.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that the Ariana Grande, a representative of the pop star, had refuted that the photos in which she was supposed to be true.
Exclusive quote from Howard Jacobson's new novel on love and the letter "J" that praised critics.
They were dissolved, and the best thing to say was that they gradually collapsed like a cardboard box left under the rain.
Only at times did the woman tell him that he was too serious, too heavy in association, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritating.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability of himself.
He was a thorn like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this thorn was a little novel from which he waited for more than usual to get rid of lonely and boring life and perhaps even some kind of satisfaction.
Aileen Solomons was a fragile, fragile beauty with fragile hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more distant and harsh than Port Royben.
She came south with a friend older than herself, which Kevern thought she was an aunt, and she inherited a home in a raw but a paradise valley called the Rain Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The hubs flowed, sitting spiders in the baths motionless, and the slippers left their footprints on all the windows assured that the house belonged to them; the garden sprouted with weeds like giant cats of cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a child book, while frightening and charming, with a full secret garden.
The author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" novel is included in the Bucker Prize Longlist in 2014.
The Shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Aileen were sitting behind their hands in broken herds among the high grass, enjoying a sudden warm spring day; both of them dispersedly connected to the cheap convoy, which provided the country with peaceable music and soothing news when, looking at its twisted brown legs, he remembered the old song of a long forgotten black performer, which his father liked to listen to by putting the curtains in the house.
You have too big feet.
Because of their aggressiveness, they didn't play a song like that on a convoy anymore.
They were not banned - nothing was forbidden - just didn't lose them anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, as the word "arhaic."
The public taste was doing things that could never have been accomplished by orders and regulations, and just as people in books chose rich memoirs, growing in poverty, kitchen books, and love novels from all the music they chose ballads.
Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing Aileen’s big legs.
Aileen doesn't get it.
"It was a popular jazz pianist song called Fats Waller," he said to her, machinering two fingers to the lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before she flies off his lips.
It started with the game they played when they were little.
His father played it with his father as he told him.
Start with J, forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew he was waiting for it, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Aileen's never heard of him.
Jazz didn't play either, although he wasn't banned openly.
The improvisation came out of fashion.
There's only one place left in life.
When the tune began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Excellent, too.
His unpredictability was on the nerve.
And jazz was an appetite expressed by music.
Although he was 10 years old and never heard of Sammi Davis Mladsh, Kevern knew of a jazz from a father's half secret compact-disk collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Aileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered the time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude -- thanks to those who had been saved -- with the principle of group bias.
People of Afro-Caribian origin, according to thermality and physical characteristics, were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
The ancestors, as if from nature, were talented in everything about electronics, so that no family would remain without a working electronic phone.
The remains of the Polish diaspora were sanctioned; what was left of the Greek was the beating of the plates.
The Gulf of Persia and Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country, when TWO, THAT TRIPE, had taken place, feared that they had been accused of incitement to flames, feared, in fact, that the flame would swallow them, opened restaurants with the lab and the Kalians, did not push out and missed the indifference.
Everybody by their abilities.
Since she had heard only ballads before, Aileen was hard to understand how insulting words that Kevarn just said to her could have been placed on music at all.
Music is a expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevarn.
Unless it's possible for people with big legs.
My father never offended anyone, but he admired this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him an illusion of security.
No word could be penetrated through the sound insulation of giant leaves like cabbages.
Aileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to pinch the lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"Him it seemed funny," he said instead.
She cracked her head incredibly, shutting down Kevernae's review.
There was nothing in the whole world except the drapery of her black hair.
Nothing he'd like to look at.
"Well, if you say that," she said, staying in her opinion.
But it doesn't explain why you're eating it to me anyway.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles may be a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"I like you because you have fat ankles," he tried to say instead.
I have such an aversion.
That sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be ridiculous.
Attempts to make jokes often made him embarrassed, because like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the atrocities that had burst out in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, Kevarn.
Notwithstanding good eyes.
Aileen Solomons painted and stood up from herslon, twisting the console and the shed of the wine they drank.
Wine from the basin, so drunkenness could not serve as a justification for it.
In her excitement, she seemed to trembling like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you just because you have a stupid head," she said...
Although you don't like it.
He was sorry for her and because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her mind when she gave him a refusal.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn't talk to him about living in a cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that in the main traits she looked like an outside archipelago.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and disgusting after THOSE, THAT WAS ALL ALL ALL OVER than their ancestors, smugglers and destructors, wandered in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand on any woman who dared to refuse or jeopardize them.
A stupid head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
First, kissed, the kiss is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between the man and the woman; the antidote from the fresh ballot that the console gave is to kiss her first and then to strike.
A superfluous clarity, according to Kevern, because the kiss was a bully in itself.
Aileen Solomons showed him that he had to leave.
He got out of the chase like an old man.
She felt lead weight herself, but his woe surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and out of the top window, she watched him go away, her friend was a man who had himself been struggling.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought.
She was inclined to show compassion to him and to men at all, even though some of them were lifting their hands upon her.
The man who turned away from her, with his screwed back, stripped, beaten, all the ability to fight left him -- why did she think she knew it so well if she couldn't remember any case, until today when she could see it?
Aileen Solomons again looked at her feet.
Twenty years before or about the above events, an intelligent and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ophnau, an informal public mood monitoring service, has prepared a small report on the persistence of low and medium-level violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline if it did not cease at all, given the means and forces that had been allocated to its eradication.
“Many things have been done, and much is done,” she wrote, “to alleviate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in the thousands of wars and won most of them, especially among these intertwined branches and narrow veins of the area, where, despite the frozen churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has seldom been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities are not eliminated.
The higher the spilt seems to be the lower the passions it produces.
The population shed tears over the sentimental ballads, swallows stories of the obstacles that have been overcome, and declares its fervent faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness maintains its strong suffocation both in rural and urban settlements, but there is evidence that new and malignant storing in homes, in workplaces, on roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have a nasty practice of writing too much," said her scientific supervisor, reading the report entirely.
I think you should read less novels.
Essме Nusbaum put her head down.
I also have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I'm obliged to answer," said Esse Nusbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I'm asking," finally said Luther Rabinovits, "not because I'm against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypervisibility, perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, may sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you're biased against the church, or what you call "wicked" and "crime," others would interpret as a expression of natural love and energeticity.
To continue to miss the TOM, which has been done, WHILE ENDED, as if it had occurred, if at all, yesterday, it would deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esse Nusbaum looked around while Rabinovits spoke.
On his head, pink, like flamingo, light-driven letters repeated the advice Ophnau gave the country the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile your neighbor, price your spouse, listen to the ballad, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, a word better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you want to say," answered Esse Nusbaum quietly when she found out that her scientific leader had finished saying, "and I don't want to say anything except that we didn't cure ourselves as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I am concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to that which was done, unless it was done.
Only this time will we throw our anger and distrust against others.
Luther Rabinovits put the tips of the fingers together in the pyramid.
This gesture must have meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "to name "fronts" of actions that our grandparents did or did not.
You're going too far and when you're talking about they've thrown their "gungs" and "distrust" on "others."
In your place, no man should need to remind us that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "no."
There was no "us" and there was no "others."
It was a riot, that's all we know.
"For which, if you're honest with yourself," dared to insert Esma, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what's done, it's done.
It was then.
Nothing else to say, we're here to agree.
And as no one should be blamed, you shouldn't justify yourself if that was appropriate or could be corrected.
But why is the past, if not to learn?
It's the last thing we've done to forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther's pyramid Rabinowitz has collapsed.
"I'll review your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was beaten by a motorcyclist who went to the sidewalk, as the passersby described, "in an abusive rage."
Coincidence occurs.
Lesotho Army states that the coup was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The Lesotho Army protested the coup d ' état to overthrow the Government, stating that they had acted against the police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, stating that his army surrounded his official residence and captured government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
Premier had taken his family to neighbouring South Africa, stating that he had been threatened by an attempt on his life.
The representative of the Army, Major Ntlelele Ntoi, said that there was actually no coup, but that the army had reacted to the threat from the “political fanatics” that the police had attempted to arm.
“What happened this morning is that Lesotho's command of the Armed Forces has taken measures, having received several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties that were ready to build chaos”, he informed the American Voice.
The representative of the Government of South Africa, Clayson Moniela, said that the military was a coup.
“While no one has filed any claim for the seizure of power by force, the actions of the Lesotho Armed Forces have at present the main signs of the coup,” he said.
Lesotho's army reported that the soldiers had returned to barracks on Sunday and that it was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottjoa Metsing runs the Government in the absence of the Taban.
Tabane stated that he believed that he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to combat corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabana suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of differences in its combined Government.
He stated that his actions did not undermine the Government despite allegations of retrospect.
Marco van Ginkel will hold the forthcoming season of lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
During the past season, he was only three times on the field of the London Club.
Remember, Milan used to rent the Liverpool of an attacker, Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at the lowest 13 months
The growth in Eurozone has slowed down to the lowest 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the Business Activity Index (PMI) of the Eurozone Production Sector on Markit fell to mark 50.7 in August, declining from 51.8 in July.
The value of above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and enterprises were affected by growing tensions between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values were given to the European Central Bank (ECB) Assembly on Thursday.
The market will look forward to a clear plan on how to deal with the restoring of the eurozone, as well as with the threat of deflation in inflation of only 0.3 per cent.
It is suggested that the head of ECB Mario Dragi later this week may give additional signals that he considers the quantitative mitigation scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"While there's a better growth than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers becomes more evident," said Rob Dobson, the economist Markit.
The PMI of the German manufacturing sector, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of marking 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economy of the block, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a source of concern, as is the weakening of Italy from steady growth to stagnation.
Mr. Dobson said that the notion that the momentum of growth has deprived mostly of the industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands does not add confidence.
Industry deceleration is likely to continue to overtake oil into the fire for analysts awaiting additional coinary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist IHS Global Insight, said, “The best thing that we can say about the August Business Indices Index of the Eurozone Production Sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Eurozone producers appear to find life very difficult at the present time, as the current growing geopolitical tensions, especially with Russia/Ukraine, add uncertainties to the complexities of many countries.
This increased tension seems to have been hit by business - especially on the basis of consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders are delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that "more and more" that the ECB would eventually have to do some quantitative mitigation, although we suspect it would be limited."
Mariupoli’s Cycle Against the Ombassadors
In Maríupol until last week, everything was calm -- no one was rushing to organize the Maríul People’s Republic, the city on the Azov Sea was living and working.
The inhabitants are now horrible to wait for the "militia" to come.
According to politicians, separatists are breaking through Mariuplu to get to the Azov Sea - recently the city of Novoazovsk, which has not been part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariulers decided that the Ukrainian army would, though, protect them, but it had a little force against the well-armed DNR-LNR representatives and had gathered to help the military.
They roam trenches, build blocks and reinforcements.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city, and they got into the live chain, spraying the hymn of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same in the event of an attack.
The volunteers collect and carry food and equipment, collect medicines, and publish the newspaper.
The city is gradually closed by shops, banks and banks stop working.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years from the gruesome takeover of school like children in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militia at Beslan school in southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of whom were children, were killed during this three-day test, which struck the world
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who lied to death during the atrocities at school.
About ten years later, after the horrible seizure of a non-lane school, 334 people were killed, including 186 children, who had been heroic survivors of the catastrophe to warn of the new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be somewhat extremely possible evil.
The tragedy united the east and the west in the abhorrence, which, in a remarkable way, moved into action and hope for the future in the face of the greatest tribulation.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who lied to death during school atrocities.
We have discovered amazing young people who have been confronted by the adversity, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now plagued by Ukraine, where children like them are dying, will now cease.
A girl who's trying to get back to the fired sports room in a photograph.
She's sealed in a picture of a famous Russian photographer, Dmitry Beljakov, when she was trying to get back to the fired sports hall after the mine exploded.
In disappointment, Aid desperately sought out her mother, Laris, now 40.
They were afraid they both died, but they actually survived.
"The woman told me to run with all my strength, but I couldn't," said Aida.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After the queue of operations, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I might need more operations.
A few slices are left in my knee.
Now her goal is to be a dentist, to help people, just as the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn't break it," she said with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this sports room to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it in other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, was killed there by Dera Gapoev.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed that we would go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the seizure stays with her, although memories are slightly dark every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from Britain and everywhere.
When I see a picture on the Internet where I go into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make it stop.
The boy who ran through the guns, thinking his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (the Russians begin school at seven years of age) and survived three days of capture by hugging their mother Tamarou.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was a blast and hold it behind the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Fetch."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the road saw a weeping baby, grabbed the child by the hand, and ran through the hail bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said, "Damir told me his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was hospitalized with leg wounds, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hug me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent News of the World), where he was rewarded as Child Protection from the Barnardo's Prime Tony Blair Foundation and his wife, Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that I remember he's nimbling.
I remember just after that I dropped all my toy guns.
But now I can play games with gunshots, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that sports hall, but I don't think of myself.
I remember the kids I played in the courtyard with who didn't pick up.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the sports room.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store, where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted, and to travel in an open car.
But now he is afraid of places such as Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damire, who had been engaged in volunteer work last week in a women's monastery.
I want to help.
I want to serve in the police someday, and hopefully I'll be put in the school academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, aged 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the tranquillity immediately after the capture, just there were no children yelling and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damire.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
I have learned when people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sheri Blair and her fund for that reward and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her herself that 10 years has passed, but I still remember meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damire wanted to eat a bitch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waitresses in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think this world hasn't become better in those 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just children like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of this.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or evil.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not loose on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six classmates, and they go to the sports room from time to time, and light the candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this--I remember he was lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
Don't sleep, his eyes were opened.
I also remember how he dumped all his weapons and other military toys.
I find it hard to believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and stand on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell around me when parts of the bodies were everywhere.
I was absolutely confident that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
Thus life continues for us, unlike so many others.
George Illyn, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photograph after the capture became the determinant of the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: survivor of Beslan Georgi Illyn with his mother Fatima after the seizure in 2004 and on the right of George today
His bloody face was a sign of fear when he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his older son, Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of nightmare," she remembered.
Not all alone, there was a family of our relatives, but all of them were killed.
Only my George was able to survive.
The closer that date, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
No one day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some of the scenes of these days have been in my eyes all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Fountains: Georgia's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanted to go to school that day, saying he wanted to hug a teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like looking at this picture, and she's hidden in the bookstore in our house.
I understand, but I also feel that this photograph makes people from all over the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever learn the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
They're now investigating the Boing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what it was called?
This world is coming to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, no one wants war, since it's happening?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
We need to go through tens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago, I had nightmares because of the capture, but now it's getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this sports room before September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood.
It's hard for me to enter the sports room, but I have to do it.
I don't feel sacrificed, this story is part of my past now.
I will not forget it, but I do not feel sorry for myself.
My life is going on.
I graduated from school this year and went to a medical university in Vladicavcas.
I'll learn to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military, but my health was not allowed.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived, even though he was at the feet of the killer terrorist
It's unlikely that George Farniev was at the feet of the killer terrorist during the seizure, but he was able to survive.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderer.
Indeed, it's a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We think it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to learn from an intelligence officer at the FSB, but was unable to do so because of the damage caused by his health during the seizure.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to handle bad things, I have to say it's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little better afterwards, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, next year, I was the first and last time I went into this sports room again.
I've lost my mind.
I'd never go there again, and please don't ask me to show me where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgi Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital open on the laptop after the seizure
My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like thinking about it or discussing it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking fine.
But still my health didn't allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical findings, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second attraction was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institution.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all the animals from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not what the children should know, and of course not what they're supposed to survive.
His mother, Marina, aged 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremony to be held to celebrate it.
I know George won't go.
For him she should be even stronger because he was there, and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He stays with us.
Georgie's grown-up now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something is so bad, it's happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do it on his knee.
He's got a few operations, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say that he's 50% overtaken that nightmare, but it's impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the seizure, and this only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and which were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who have never been married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I see what is happening in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out we're fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and a lot will be killed.
If you could grab all the rebels and throw them out, as far as you can.
Alona Tzkaev, 10 years old
The baby who was touched by the scourge of the Sharpnaza
Saved: Aleon Tzkaev is carrying a Russian Skatchawa fighter (left).
She's now ten, and she doesn't remember a terrible crime.
The world had stopped breathing in 2004, when little Alena was handed over by a Russian policeman from a school captured in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but they brutally abandoned her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christine and Brother Mahara in the sports hall.
Mahar, who was three years old, was rescued, but Elina's mother and sister died in a fatal slaughter.
Her father, Russen, has since married again, and they and his new wife, Svetlana, have a little daughter he called Christina in memory of the daughter he had lost.
Alena, who's now ten, doesn't remember the seizure, and she's bloomed into a smart and cheerful girl, they're talking to her neighbors.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.
Sinji Kagawa, a defendant from Manchester United to the Dortmund Boroussia, said he was looking forward to returning to the field in the form of a German club.
He said that this transfer is a joyous career event.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm gonna play "Borussy again," quotes the Bild words of Kagawa.
I feel very good.
Positive emotion floor, and I look forward to going to the field again in the form of "Borussy."
Remember, Kagava moved to the MJ from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was unable to fit into the English club by having only 38 matches in two seasons in England’s championship, killing six balls, and giving eight effective gears.
A man is accused of going to a girl on a pedestrian crossing in Faif
A 78-year-old man will be brought before a three-year-old girl on the pedestrian crossing in Faifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl on the transition to Pittenvin in East Newk.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stewart had led his Audi Q3 without proper caution and attention and had beaten the girl, resulting in trauma.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruter, denied his guilt to the Sheriff Court of Dundee.
Sheriff Charles McNeir, a royal lawyer, appointed the date of trial on January.
Obama, Mercel and Ollland will not be contested in Vladivostok.
The dutyless trade magistrate Duty Free Airport Vladivostock put out a plate prohibiting purchases at the store for a number of world political leaders.
Don't turn them away with the spirits, the waters, and the horses.
The shop administration decided that President Barak Obama of the United States, FRG Chancellor Angela Mercel, French President François Olland, Vitaly Clinko, Julia Timoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan, and several other well-known associates would not be able to invade their store with water, horses and spirits.
And she put a plate on the door.
Obama had previously been banned in an even less-accessed institution service - Diethical Crown MHCs, as reported by the general institution site.
Whether the U.S. president had ever had a dream of eating in a dietary dining room in Russia, we don't know, but the authors of the bans seem obviously frightening to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev advised Agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian agrarians should learn new technologies in order to set up raw materials for buyers.
The Council was given during the visit of South-Ptiptaker to Agrocomplex.
The Head of Government also advised the Restorators to reorient to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the appropriate level.
The annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The chief coach of the Russian assembly, Valentine Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparations for competition.
Our athletes have spoken at their own level, and the "Sport" brings Maslakova's words.
The third place is the confirmation of our sufficiently high commander level.
It's nice that the advantages of the French and even the Americans over us are minimal.
We have to consider that we have not been preparing for these competitions.
The session has been completed, and we have not begun to oblige our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become the second in this tournament, but this season has renewed the assembly.
On the contrary, the French exhibited a capable team of 13 European championships.
They did not conceal their intention to defeat this year, which was publicly announced many times.
But even such hosts could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians have spoken in such a representative company at a good level.
But in some species, the results were lower than in the same Blue League.
The sezone's over.
Naturally, the athletes are no longer so important, but more so in command-level competitions.
The main place was here.
And as a result, it's going to be absurd when 1500 metres of men were so admired by the tactical craftsmanships of running, that they showed the result below the average level... of women's runs.
4 hints on how to improve the quality of submarine photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos below water, you have a number of options for the appliance.
The cheapest option is a watertight "mile", for example Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an ex-camer, e.g. GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for approximately $300.
I took those pictures at the family holiday with a couple of cameras, all at about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, several rules need to be respected in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery of the camera and other parts are closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos that you will take.
Some photo and video cameras have survey modes or type of object that optimize the exhibition for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping in the water, see how deep your appliance can fall.
Some cameras are only 5 feet, others 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our customer management and digital camera ratings for both traditional and watertight models.
Take off some staff because many of them won't.
The "minks" have a CCD that will help you compose images, whereas the ex-camer usually doesn't have them.
Even if you have a VCD, it'll be hard to see underwater, and the componing of the frame will be a random process.
So do some staffing.
Also, if your camera has a serial snapshot regime that takes off a few staff with a little different exhibition installations, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The number of lights is declining considerably, the deeper you are diving under water.
If possible, stay at the surface when you take off in a pool, river, or ocean.
This will also allow you to transmit more colors on photographs; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Get closer to the sites.
It's a great advice for land-based surveys, but it's even more important underwater because of dark light conditions.
Particularly important if you take off an extra camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, broad-carbon lens, which means that you will have to get closer to the site if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Bronze Fighter in the Free Battle of Bilal Mahov can move into the Greek-Russian struggle.
This was reported by the Chief Dagestan Coach in the free fight of Sajid Sajid.
The specialist did not exclude athletes from the Tashkent World Cup in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Mahov is at the gathering of classic teams, quoting "R-Sport" for Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, for the young men, Billal spoke in both styles.
At the 2005 youth world, he became the winner of the vocal tournament and the third gateway in the Greek-Riman competition and decided to concentrate on free struggle.
It's been a long time to talk that the new phase of our career is going to be in the Greek-Russian struggle.
I'll say more: Mahov can be at the Tashkent world championship if he wins the bait.
But the crucial word is always behind the coach headquarters headed by Gogy Coguashvili.
Andrew Lousson was such a person whose strengths of the individual could chase all around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to the relief of sick people, both from sickness and the pain of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls that there was a MI-6 officer who had had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Loison realized that while doctors are involved in diagnosis and disease, those who are treated mostly worry about something quite different is pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who had begun to suffer.
"I didn't feel as usual," he wrote last May.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting symptoms similar to influenza, he discovered that he was provoking his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet left business for a week, Loson found that he was unusual and unclear why upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked the colleague to make the frank X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier, he was riding on skis in the French Alps.
X-rays have come.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the plev, or lung shell.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact reason.
Although some smokers have contracted lung cancer, for example, not all those who have lung cancer have smoked.
But the mesotheliomy is different.
In almost every case, the reason is contact with asbestos, fibre construction material, which was once called a miracle, but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, the mesothelome is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is, after all, a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban entered into force.
Even when he was used, only individuals from specific industries worked closely with him, such as ductors, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another era is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But this calmness is wrong.
Britain appears to be at the peak of the mesothelom epidemic.
Here more people die of mesothelome than any other country on the planet.
With about 2,500 deaths per year, more than twice as many people die of the disease than as a result of road accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelome since 1980 and projected deaths in the future in Britain
The reason why we feel its deadly consequences now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos have ultimately been prohibited by law in 1999), mesotheloms are usually for decades.
And the mesotheliom attack is not limited to the veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestus was, and in many cases, stayed in the houses where we live, offices where we work, schools where we study, and shops where we go shopping.
As a result, the mesothelioma does not pay attention to the class, the level of wealth, the profession or the age.
The election Bastion, from the fashioned London Univermagans to private schools, did not prove to be a salvation.
The Parliamentary Building is asbestos.
Even the hospitals designed to treat us were the reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a tube-isolator.
In fact, he had to think where he could contact asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It sounds like there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels in the Guy Hospital, where I spent six years in an intern," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and trucks used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease.
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to answer partially.
“Of four doctors who have been in the hospital in Gaya who have subsequently developed a mesothelioma in the last five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I have one survived.”
How many of us will suffer from this disease?
Andrew Louson was diagnosed as a mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It's so unusual to live that long.
Fifty per cent of the mesothelome patients die eight months after diagnosis.
She's always deadly.
So now we can just repeat the question of Louson, "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to the British lead expert on mesothelome, Professor Juliana Pito is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is to survive, some 90,000 people will die.
Most now do not think that they will die in that way.

A quick review of reports from court halls, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelome attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Ellen was misconsidered.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at the M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years of age.
"Before this happened," she says, "I've never heard of the mesothelome, I hardly knew about the asbestos.
I couldn't have thought I'd be affected.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They have been named from the word “asbestiform”, which means a fibre structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of those six, three were often used in construction.
Crisotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in the bed panels, in-clutters, thermoidal insulation of tubes, boilers, even braking wells of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “severe source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidal).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, although indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main cause of the solely high number of patients with mesothelio [in Britain]”.
Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the Oxford Street main store, London Alamy.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as the typical victim of the mesothelome, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of the sick, which suggests that “an existing percentage of mesothelic, when no known impact on work or home, was likely caused by the environmental impact of asbestos”.
Most of this, he says, is due to “the usual use and weather impact” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which dealt with the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even at the very heart of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be driven as harmless as “power air flows”.
Members of Parliament were often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seemed that the opposite was the case.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Services Directive insisted that the Westminster Palace had received “pure health certificates”, it now recognized that work should be done at £1 billion in Parliament ' s reconstruction, improved electricity and removed asbestos, and that, after the 2015 general elections, members of Parliament might meet in the QE2 conference centre near the Westminster ' s green benches.
Goddard's report noted that “the situation with asbestos was not regulated in accordance with various rules”.
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who have never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbot, a doctor of general practice.
Like Andrew Lousson, Abbott, 50 years old, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital, which had been successfully filed with asbestos claims," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's hard to remember all the places where you worked and the dates.
That he remembers clearly, that's the day in early December 2009 when something that hit him was like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly, I began to fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbot knew that the pain was coming from the plover, the shell around the lungs.
But like Janice Ellen, he just had no reason to suspect a mesothelio.
Eventually, he could not go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X - rays from the chest and placed tribal catheters to extract the fluid from the lungs and send it to the tests.
Still, his condition remained without diagnosis.
His health gradually improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he had a sport and had a heavy breath.
In 2011, one of Abbot's patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma."
Even then, however, Abbot didn't link it to his own case.
Eventually, his patient was ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbot's condition deteriorated again, and the consulting doctor showed its results to the CT and X-rays to the Team of Specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbot began to feel bad, the camera sensor was placed in a strip between the shell of his chest and the skin of his light.
I'm a optimist.
I usually just go on," he says.
I didn't worry too much about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year, "I've been told that it's mesothelioma."
Gram Abbott: diagnosed mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbot went to meetings with Nurses Macmillan, one of whom invited him to contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where rather often there was asbestos in thermal insulation on the tubes," he says.
People who have been affected by asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from this disease.
Thus, the mesothelioma is now hitting younger people with non-typical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos pipes in the hospitals were in the basements, so it is unlikely that patients would be affected.
But many of the staff members who went through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lousson) or ate in the basement tables (as Graham Abbot often did) were almost certainly exposed to toxic substances.
A few decades after the war, it turns out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, life was saved for the patients, but a place that threatened life for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schools put their bunzen burners on asbestos.
And these aren't just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and mayors because of their amazing isolational and flamestry characteristics.
Schools, too.
In fact, many were likely exposed to asbestos for the first time in the class.
Throughout the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren placed their bunzen burns on asbestos.
Website highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.
In the meantime, in our homes, such harmless things as the tile or roof of the locusts usually contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison in a huge amount of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Louson in a case against Gaius hospital.
In one case, the only contact that the sick woman could recall was the seizure of a garden barn in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful to sleep the garden barrels.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is horrible.
"In order to realize this, it takes a lot of time," says Graham Abbot.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and figure out myself.
Well, I'm not gonna meet Christmas anymore.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from a doctor to a patient's position.
As an inaccessible number of patients before him, he remembers how he was confused with the amount of information he had to accept.
"It was hard to understand," he says.
I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given for about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to meet Christmas anymore.
That's it."
The mesothelome is particularly dangerous, because it is the mechanic of how we support life -- the act of breath -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most of the cases were mesothelomed because of contact with asbestos.
Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.
When asbestos are destroyed and fibers breathe, they can stuck in the puppet, the lung shell.
The asbestos fibers are irritating the pleueutenant and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises because of the inhaling fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Trejer, a cardiocratic surgeon who came to Gay hospital in 2001.
It is the hospital where Andrew Lousson was suspected that he was exposed to asbestos, now an irony of destiny leading the mesothelome treatment centre.
Trejer knew Louson and treated some others who were likely affected by internship at the hospital.
When asbestos fall into the lung tissues, Trejier says, "the breath pushes them on the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process from the outset.
The usual options for treatment of other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesotheliomy.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is a hot dispute.
Some people think it's worth trying.
Trejier doesn't agree.
"It's impossible to cut the play," he says.
You can't get around with the knife.
In the meantime, this cancer is "not very good in chemotherapy" that "acts" but does not heal.
"Sometimes sick people live long," says Trejier.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than they expect.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbot continues to fight.
After he became ill by a mesothelioma, Abbotta was introduced to Andrew Lousson, who, four years after diagnosis had been diagnosed, became a united support and counselling office for the same patients.
"Allo, Rakova Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbot.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
At first, Abbotto was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months to extend his life for a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lousson, however, "who's screwed to give everybody a slightly more positive color."
When Abbot met several professionals, he decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazoundski, a professor of Toracal Surgery at Gay Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need direction, I just called them, and they accepted me," admits Graham.
The average patient would have to receive direction and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for patients with mesotheloids to obtain the best available treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern about the future of families that they will leave.
They then apply to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lousson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was known that asbestos had been harmful to health since 1898," said Morgan.
But what's changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could be at risk.
That's when they talked about the unfairness of companies.
Andrew Lousson and Gaia hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a “full-of-value settlement”, according to Morgan, because Louson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gay Hospital.
After his death was investigated, the representative of the Hospital of Gay confirmed, however, that “the entrance in the basement rooms referred to was removed in the 1990s”.
It was too late for Andrew Louson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, it has been a major problem for the patients with the mesothelioma who are requiring compensation, to be associated with the asbestos with one company or place of work -- usually decades after that.
Many of their former employers have changed their owner or closed their business.
Insurance archives could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against the claims know that there is no time on their side that the plaintiffs have.
In response, this year there were serious new legislation that facilitated the recovery of compensation to the sick, even if their ex-employed employers could not be traced.
Under the Act, a fund of $350 million funded by the insurance industry was established for those who had been diagnosed since July 2012 and who could prove contact but who could not be tried.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case, about $120,000.
Approximately 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that 350 million dollars are “very good work” for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that the amount would amount to a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay if they had not intervened in the interim period and the patients with the mesothelic were able to track the company and file the claim in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, formerly Minister of Labour and Pension, admitted that the law was "unful"
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.
"People suffer so much and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of the Bill on Mesotelium last December.
By then, Graham Abbot was in the hands of Professor Loica Lang-Lazodungski for 19 months.
Following the initial consultations, Lang-Lazoundski recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Trejier, he considered effective.
This was followed by radio therapy and chemotherapy, a three-therapy in which Lanj Lazedungski could be praised by 40 percent of the survivors in five years.
Abbot felt a tide of strength.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbot.
You see it with the patients all the time.
There's some power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition may deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbot was running the operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans have not shown traces of disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were several spots in my chest.
I was just supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbot went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no trace of tumors.
However, it is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things -- finance, when I die, for example, or what you have to show your wife, how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you're disappointed.
We have to look ahead.
As Elly's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It is hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I was diagnosed for the first time, I told girls that I had a disease that means I won't live until I was old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very common and energetic.
She told all her friends, and a lot of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more self-controlled.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancers have to face.
But for those with mesotheloids, such discussions are not balanced by the hope, even by the glimpse of the opportunity to survive.
This disease is a gloomy certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, “the mesothelioma is no life-threatening threat.

Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to manufacture paper (also notes) and tissues.
Large asbestos are opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.

During the Second World War, shipping, one of the most deadly occupations in contact with asbestos, is developing intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in Britain.
The world production of asbestos grows to more than 4,213,000 tons per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tons.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Security in Britain requires that all asbestos contractors be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in Britain.
The use of asbestos is banned in Britain.
The Mésotheliom Act is adopted in Britain.
A compensation scheme of 350 million dollars has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but asbestos are still used in cheap construction materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to grant Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters swear to retaliate
China's Parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reform.
Such a course is likely to commence long- promised protests in the Hong Kong business quarter, as activists began planning and mobilizing in hours after that statement.
The decision of the National People ' s Congress in fact allows Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't mislead our expectations, but it's still fierce," said Legislator Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They deceived Hong Kong's people.
And obviously we're dealing with the authoritarian regime.
Protecting China's decision, Lee Fay, Deputy Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Assembly, said that it would be too “chaotic” to allow the popular election of Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when Britain transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the people of the region to choose by vote the head of Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the decision taken on Sunday as a democratic step forward, since it gave Hong Kong the right to direct vote; however, the decision also made it clear that Chinese leaders would continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the assistance of the Beijing candidates' commission.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision was taken after the summer, when one of the broadest protests that had been held in Hong Kong over the years.
Most of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers threatened to overturn the financial region of Hong Kong unless Beijing guarantees the present universal electoral law.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the application, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in rain before the Hong Kong Government headquarters.
At the demonstrations, the organizers stated that their movement would move to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the following weeks.
However, they did not provide details, evidently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers reported that the movement “considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, action that could be taken only if all the opportunities for the dialogue were exhausted and no other choice.
We are very regrettable to report that to date all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
The State authorities in Hong Kong had been preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and the Government ' s security measures were strengthened on Sunday with the involvement of the police and barricad.
The turmoil is based on the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their own city.
The influx from the mainland increases competition in goods and services.
There is also a growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to diminish under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize Occupy Central, saying that his demonstrations are at risk of Hong Kong’s business source of life.
“The protest they speak of can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long”, said Legislator Regina Yep, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want the concern that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is an idea that is detrimental to investment.
China ' s State media also provided reports in the last days in which the Hong Kong democratic activists were shown by the diversants directed by the western Powers.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which attracted over 780,000 participants, more than one fifth of Hong Kong ' s voters.
And in July, tens of thousands went to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
U.S. Graduate Culturals: First Trainers were invited to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by starting the first "lux" service in Britain for current students.
In order to give a clear impression of the arrival of a university, the company also proposes such transport options as a personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
In conjunction with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students this year get to university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The representative of the company said that since this service had just been launched, no orders had yet been received, but he added that “students would start ordering the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay $9,000 per year, she hoped to find a market for this service.
Nowadays students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago with regard to expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a perfect first impression, and the VIF is exactly what it takes to do.
Nevertheless, the National Union of Students has criticized this service as being excluded from reality.
Megan Dann, Vice President of the NPO, said, "The project seems incredibly cut off from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university education this month are faced with a cost-of-living crisis, when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the fast-growing cost of basic needs before they can even start thinking about getting thousands of pounds out for something like a simple arrival in the community.
Feminists raise the question of race and conduct of the police after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands scanding, "Rooks up, don't shoot," while they're waiting in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri about the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoil Pérez noticed a shift in the internet talk among white feminists.
According to her experience, the white feminists left the commentaries placed a gender higher than race when it was about promoting reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as the tensions in the Middle West increased and attracted national attention, Pérez saw the responses of white women, which focused 100 per cent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the death of 9 August, personal essays with titles such as “Ferguson's thoughts on the face of a white woman” and “Feminism is not only about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Peres, they showed a significant change.
"In feminism, I don't think there's a lot of people talking about white skin colors and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic for the crisis that we have faced and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so linked to race, they felt that it was necessary to point out.
For an English professor at the University of Ohio Corita, Mitchell Ferguson has discovered the problems that black Americans face every day but are not perceived as “women's problems” in the cultural sphere.
"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I'll get 150 rabbits everywhere," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence is deaf.
"Why are women safe to speak publicly about relations, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, like Mitchell, who studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women were in a position to share these problems clearly; they faced a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstrim, Angela Hatter, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, said that their predecessors had done the opposite.
“In the years 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men had been leaning, and the basis for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,” said Hatter.
There was a need for a white woman to confirm the story in order to substantiate the lynching.
From the point of view of Hatter, the gap between white and black women occurred when white Sufrasists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and found that the struggle for electoral law would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all eggs in the basket for women and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later,” said Hatter.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear picture of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchations at the South Women ' s Association for the Prevention of Lynchations.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, said Mitchell.
From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise in the reactions of white feminists to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation - police behaviour, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to “feed” the problems faced by black women in several generations.
"Would it be great if the activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology were as serious to the right to raise a child as they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.
The feminists of the second wave, who have made careers to fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, now begin to understand what that means.
The famous white gloria Stainim activist of the feminist movement, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and published a sharp article by Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in protests on racism.
“I hope that women who have other but similar reasons to understand the dangers of the body — and the viewpoint on racial issues that are significantly different in public surveys — will be at the head of change,” wrote Stanem.
Although Stanem is charged for the more retreating feminism, which includes both racial and gender issues, her comments on the race in America still surprise some.
A researcher at the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, the author, "Who Stole Feminism?" said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but the Stanim remarches about Ferguson are contrary to the criticism she had previously criticized.
We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small programme, “My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and spanish youths, many feminists, including Gloria Stanem, have followed the anger of many feminists.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that advances the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. border service arrested some 63,000 minors without escort on the southwestern border this year, immigration reform reappeared, this time as a problem for women.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chair We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present this problem as important to women, she had only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of workers are issued to [among immigrants], women who come with them are in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"They have a response from women's organizations," she said.
Ipswich house with pigs is sold.
The picture of a house placed for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it was pictured as a large pig resting in the living room.
Selled for $120,000, a separate house with one bedroom stands on the private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a picture of the living room, where a pig with its head resting on the couch was depicted.
The Real Estate Agency Connelles reported that the pigs in the photograph are the household lover of the owner of the house.
“But the photograph has been posted by error and has already been removed”, the representative of the company reported.
In a detailed description of the house, Connelles described the former assembly house as "a unique home with one bedroom."
Although the agency removed the photograph from its website, it was still kept in advertising materials.
The sale of the house was of interest in social networks, where some asked whether pigs were sold with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharapov, in the fourth U.S. circle, who had retreated by Carolyn Ozniaki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year decently and try to reach a new level, transmits from New York Vasili OSIPOV.
How do you generally evaluate your results on the Big Helmet Tournament this year?
Of course, I'm glad I've won Rolan Harros.
As for three other tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
After all, I couldn't reach a quarterfinal.
What tasks do you have before the end of the season?
After the offended defeat, I have a huge motivation to move to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I'm going to do my best to finish the year worthwhile.
The Asian tournament series begins in a few weeks.
Member of the Committee of the Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Committee, former Champion of Peace, Nikolai Valouev, proposed to give bonuses at tuition.
He said that in general the norm would be the same as in Soviet times, people would give up the standards of prolongation, run and other exercises.
Remember, 12 entities in Russia will begin implementing the GTO rules on their territory as of 1 September.
I also suggested that GTO schoolchildren give bonuses at tuition, noted Valuev.
For example, they can add a little points to EGE.
There are also proposals to provide additional weekends to enterprises that have been tested by sports.
In Harvey town in South Wales, a new millionaire came up after a lottery winner.
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
There is a search for a new millionaire south-west of Perth, where one lucky guy will take home almost $1.1 million from the lottery play on Saturday night.
The Gazette Kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize for the second time in five years, and the previous gain was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a successful winner still needs to declare himself.
The owner of Steve Forward's bench said that the winner caused a jiotage in a small town south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the prize winning last month, noting the completion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the player from Kenning Weyle became one of the five millionaires of August, following a huge $7.5 million winner couple from Belmont just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and reported that the winner had given them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total amount of $85 million.
Minor development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will contribute to the Government ' s integrated plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, and will speak of the promulgator of the Department of Oleg Plujnikov on a round table held in Moscow Road Salon 2014.
The plan has been prepared on behalf of the Government, and one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September and early October, says Plujnikov, the proposed measures for electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gasophobic fuel vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (copy is available in the Statements) is 2014-2017.
The criteria for evaluating electrical and hybrid transport are to be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally sound vehicles.
The Government ' s report, which will describe the tax and customs support measures for electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional credit scheme and concessional leasing will be available by April 2015; and proposals for the reduction of the cost of machines, the promotion of localization and the development of service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, changes are expected to be made to regulations to facilitate the construction of charge infrastructures ( parking, logging and other).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for the regional authorities during 2015 to encourage the use of clean transport, in the form of advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and, by February 2016, proposals for expanding public transportation.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will provide a list of evaluation indicators for regional authorities that reflect the effectiveness of support for clean transport production and the development of charge infrastructure.
The Russian e-mobile market is only being developed - in 2013, about 100 electric vehicles have been sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, an import tax on electric cars has been nullified, so the sales would be about 500 grand, predicting the chief executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any visible: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million light and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
Only Mitsubishi Motors are importing to Russia.
Renault is starting to import -- the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says the Director of Strategic Planning and Renault Partnerships in Russia, Nicolas Remis.
Most of the other electrical transport producers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
The development of electric cars is also available by Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "but the release is small.
For example, in January and July 2014, according to the ASM-Holding data, AutoWAS produced 30 electric vehicles.
The demand for low-cost electric cars, recognizes the director of the AutoWaze for the Engineering of Sergey Amanov, without the prestige of the breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian market for electric vehicles in addition to the roadways of vehicles (their electrical vehicles sold in Russia are, on average, twice as expensive as the internal combustion engines) constrains the unevolving of the charge infrastructure (fuzzle-units), sighing by Sergei Célikov.
Because of the expensive and low cost reductions of electric cars in the next 3-4 years, they will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, projected by Mikhail Travelans' lead editor, and agrees with it.
On the contrary, the autoproducers say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of normal vehicles.
The Russian electricity market has good prospects, the key is to build confidence in consumers that “electromobility” is real; this will, inter alia, contribute to the emergence of all the new BMW stations, stresses the President of the BMW group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Infrastructure projects, such as the Rosseti State: several stations are built in Moscow, and some 80 more will soon be built.
Negotiations on the construction of the supply chain are ongoing with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofine, Director of Rossetas, the company believes in the market for electric cars and is ready to construct gas stations throughout the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and a lack of a single standard for electric charges from different brands.
In addition, Rosseti, as a network company, is not allowed to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so with regard to electrical charges is being developed.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of the primacy of the Russian power market for refunding customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, the expansion of the concessional list is being considered.
The replacement of the transport tax on the environmental (the idea discussed and applied to all cars) would also support the market, but not as tangible as the customs preferences, Pankov considered.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike Norway, where tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in the sale of electric cars - now accounted for 12 per cent of the market.
In Russia, there is a need for incentives for owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as already done in Moscow), to Pankov, or the possibility of moving electric cars on selected strips, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private aircraft crashed in Colorado
One-motor Piper PA-46 crashed in Colorado, U.S. state.
Three out of five people who are in it are dead, transmitting ITAR TASS.
The survivors are taken to the hospital.
An accident occurred several kilometres from the Denver airport offshore.
The causes of the tragedy are now being identified.
In the Donetsk region, the Donbass battalion is dealt with with prisoners.
The carats were surrounded by Iloways.
They were handed over by their own commanders, and dozens of the Forcesmen were killed under shelling.
The survivors say that if they knew what the situation really was in South-East Ukraine, they would not have gone to war.
108 prisoners are happy.
The carats from the Donbas battalion were alive after the meat that they got under Ilovaski.
In the context of the Donetsk People ' s Republic of Army, militiamen conducted several days, which were actually abandoned by their commanders and the Ukrainian authorities.
When it was reported from the headquarters that the ring could be left on the alleged corridor, the convoy moved.
But literally in a few minutes, the shells and bullets hanging on all sides.
"After the information given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out, and the deputy commander of the battalion with the call "Lermont".
And as we descended between the Pollution and the Red Sea to the low, a cross-fire from the anti-tank missiles, the Zuks, the 30-millimetres grenades, the automatic MBD guns, the small arms.
Four cars and three in front of me, leaving only two.
An officer with Lermont's call says that almost immediately there were at least 60 deaths, dozens wounded, and many died afterwards.
The surviving militants are now providing medical assistance to those who have come to kill.
Now prisoners are surprised that so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, and give medication.
While their own commanders deceptively deceived them and condemned them to death.
We've been betrayed simply, they say.
The colon, the battalion to be destroyed.
At the Donbass battalion, like many of his companions, Alexey volunteered because in Ukrainian news, he talked about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east of the Separatists.
Alexey's already seen a very different picture here.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar shooting, which is probably the Ukrainian armed forces, one of the soldiers, Alexay.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We weren't released from Ilowaysk, they said we were on the ring.
I've already agreed with the commander, and the report has already written about the departure.
We were taken from Zurachevo's fees to Ilovaisk immediately.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in "kotle" under Iloway.
Some survivors now admit that if the time could be turned back, they would never have entered the punitive battalion.
All imprisoned militia handed over to the DNR forces.
Each person will be tested for involvement in war crimes.
A food price-limiting headquarters has been established in the region
In the Krasnoyara region, a headquarters has been established to limit the growth of food prices in the region's market, as appropriate.
The decree establishing this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters was composed of members of the Government of the province, executive and oversight bodies.
Together, they will monitor agricultural prices in the province.
Is the Economy going to reimburse the Kiev Rosnefti $140 million?
The head of Rosnefti, Igor Secin, stated that the company was assessing the damage to the Ukrainian NHRI shelling of 140 million Ukrainian dollars.
He reported this in the Spiegel interview.
“We are assessing the damages of $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian Government for compensation”, said Secin.
He said that the implementation of the modernized NHRIs was planned in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no fights, there were no insurgents, but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technology oil that was dumped into the trumpets is missing," he said.
Remember, on 18 July, in connection with the bombing of the Lisican NHRI, the oil storage container was burned and two warehouse buildings were destroyed.
The Lisican NHRI, the main oil-processing factory in Ukraine, was first introduced in October 1976.
The total capacity of Lisican NHRIs is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The factory is capable of producing Euro-4 fuel as well as the dissolved Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisician NHRI was suspended due to its loss.
It was decided to start repairing.
A year later, Rosnefty received the Lisican NHRI along with other Ukrainian TNC-XB assets.
The DPRK launched a small distance shell towards the Japan Sea.
According to the South Korean media, this occurred about 10:30 a.m. by local time from Chagando Province, which is on the North Korean border and China.
As reported by Interfaxu at the Joint Committee of South Korea Staff Chiefs, a missile was allegedly dropped into the Japan Sea after some 220 kilometres of flight.
Roll falls in the background of geopolitical pressure
In the Moscow Exchange, the dollar grew by 3 copies to 37.15 roubles, and the rouble fell to a basket in the background of geopolitical tension.
The ETC dollar deals started by transactions at rubbish 37.11-37.2 roub./$1, on average in two minutes the course is 37.16 roub./$1, which is 4 copies above the previous closure level.
The course of the course was 48.79 roubles per euro, which was 3 copies above the level of the previous closure.
The basket price added 3.5 cops to 42,395 roubles.
The United States dollar is traded by 23 cops above the official course, and the euro by 16 cops above the official course.
The Russian market continued to decline rapidly on Friday, 29 August, but there was no panic this time.
He went on cheap and rubble and even renewed the historical maximum to the dollar.
Investors are already playing advances in deteriorating the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But as long as it's more like an artificial hysterics spilled through the media, especially the Western media.
The options for the introduction of new sanctions to the FM are not so many.
TeleTrade " At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to be severely weakened against the basket basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determinant.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, and Russian indices and national currency positions can be adjusted.
The Orenburg Airlines will be tried with the Ideal tour.
The Orenburg Airlines filed an Ideal tour with a total of 4.7 billion roubles.
These two cases will be held in October.
The cases will be reviewed by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first claim was filed on 14 August.
It's a little over 425 million roubles.
The meeting on it was scheduled for 7 October.
The second statement was submitted on 18 August.
His sum is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting on it was scheduled for 2 October.
According to journalists in the Russian Union, tourist judges have been appointed differently.
In July, the media received information on the Ideal-Tour debts to the Orenburg Airlines in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
Victor Zükin, airman, tells us about 1.6 billion rubles.
Aerophlot's Hector Vitaly Savelev calls an even greater sum, two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to become more interesting to new users
The Twitter microblogs have changed the user registration process to involve new participants more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
The new Twitter users will now look at a large number of read-offs recommended by the accountant at the time of registration to form their own reading circles.
Recommendations are based on the interests specified in the registration process.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets up a subscription checkbox for all the automatically selected accountants.
That's why the user will have to take off the checkers on his own so he won't read those who are not interested in him.
If the users of the microblogging service have seen only the avatars of recommended users before, Twitter now takes out a sample of one of the popular blogger's tweets to help make a impression of the person.
This is the biggest change in Twitter registration in the last three years.
Twitter has recently been active in modernizing the service.
This activity is primarily linked to continuing attempts to achieve promiscuity.
In 2014, the microblogging service experienced a slowdown in the user base and a fall in reader's activity.
At this point, the company desperately needs more loyal consumer resources that will remain for a long time.
That is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The Day of Knowledge in Moscow will be graceful and rainy.
The first September in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, reports by meteorologists.

The rains will pass in clouds and clear the weather, the east quarter wind will be faint, only 3 to 8 meters per second.
Automobile disposal programme resumed as of 1 September
Since 1 September, the automobiles programme has been reinstated in Russia.
By 31 December 2014, 10 billion roubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the Head of the Ministry of Industry, Denis Mantourov, money is allocated from the limits that have already been transferred to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the RF through redeployment from other support areas.
The programme concerns all cars over six years of age.
The amount of compensation would be between 40,000 for a car and 350,000 rubles for the cargo.
Previously, a similar vehicle disposal programme had been in place in Russia.
The Minister explained the main difference between the current project and that it is not only expected to dispose of cars to be refunded, but also the possibility, if the vehicle has reached the age of over six, to acquire a new one with a discount on the transfer of an old one to the “triid-in” at the dealer, transmits “Interfax”.
More than 16 billion roubles were spent in the previous federal recycling programme operating from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of car production in 2010 was about 1.2 million (this plus 101.4 per cent compared to 2009).
The Creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalists
Heymdiziner Nicky Case, a famous Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He told me about his project in Kill Screen interview.
Case began to play a few weeks ago, but the fact was widely known only now.
Events in Ferguson were a source of inspiration, where protests began after a police officer killed an unarmed black adolescent.
In the focus of the project, which is not yet titled, the impact of information about stories will be affected.
The hero of the game, a civil journalist, will have to take photographs of the areas where the police and the population are confronted.
Hero can take a picture of what's happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene so that the police will look like heroes and the protesters are gangsters, the police will be better treated and allowed to go where the ordinary person can't go.
If he does otherwise, his photographs can turn peaceful protests into a massive rebellion.
Eyes in the game will need to be ticketed by a hero where new subscribers will appear if the photographs appear popular.
The game has no title yet.
The date of exit and the platforms on which it appears is unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event can change depending on how the photograph is made and processed.
In an interview, Kill Screen Case explained that he had pondered the concept of such a game a long time ago, but originally wanted to devote it to events in the Gaza Strip, not to the US protests.
After he started collecting the game material, he realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media reporting events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on the basis of what had happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
The most famous project was the Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about Case’s bisexual history, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to explain his relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletium drags Ukraine into the continuation of the bloodshed
The call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims by the Ukrainian Minister of Defence, Valerie Heletey, is provoking the people to continue the bloodshed, as stated in the report of the MID RF.
“In Moscow, of course, they drew attention to the comments made by the head of the Ukrainian military department of Valerie Heletei, who declared “the completion of the operation of the liberation of the east of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the Great Home War, the loss of which would be “tens of thousands”.
The adequacy of the head of the Ukrainian military department, who published the post on his page in Facebook, is a subject for the study of non-military professionals”, says a report by Russian diplomats.
They find it difficult to believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defence of the civilized State.
On his page in Facebook, the Minister of Defence of Ukraine wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened several times on informal channels that if resistance continues, they are willing to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
He stated, however, that “the liberation of the east of Ukraine” had been completed.
Reese Hilton removed all the intimate images of the stars and apologized.
Today, more than 60 stars of Hollywood are terrified.
Hackers hacked the primitive passwords in the iCloud (data storage) in the smartphones, after which their intimate images appeared on the Blogger Rese Hilton website.
It's not for long.
Remember, Jennifer Lawrence, an official of the Star of the Hungry Games, has already reported theft of photographs from her cell phone, and has confirmed that all the images that appear in the Network are genuine.
Re-Hilton, the one-named tabloid site, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues for publishing their frank images, writes The Independent.
No, nobody made me do that.
They didn't contact me with their agents.
And now I'm going to remove the frank photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justis," wrote a blogger in Twitter.
However, all the frank pictures of the stars have already flew around the network.
David Beckham was in a car accident, hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident, fleeing Paparace.
It happened in Los Angeles on the turn at Bulwar Sanset.
The British football player was in the bruise and severity of the right hand muscles.
Beckham got out of the paparazzi's tattoo.
Sliding away from their persecution on a motorcycle, he failed to turn with control and fell, writes TMZ with reference to sources close to a soccer football player.
As a result, Bakhem had been defeated, the muscles of his right hand stretched, and the scratches were scratched.
Tony Stewart is suffering the accident, returning to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little bit more than in the middle of the Atlanta Motor Speedway race.
Stuart hit the wall the second time after his right front tyre broke down on 172 circles, putting an end to his presentation.
Stewart took his car to the garage and then went out without talking to the reporters.
Chad Johnston, the leader of his team, said that 14 team members are upset, but will now focus on the race for the next weekends in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and hopefully we'll get better.
Stuart first hit the wall earlier in the race Sunday night after a clash with Kyle Bush, which required repair on the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty great hope to come to the finish," said Johnston, adding, "It just didn't work."
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart was loaded to the evacuator, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stuart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during the groundway race north of New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he had to win either Atlanta, or the next race in Richmond to take part in the chastisement.
He returned to his work during the investigation of the tragic incident, which resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went to the road to express his displeasure to Stewart during the race.
The law enforcement authorities reported on Friday that the cause of the accident would continue for at least two weeks.
No decision was taken whether Stuart would be charged.
The threefold champion was met with loud voices and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stewart was at the beginning of the race at the beginning of the first 10, reaching the fourth position.
Then, 122 rounds after the restart number Bush.
An 18-woman trajectory departed from the 2-way outlet and hit Stuart by pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart continued, but he's back to position 21.
Sobczak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Gwanetsky in Odessa.
Xenia Sobczak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the television guide did not fail to report in her Instagram.
True, one photograph was very surprised and embarrassed by the worshipers of the couple.
The picture is from Gwanetsky.
"In breakfast Mikhail Mikhalych Jwanetsky Maxim explains what instagrams are:)) #odessa," signed the photo of Xenia Sobczak.
However, there is nothing but cigarettes on the table.
No coffee, no bucket, no oil, and so on...
The couple’s worshippers decided that Xussha was smoking too, and they condemned her for it.
"And cigarettes whose? "Curse kills!", "A kind of cigarette breakfast," "Although on breakfast, and only cigarettes on the table)) ", "Kenya, do you smoke?", aroused their lover's subscribers to her blog.
Remember, recently, Sobczak had been chased by what a tasted dinner had prepared for her for the first time in her life by Maxim Vitorgan.
"Happiness is when you come to a date, and your husband has prepared dinner for your arrival, which is what's good at marriage. Now at the end of dinner, he's not saying from the anecdote, "that's what it is every day," and she's boasted by her husband, Xenia Sobczak.
The picture shows that Maxim's hard to cook, and there's already a salt and baked chicken on the table.
Bulgarian prison officials conducted a national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria conducted a national protest against the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return the previous working conditions that had recently been modified.
Increased salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Acting Minister of Justice Christo Ivanov.
During the month, the officers protested symbolically against the new schedule of work, requiring the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Although the union of prison officials had met repeatedly with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement had been reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations continue, reported by BNR to the Head of the Directorate-General for the Execution of the Penalties of Rosen Jellyvan.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ministry of the Interior staff are expected to protest.
Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Minister of Defence of the Wongswan Council (left)
The military ruler and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prait Chang-Ocha, announced the composition of a new Cabinet of Ministers in which more than one third of the posts were held by generals or generals in resignation.
The military has received key positions: ministers of defence, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prait Chan-Ocha was formally approved as Prime Minister following the formal approval by the King of Thailand of the appointment of a head of the interim military Government to that post.
The 60-year-old military who took power in the country as a result of the unblood coup on 22 May was the only candidate for the Prime Post.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
Earlier, the army appointed parliamentary deputies.
According to Praita Chang-Och, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by a six-month demonstration that required the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinawat.
The official Praima Praima will be a temporary premier, as the military is planning to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there is concern that military forces are trying to strengthen their power in the country.
The military came to power on 22 May
In the background of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were arrested temporarily.
Immediately after the military came to power, they arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglick Chinavat.
Some journalists and public figures were also delayed.
The current political crisis is at the root of 2006, when the army relocated Brother Jinglick Chinavat Tacsin as Prime Minister.
Both enjoy rural popularity, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has made them successful in the elections on several occasions.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital elites entered an anti-governmental movement, which had almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said it'd be better in the Midian salad, I didn't promise you that, joking off the waitress from the new Palm braceser.
It has to be formally recognized that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain unswerving.
Because everybody knows long ago that we're saying "Belgium," we mean Midias, we're saying "midias" -- "Belgium."
Restorators like to say in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are other places that are not good, even great, but unsuccessful.
As soon as I sat down at the table of Palm, I remembered that once there was a town cafeteria (honour the same television), then Odessa Mama, and also a "Godolé" restaurant and a beer "Broochba."
Now there's a beer, but no longer nostalgic-Sowet, but Belgian.
Only the top of the iceberg, a bar steak and a pair of tables, and all the rest of the space is not even a hint of sunlight.
It's fun here, like in a child's room: red, yellow, green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs that swim girls.
Belgian institutions in Petersburg have long been out of the novelty, so there is a comparison with what.
There are eight types of spilled beer (260-300 rubles 0.5 l) and a multitude of bottles (170-1550 roubles).
The company-positive waitress makes a fun presentation of the menu, telling us that "midies are rich seeds," and we should note that it's the service, despite some shortcomings, that's the most positive side of Palm.
Menus are expected for content, but often very unexpectedly.
Who, for example, is given the assumption that the meat roll with the gross blackwood (280 roubles) is actually carpaccio cut so thinly that the parchment paper would appear unimaginably thick compared with it.
It's only when you're warmed together by the semi-tarols.
The salads are even worse.
The classic ice (260) would be the right thing to admit as a crime against the Belgian people: some blasphemy iceberg that has once been ripped off by a potato that has oxidized Kenyan beans, edified chips from the bacon, and why a marinated bow.
You don't want to meet anyone with such a ice salad!
The composition of Belgian salad ingredients was partly different, but the impression was not positive.
If the inexperienced quarters of the tomatoes of the tomatoes or the burned championes could still be closed, why the Midians look like a few times they have been frozen and turned off in their lives!
I already know that there are normal white-market mussels here!
They are placed in the sauce for your choice (490-560 roubles per 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauce, the white wine, the seldery and the carrots, did not stand frankly.
The vegetables are eaten, and the fragrance is missing, and whether the wine was there, it was still a mystery.
But the good Medicine Frito with the Mayones.
The chicken vaterse here is not a burrow so thick that depending on your mood, you can decide, the first or second dish is in front of you, but just a nice plumage soup.
The rabbit was said to be cooked in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about the Rosemary.
At the turn, the situation was diameterally opposite: the looming was silenced by everything.
It seemed that this rabbit had been feeding exclusively the rosemary shrubs, and the meat had become so fragrant.
But at the same time, the rabbit's knife was adjacent -- no, no, just the retractable pear in a caramelized short.
Waffles in the Palm are offered not only sweet but also salty with beef, chicken or bacon (220-280).
The clay sauce was an excess waterman, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in lunch impressions.
So we should come again.
The dollar has risen to more than 37 roubles in news of new Western sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar was estimated to be 26.9 roubles by tomorrow by 10:29 and was 37.02 roubles, and the euro was raised by 30 copies, up to 48.73 roubles, showing the Moscow Exchange data.
The basket grew by 28 coppers to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Prior to the criminal events, the dollar reached the maximum of 19 February 2009, at that time it cost 36.43 rubles, and on 3 March 2014 it was rouble 37.005 roubles.
On the night of 29 August, the White House reported that Barak Obama and German Chancellor Angel Mercel discussed the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
Reducing the ruble is long-term, coupled with the euro and coupled with the dollar.
The long-term projection was foreshadowed by this mark, says Anna Bodrova's senior analyst "Alpary."
Everything that's connected to Ukraine will be reflected in courses in one way or another.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, rumours about military incursions have not been confirmed on the one hand, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the conversations about his resistance to those news were overheard yesterday.
A specialist projected week will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 roubles per dollar.
The tax period ended, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the transit of gas across Ukraine, all of which are links of one chain.
Inflation is also projected, with 5 to 10 per cent added to current autumn prices.
In addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will soon end, and a vacuum will come as the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the 37 roubles mark, went and returned, some powerful hysterics not," commented the head of the Market Analysis Division of the Broker Opening of Constant Bushhuev.
They will still see whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday as NATO meets.
He said that Rubl had been severely weakened since the end of the tax season, and then news had been sent to Ukraine, and the CB had stated last week that by the end of the year it was going to take a full turn and refused any monetary intervention.
Looking at daytime fluctuations, it was nothing different from the previous month, everyone was scared by a 37 roubles mark, continues to be an analyst.
Well, nothing powerful has happened in terms of circulation.
An alarming time for the currency market was remembered when, at the end of January, the demand for currencies and the third of March, when the CB had shipped the record amount of the currency.
FAT IC also sees a positive side of the deterioration of the rouble.
First of all, this is an increase in the export budget income, as well as in the competitiveness of domestic producers through imports, says the main FAT IC Alexei Kozlov analyst.
The travel of import goods and services may be considered negative.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, increase inflationary pressures and, as a result, lead to the increased borrowing of money, which in turn hinders the development of the country's economy.
In terms of the share market, the depreciation of the rouble has slightly reduced the reduction of share prices expressed in the roubles.
For example, the IMB index fell by 1.67 per cent during the bidding process on Thursday, while the RTA index lost 3.27 per cent.
The significant difference in the relative reduction of indices is due to the lowering of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5 per cent.
Rupe deterioration is emotional and is due to the massive desire to buy currency.
The practice suggests that emotions are gradually declining and that the rubles are partially or completely restored to the lost positions.
"I believe we will soon be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency close to 36 roubles per dollar," notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic infringement is often misdiagnosed
British reported that she had spent many years thinking she'd die after an improper diagnosis.
Carin Rogers spent most of her teenage age, thinking she had only a few years of life after she had diagnosed another disease.
In fact, she had Sharco-Marie-Tuta (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders, which result in nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The CMT UK charitable organization reported that the wrong diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because it's so little known about this condition.
About 23,000 people in Britain are expected to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unscrupulous walk and clutched fingers.
The sufferers may feel overwhelmed or pain, and the condition does not heal and progress, which means that the symptoms are increasing over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from the Fredreich attack, a state for which the prediction was very bad.
Rogers thought she'd be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18 and would die before she turned 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, said, "I knew as a child I couldn't do what others did.
I was falling every day, and I had more time.
I could never ride on rolls or skateboards with other kids, and I had a lot of bullying at school because I was walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to free achilles and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical map when her doctor left the room, and it was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I put my nose down, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and felt the worst panic I could ever do.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I'm 25, and that I'll gradually lose all my ability in this space.
I went through it alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up and embraced me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you'd have that disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much less threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, she found CMT.
"When he explained what the CMT was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket," she said.
The British CMT charity announced a month of information on CMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
Tax burden on Washington Zone entrepreneurs increases as the economy recovers
The recovery economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
State and local tax accounts for companies throughout the country have increased moderately in the past year when economic recovery has accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the company in the Washington Zone is no exception.
The company in the district, Maryland and Virginia aggregately paid $27.6 billion to the state and local level in 2013, an increase of 3.8 per cent over the total of 26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The state and local business tax burden in the past year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after one another, when the accounts were reduced, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased faster, 4.3 per cent, than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to a study by a professional service provider, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Unit.
More than half of the district tax revenue, 56 per cent, is taxed by entrepreneurs, while 36 per cent of Maryland's tax revenue is for firms.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces the lowest tax revenue, proportionately from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenue is due to the continued return to the value of the firms, researchers say that the real estate tax has increased by 3.7 per cent this year, after three consecutive years, when the increase was less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these incomes are made up of large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is true in the Washington Zone.
The company in the district, Maryland and Virginia aggregately paid $10 billion for real estate taxes at the state and local level last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent than in the previous year.
However, the observed return of real estate value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes are barely higher than one fifth of the company ' s tax accounts.
The Virginia and the Colombian County are paying about half of the State and Local Tax Accounts in the form of real estate taxes.
“What happens in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially the tax base around the Columbia County, belongs either to the Government or to a non-profit organization that does not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Tax Centre.
Thus, Maryland has to rely much more on income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the restoration of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurial income also appears to be corrected according to these data.
Companies in the region have pledged a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, a $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate income from the income tax, most in the region.
While trends are in the same direction, local entrepreneurs' tax burdens are not increasing at the same speed in all three locations.
The growth rate in the district of Colombia was at the same level as the average for the country, 4.3 per cent, while the growth in Maryland was substantially faster, 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues were rising below the average, at 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, there was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (equivalent to each corporate rate) of 6 per cent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the district it is relatively high - 9.975 per cent.
A similar study of the United States Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia, taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and generally a more favourable climate with regard to taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The study was not evaluated.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is competing with a neighbour from the south.
North Carolina has recently signed legislation that reduces the corporate rate this year from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate falls to 5 per cent next year.
If the State continues to achieve the tax goals next year, this law could lead to a rate of income tax for entrepreneurs even 3 per cent by 2017.
Meanwhile, the small business in the Washington Zone seems to feel better and thus pays more taxes in the state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs payable as individual income taxes to small business owners - a transition structure where most small firms - in the district of Colombia, Maryland and Virginia - have increased by 20 per cent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than those for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in revenues from business taxes throughout the country are likely to continue this year, with taxes from the state and local governments that have risen by 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind, as the reduction of federal expenditures affects the labour market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The world championship on the judo brought two silver and seven bronze awards to Russia.
Only the main favorite of Japan’s competing competitions have the Russians compromised according to this figure.
The tournament in Chelabinsk started on Monday, and the first day, the Russian team brought the silver medal.
She was the owner of Beslan Wythan, who was a category of up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the final fight against Baldbaatar Ganbat of Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was only one comment received by the Russian man.
And then, on the second day, the tournament became the most successful for the assembly of Russia -- on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In male competitions, up to 66 kg of silver reached Mikhail Puleev and Bronza Kamalah Khan Magomedov.
In the final week, the Russian surrendered the 2011 and 2013 champion of peace to Masassi Ebinume.
Han-Magomedov, who lost his fellow countryman at the fourth stage, won a comforting tournament and became a bronze rewarder.
Natalia Kuzutina also reached the third stage of the Pedestal tournament of the category of women.
In semi-final she lost the current Kelmendi Kosovo championship of the International Judo Federation and successfully protected the title.
In a bronze dispute, Kuzutin won Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that the third place was not what she expected.
Again, Kelmendi was a barrier to Russia’s gold, winning Kuzutin earlier in the finale of the European championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelabinsk, Bronze was placed in a collection of Russians by Musa Machachov, who fought under the category of 73 kg.
In fourth, his offender became the former representative of Moldova, Victor Skovorts, who is now in charge of the OAU team.
However, thereafter, the Russian won two fights and became a rewarder.
The mighty spoke at the home championship with the trauma of the hotel, which he plans to heal soon, so he'll take a pause in the competition.
As for the ex-Maldovanine Squortsov, he and he got to the bronze medal on this tournament.
Interestingly, the other member of his country, who accepted the AEA sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko and his bronze had completed the class to 100 kg.
The fourth day of PM-2014 also brought to the Russians one bronze, which, in category up to 81 kg, had won Ivan Nifont.
In a heavy battle of the small final, he won French Alan Schmitt by commenting from the rival.
On Friday, three sets of prizes were picked on the tournament, but the Russians traditionally restricted one bronze in a male tournament to 90 kg.
Cyril of Questions became its owner, and this medal assembled by Russia was guaranteed by his competitor for the comfortingfinal of Cyril Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival of the Questionnaire was unable to go to my dads because of the injury.
The man's bronze was conquered by the owners and on the sixth day of the competition, she was placed in a coup d ' état by Renat Saidov, who was more than 100 kg.
In the comforting finale, he gained a pure victory over the Brazilian man David Moura.
This ends the individual part of the world ' s primaryity.
On the last day of the tournament in Chellabinsk on Sunday, the world's champions were played in team competitions.
Both Russian - both male and female - were one of the main claims for the awards, but as in individual competitions, the representatives of the beautiful sex were not fortunate - they didn't reach the medal.
The Russian judoists have conquered the command silver.
In a decisive fight against the 2-3 account, they retracted the main favourites of the Japanese team.
At the same time, the Russian assembly led 2-0 after the pure victory of Khan-Magomedov and the voyage - Denis Yartsev (up to 73 kg).
However, in more heavier categories, it was not possible for Japanese rivals to deal with Murat Habatirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Asen Cambiev (100).
A bronze match in a woman's tournament was also developed, where the Russian prefabricated, leading 2-0, retracted to Japan - 2-3.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the team competition in Chellabinsk, who, after the tournament, congratulated the male silver assembly.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could be championships," said Putin, whose words are brought by RIA "Nowths."
To the Japanese, the judo ancestors, there's nothing starved about here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
Russia's collection at the world's home championship was much better than a year ago at a similar level in Rio de Janeiro.
The Russian team then had only three medals -- one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament had missed the Olympic Champions of Arsen Galstan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person enters the Olympic Cycle in eight strongest, he's a potential winner of Olympics.
The more sports like judo," the Tournament Minister of Sport, Vitaly Mutoko, quoted as the championship press.
Japan ' s gathering was expected to be the best in Chelabinsk, gaining 11 medals of different dignity, five of which were golden.
The next world champion will be held in the summer of the next year in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers was unconscious of coming to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope today that an 81-year-old comedy actress would recover from the disease.
"Thank you for your constant love and support," said Melissa Rivers in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a heart stop in the Horse East Island clinic, Yorkville Endoscopy, reports sources.
The doctors deliberately hold her under the drug and under strict surveillance until she is satisfied with her condition, which remains “critical”.
The response was broad, including numerous Internet support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everybody can do the kings.
In the sale of the Royal Blood Group's debut album, a new hope for British rock rock dweth from clubs to stadiums.
The doet Royal Blood has been on the stage for a year, but it already has an act of nomination for the BBC music prize, a tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert on Jimmy Payj himself.
Their debate one-name album was awarded 100,000 prejudgements a few months before the Relys, and the contract for his release is in the Warner Music portfolio of the Majorлейbla.
In view of the current sad situation in the music market, the situation from a number of standstills is not the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet voice to the “new R'n'B” representative, but the duet of British whipped with the volume and intensity that was last used a couple of decades ago.
In general, the first album rates for all the aforementioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been justified.
Doumes would have taken a name that could have been attacked before, except for the very frustrated hairy metalists, and the blood of which the kings flows, as they seem to have in their veins, is also understandable.
This is, of course, particularly about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, the Royal Blood is designed to burst up the stagnant blood of the British rock by bringing it to a new height.
Forecasts of the success of this enterprise are still probably early, but something can be argued already.
Ten of the songs that were set up in thirty and a little minutes are not as much a demonstration of phenomenal compositorial gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: let's say the "Out of the Black" is characteristic of what is remembered, not by the tune line, but by the drum party.
Musicians jest to say that this song is easier to knock than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing plate of "Better Strangers" with the Shakespeare quote in the title.
The truth, however, is that each of these songs will sound well at a party of heavy rock advertising, but when playing in a consecutive time, they are plunged into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that doesn't necessarily have to be bad, even the opposite.
The power of the Royal Blood is that they do not claim to be the laurers of the new Lennon and McCartney (who will soon be sweeping Motörhead successors), but have taken many rock doets out of the ghetto indi clubs.
Their music, notwithstanding some diversity, was created for stadiums, in a room designed for fewer than a couple of thousands of people, evidently close to it.
The secret is partly in the cunning use of the bass that replaced the guitar in the usual format created at the beginning of the zero White Stripes.
It's not only about tools, it's about the way they're writing songs.
The guards of the zero-stroke retroke were hard to pick out beyond the postmodern paradigm, reluctantly reluctantly seeking to admit themselves not just to epigons, but to be self-sufficient creative units.
The Royal Blood now sounds so powerful and nasty that it is a success in draping some secondaryity and steadyness of musical material.
And finally, who said the rock should be smart?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON has just confirmed what the information reported on Friday morning: Online and video producer, and a hundred other things are buying a Twitch stream video service for $1.04 billion (US970 million).
This news was not a surprise because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, Google's Twitch video service for a good billion looked completely ready, and it seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a common stream service - a YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where geymers broadcast their intraplaying moments; "YouTube for real-time games," says Business Insider.
Interfice Twitch.
And the "let's play", the video genre, in which all-knowers give (mainly old) games processing like the "Tasin Theater" is already popular on YouTube.
The case is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch is described, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met without special interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that it was reported that he was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have right now is this statement from Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shire, "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me who say they're better going to sport than watching it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking into their hands the joysticks.
One thing is to watch a friend's shoulder at 3 p.m. when she crawls through the Resident Evil, and it's quite another to watch a stranger gets 20 shots in the head in a row at Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so to watch them, without controlling the angle of their own eyes, can be a recipe for the headache worth doing it right.
I agree that the fast passages in which Rogers Bennesteres of our e-century end all the games in record dates are having fun.
But if it's not about play or humor, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel would be interesting.
But what do sceptics know like me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon work for this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch is going to go to Amazon Instant Video just as elegant as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would enjoy: a crowd of young men about whom advertisers dream.
As chapter Twitch Shire, Amazon and Twitch said "boys believe in the future of games," and this channel does not show signs of draining, even oh, like a spectacular sport.
More than 330 people, including 186 children, died as a result of the 2004 terrorist attack.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
Talked to the surviving hostages, most of the students, with the parents of the dead, with the cemetery watcher of the Angels, Ramon Caspolatov, head of the Committee of Susana Dudiev, who took part in a special operation by a member of the MSA, relates to Elizabeth Antonov, a reporter of the Community, working on the special project.
Upon returning to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslahannov, who had been Presidential Adviser for the Northern Caucasus 10 years ago, and had negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the Russian FSB officer Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during my work on this topic was that in Beslan it was as if there weren't those ten years.
This is an extremely painful topic for all who have any regard for it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
Impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done our job," said Antonov.
A special project has been prepared by the cholding Rambler & Co study, which has been working with a company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to World War I and Vladimir Putin's 15th anniversary to power.
DPRK launched a small-range missile
North Korea launched a small distance missile in the Japanese sea, reports Renghap.
The launch was made about 10:30 a.m. by local time from Chagando Province on the North Korean border and China.
The missile was likely to fall into the Japan Sea, flying some 220 kilometres, and was declared at the Joint Committee of South Korea Chiefs of Staff.
Deputies proposed that the entry into force of the Personal Data Act be expedited
In the event of the success of the initiative, data from Russians will not be stored on servers abroad as of 1 January 2015
A draft law has been introduced to the Office to transfer the date of entry into force of the already enacted Russian Personal Data Act from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative framework of the lower Chamber.
It was sponsored by the Deputies of the Lord Vadim Géngine, Jaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Eugenius Fedorov ("Single Russia"), Vladimir Parajin (Jewitz Russia) and Alexander Yushenko (CRC).
This change, in the view of the sponsors of the initiative, will contribute to the more rapid and effective protection of the rights of citizens of the RF for the preservation of personal data and to the secrecy of correspondence in the information and communication networks.
The law in force by which parliamentarians are hurried obliges the RF to keep the personal data of Russians processed via the Internet.
It also makes the recording, systematization, stockpiling, storage, refinement and extraction of personal data from citizens of the RF, in databases located in Russia, and the location of such databases.
In addition, the law empowers Roskomondor to limit access to information processed in violation of RF legislation in the field of personal data by a court decision.
The Act also proposes the creation of so-called black lists of violators ' websites - an automated information system entitled “Receipt of the rights of personal data actors”.
This law was adopted by the Lord in summer.
The Bill was sponsored by Andrey Lugova and Vadim Génguin from LDPR and Alexander Yuschenko from CRC.
Money and Yuschenko are also one of the sponsors of the current bill on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law already adopted.
Those who don't have the RF-centre dates will have to pay for rental.
Commenting today on the draft draft law of the Duma Committee on Information Policy, Leonid Levin stated that he did not see problems in the transfer of the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that those companies that would not have their own personal data warehouses in the Russian territory by 1 January 2015 would be able to rent them, such as “Rostekoma”, who repeatedly said that they were willing to lease their servers and already provided their servers, Mail Group, to Western companies that now provide their servers.”
“There are also several independent date-centres ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
“If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the RF, I do not see problems, they will be able to obtain technological accommodation”, Levin summarized.
Fraud Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services if the bill was adopted.
In particular, these include online air tickets and hotels.
In the view of the association, “the legal project deprives persons of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to control their own data in a peremptory manner, determining that their recording, systematization, etc., should be provided only in databases located in the Russian Federation”.
The RAEC statement stresses that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user information mechanism on the location of the recording, the systematization of its personal data.
In such a case, it would be possible to choose which territory the actions would be carried out.
The adoption of such "localization" laws on personal data in other countries has led to global services and significant economic losses.
A participant in the test of the ice water bear raised the jaw
Isabel Roberts, from Britain, screamed so much when her head was poured out with icewater that it damaged the body’s bone structure.
The test of the icewater bear went wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during the test of the ice - water bear that she raised her jaw.
Isabel Roberts shouted so violently when her head was poured out with ice water that her face was damaged.
"The water was so cold that I shouted, but when I did it, my jaw began to stuck," she said to the Mirror.
The water is coming for a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts a second before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but he didn't shut up, he got stuck, and then I came to realize that something was wrong.
At that time, my mother and my sister came to the same understanding, and they began to laugh, but I had to go to the emergency office urgently.
A 20-year-old woman from Britain was taken to a hospital to exercise her jaw after taking part in popular engagement on Tuesday.
Clip has become an online exposure and has been published thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militias handed over more than 400 prisoners to Ukrainian military
In the Army of Novorossia, it is alleged that the Ukrainian Su-27 was killed and that the enemy was accused of violating the ceasefire agreement
As at 10:00 on 1 September, the militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax, a representative of the Press Service of the Army of Novorossia.
He added that “a Su-27 aircraft that violated ceasefire agreements were shot off by the ERW forces in the area of Mereška.”
According to an agency interlocutor, the Ukrainian side of the shelling of the merchandise airport of the Lhuban Airport used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The press representative noted that the militia had succeeded in harming two Ukrainian military helicopters in one of the field airfields and in destroying two armoured personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses during the night.
“The loss of the opponent's life - up to a hundred people killed and wounded - surrendered to 13 people,” summed up the headquarters representative.
Interfax does not have evidence of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed groups of the “national republics”, Donbassa, announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side under the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DNR Army, according to “Army of Novorossia”, “repressed the attempt by the Nazis, in violation of earlier agreements, to remove heavy equipment from the area of the environment”.
The militias then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in the short run, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 troops.
According to the headquarters, total opponents ' losses in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansky, Marioupolsk) during that night amounted to five tanks, eight armoured combat vehicles, over 120 killed and wounded
At the end of the past week, a major Ukrainian troop group was surrounded by militia in the Ilovaisk region in the Donetsk region.
President Vladimir Putin of Russia asked the leadership of the "National Republics" to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
The DNR agreed to do so subject to the surrender of weapons and munitions by an opponents.
The first tens of soldiers began leaving the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence battalion, “Donbas” Simeenchenko, 14 more came out of the “cotla” on the night of the Sunday.
In his Facebook, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are “in captivity of 137 police 32 RF and 9 RF tanks, where they are treated well.
In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Minorities have refuted reports from Ukrainian military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
MID RF: Russia will respond to new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to respond to its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports the MID RF.
The Russian Foreign Diplomatic Authority reported that the “conclusions” of the European Council of 30 August had demonstrated the inability of EU member countries to overcome the inertia of their unseen support to the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on “absolutely unproved allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of that country”, is referred to on the website of the department.
The MID RF regrets that it is inconsistent with the interests of its member States that are influenced by countries that are interested in increasing confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Union should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine and provide conditions for a full “dialog between the opposing parties”, stressing the department.
The agency also notes that there are now no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbassa, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has been launched, and the number of casualties among the civilian population is increasing.
Recall that specific proposals on RF sanctions are planned for the next seven days in the European Union.
At the same time, EU representatives cooperate closely with American officials.
It is envisaged that they will correlate the initiating measures for the period of operation and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions may affect energy and the financial sector.
The Australian Government has also announced an increase in the sanctions imposed on Russia in the areas of defence, finance and petroleum gas industry.
Clean ways to save university textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to a second course, has come up with a tricky way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to take books to the top of the class, offering them nominal compensation to defer their sales.
"My mathematical analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I received at a semester for $10 and chick-fil-A liver," says Schroeder, 19 years old, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The necessary literature on last semester would cost $430, says he.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and training supplies, but there are a number of options for reducing these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing internet stores and creative ideas like Schröder's system.
The rolling of books is becoming more popular by allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often costs much cheaper than their purchase.
Nibo Incorporate, owned by more than 250 university bookstore, reports that the volume of books has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were taken in the last spring semester, says the Vice President Nebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstore, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here's an introduction course on the best way to make a profitable deal.
Internet shopping
Sometimes, if you go online, the price for a new book can be one third of what you'll see in the university book store.
The ninth edition of the Mathematical Analysis, Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostenler, stands for about $290 on the preiscourt, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on the Chegg.com website, which specializes in the sale of textbooks.
Purchase of the used
If you're not against the marks or damages, used textbooks are a good option.
The mathematical analysis is sold for $93.49 as used on Chegg.com.
Matt Casseday, 25 years old, a fourth course student at the University of Brigham Young, said that he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second copy of the textbook “Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising Business”.
The book was sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Braycy, director of the College Without Walls University of Massachusetts in Emherst, invite students to clarify to their professors whether the previous publications could not be used.
Sometimes updates are non-existent.
In such cases, old editions are often found at a very small share of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc, is a popular alternative to buying old books.
Rate
To take the textbooks, you should think if you're good enough to deal with them, don't forget to get them back, and you don't want to leave them after the course is finished.
You can save more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student was able to take the mathematical analysis on a semester for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you are taking books, including any fines that you may have received for the markings, stresses, and damages.
If you take the book overwhelmed, remember that if you do not return the book, fines may even exceed the value of a new copy.
Electronic Books
Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books take over by obtaining an electronic license for a period of time from distributions such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The mathematical analysis on the Chegg.com website will cost about $61 for six months.
Bracy says that students studying literature can often find the most advantageous prices, because many classical works can now be downloaded free of charge, whereas natural and engineering literature can be very expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Golt, 29 years old, who's going to start the Pepperdin Law School, recommends using ISBN to find out the price of the book because it guarantees that you're looking for the text you need.
Before making an internet order, says Golt, you need to check if the book really is on the warehouse.
It was not easy for him to learn.
The delivery of the book he had acquired was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price in the university book store.
Putin stated the full inefficiency of the Far East Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, convened a meeting on the primacy of priority investment projects and territories in the Far East, said that the budget investment for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, was ineffective, reported by Interfax.
"15 billion roubles are still on deposits," stressed the President.
During the meeting, the Head of State mandated the expedition of the list of Territories ahead of development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the establishment of TRADE should be introduced to the Lord in the autumn.
The Federal Assembly, noted by the President, has not approved the list of the Territories ahead of development in the Far East and their criteria by 1 July.
Vladimir Putin has also formulated key challenges for the development of the Far East.
Among them, the region's accessibility to transport, the lifting of infrastructure constraints, both in the domestic market and export development.
Among other things, there was a need to create preconditions for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as for developing the areas of ahead of development, which should become competitive towards the key business centres of ATP, the President stressed.
Remember, it was previously reported that the territory of advance development could be replaced by HE.
Why "Galax Tradings" couldn't save cash collections
"Silvestra Stalonee's unsuccessful 3 returned less than $30 million of their $90 million budget in the United States, while "The City of Sin: The woman for which to kill" returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
The home video with Cameron Diaz only brought $14.6 million to the first weekend, while child films like "How to Took the Dragon 2" also disappointed with the benefit.
The article of the Telegraph Critic, Robbie Collin, indicates that when it comes to child films, it may be in the poor quality of the film itself.
Collin described 2014 as the worst year in history for child films, and called it "How to Took the Dragon Two Almost "functional" the continuation of the fentesi.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older age, it appears that the problem is not necessarily a film itself.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in summer by at least 2,000 copies between May and 20 July, 2013 and this year.
Results that take into account the views of both the film viewers and the movie critics suggest that the crop of films this year is similar to that of last year ' s cyclists.
Some commentators suggest that the case may be in changing audience habits and growing popularity of web services such as Netflix.
Registrar John Favro, who is currently working on a leaking dysneev film called the Jungle Book, said to the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing."
We must recognize this and not try to pursue what was before.
Unlike the current fall in Hollywood, the Netflix revenue from the stream service reached $1.2 billion, almost twice the last figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Stephen Spilberg criticized the studio for relying too much on the franchises of comic books, and predicted Hollywood's "drag".
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy predictions were part of the truth.
In the summer of 2015, several potential cash-heats, including “Mestals: Altron Era”, “Mignonov” and “Jurish Park”, are expected to be released, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg, a producer of "Lodday H" recently called the fall of cash collections "cyclical," said Hollywood Reporter, "The next summer will be the most cash year in history, and no one will worry about it."
Productive sanctions do not frighten the owners of the establishments with the Caucasian and Mid-Asian food, but for restaurants in Europe and Japan, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, the common drink still prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“There's a little cucumber better than a bad mozarella”, the chef of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Mariano Valerio is crushed on the quality of raw materials offered by the suppliers in return to the Italians.
Mozarella and the cheese of the burrat ended in the restaurant first, with little storage time.
The ferry stores have to be enough for a few months.
What do you do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Doromilov market.
Mariana Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear that shocking memories do not let him go.
The meat was only 30 cm from the floor!
There's cats in there!
Rats!
Then I said, for our restaurant, we'll never buy anything in Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed right now.
But the other day, I was brought to a fish trial from the Far East.
That's how she turned out to be dead!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the man that brought it to us.
Valerio’s surprise is that many of Italy’s common things are for a Russian producer in a wildlife.
A few years ago, I had to buy a Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hanged in a refrigeration cell for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang away to become soft so that the muscles will relax.
I did it with the local beef.
Then they asked me, where did you get that tender meat?
I said, "This is yours, Russian."
Why aren't you doing that?
Five minutes of walking from Barlotti in the French Brasserie Most restaurant in the kitchen, a stop-leaf, indicating missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The Chief of the Brasserie Most Regis Triguel restaurant is not as pessimistic as Valerio: the oysters from France have already replaced the oysters from Tunisia, and the French cheese restaurant will buy Swiss instead.
And Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers, "Blood Cabbage is 200 roubles!
I'm asking, "Why is it so much worth?"
They say, "Well, we have to make a living, too."
But this cabbage shouldn't cost more than 80 roubles!
The far-east oysters we buy by weight, but they live for 15-20 years, imagine how much weight their oyster weighs?
At the price, it turns out it's a superdelicate.
Russian suppliers seem to be one of the main sources of frights for foreign cooks.
The typical story is, "The first three months everything was fine, then the quality fell sharply."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable calibration and quality.
Many European kitchen restaurants don't know what's going to happen when the cheese supplies are over.

The Authorization Menu
On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed an order to apply certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly referred to as food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and subproduct from domestic birds, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cucumber, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, colbases and sugar syrups.
The restaurants began with suppliers: prices for food grew, and analogies from other countries urgently needed to be found.
This will have a stronger impact on the expensive restaurants with a monocushion of France, Italy, Spain, where the products were delivered directly from the “maternal” countries.
The general had to be rebuilt before.
For example, in early 2014, when Rossellhodzor banned the import of Australian beef and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer-2014 were much more serious.
True, on 20 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved the amendments to the presidential decree, which resulted in the ban on Atlantic salmon and troils, non-Lactose milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and seed bow.
Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions may still be mitigated.
So far, part of the restaurants exist in uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoreCa, the share of imports in the premium was up to 70 per cent.
"Dear restaurants will have to change the menus that local farmers and other countries produce, says Sergei Mironov, the Restorator, the owner of the Restconsalt Agency.
If the chef's strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we have very few cooks like this, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
Triguel from Brasserie Most's restaurant is ready to give up 10 to 15 percent of the dish, another half of the menu is to rework.
In a mixed kitchen restaurant, dishes, such as marble beef, are already being replaced, says Sergei Mironov.
“Syres from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian raw materials, raw materials from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, by the representative of East-West Oksana Glibchuk.
Plums and dairy products from Europe have similarities in Russia and Belarus.
The U.S. chicken can be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway, salmon, seed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits in Europe can be offset by domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In the opinion of Mironov, the budgeting of online restaurants would be easier to rebuild than the primal segment: it was unlikely that Gurmans would go there to distinguish Italian mozarella from Russian.
Although it's hard to have Ginza Project institutions, he thinks.
Ginza Project has a few dozen restaurants under different brands and menus.
"They will be replaced by a lot of time," says Mirons.
In Ginza, the commentary was rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
Coffee owners of the Caucasian and Mid-Asian kitchen stress that products from former Soviet republics are more fragile than European
But there are many restaurants that the sanctions will not touch.
These include institutions from the CIS kitchen: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There is no expensive food in the Georgian kitchen," says Hatun Kolbaya, the owner of the Georgian Saperavi restaurant and the "Way Mee!" cafe.
All the raw materials are made for us in Russia, based on many dishes, chicken filament, we're not using exotic greens."
No food was removed from the menu in the Kolbayi institutions.
Timura Lannski, owner of the Chichon N1 restaurants with Uzbek kitchens, is not embarrassed by the penalties that he will only have to change the lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
CIS can be cheaper to obtain cuts, lambs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruits.
But what they bring from Middle Asia is much better than the "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Uzbek tomatoes all know they're delicious, sweet.
Nobody speaks that way about Spanish.
Following the imposition of sanctions, the representative of Minselvodhoz of Uzbekistan, Olymbo Articov, stated that he planned to increase the export of fruitful products to Russia by halving by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan had announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fastfud reservoirs who responded to the request of “Deneg” are also quite calmly responding to the sanctions.
The McDonald's Press Service stated that localization exceeded 85 per cent and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Providers Department, the network purchases about 80 per cent of its products in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products produced from imported raw materials.
In the Terrem, “sanction products” were not more than 4 per cent.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Wocker paws.
KFC, Burger King and Broshka Cardosh had not answered at the request, but other market participants claimed that Burger King's localization rate was significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the Restorators are willing to buy Chilean more than the Russian Far East
On his humpback
In the meantime, the Restorators complain that the demand increases in prices even on local products.
"The products for Grabley grew by an average of 10 to 15 per cent, for Cherri Mio, Italian Restaurant, twice," says Restor Roman Rogernikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of the dish will rise by 5-10%, admits Colbaya.
The East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have traveled 10 to 15 per cent from the beginning of August."
“Brazil suppliers have raised pig prices almost twice,” complains Sergei Rak, Deputy Director-General, Stardogs.
The chicken hammer traveled 35%.
We wait for China's prices, maybe they'll cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned 8 per cent increase in prices.
Now it's very undesirable to raise prices, says Rac.
According to statistics, the increase in common-drink benefit in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest since 2010.
The retail prices will continue to grow, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly, as long as the majority of the Restorators are stockpiled with products for the next two months, hoping to wait for the transfers of the purchase prices.
But what's going to happen in two months is no one knows.
In the area ahead of Moscow’s mayor, there are ten shoes decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the scene, the musicians play the waltz.
It's a festival of regional products called "Eat Time."
"We've been going to do the local food holiday for a long time, and here's the sanctions, we're hurried, we organized the festival," says one of the organizers.
In front of the stage with the musicians, Greek Anastas was preparing a macarot salad and home candy, and the day was a championship class with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, organizers are guaranteed.
In the tent is the exhibition of the achievements of the Russian People's Household.
Med from Bashkyriya, reindeer from Salehard, garbage from Lenin's mosquito Cosmos, cheese from twisted Italian Jean Cloise.
"The fish for restaurants can be quietly replaced by another fish of salmon from the Far East," says Philip Halkin, the owner of the "Our People's Fish Stock."
We've got slums, cats, keaters, humpbacks, chicks, "King salmon."
Yeah, they're not as fat as a Norwegian salmon because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.
You take him in your hand, he won't even move.
And you can't hold our far-east salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozarella of the domestic
The shrimps with the Magadan burrow, the crack, the Omal, the muxun, the Mids from Krym, the Far East.
Halkin is sure it's time to move to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, Russian fishing in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, and a large proportion of fish is diverted to Japan, Korea, and even the United States.
Importing fish in 2013 is about 800,000 tons.
The "Our People" poster has been working since 2012, selling fish through the internet store, before sanctions were imposed, served another and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Perfect Things."
Now 15 more restaurants have been applied to Halkin.
The same land can be made of our fish, it's hot.
We're frozen, we've tried different recipes.
We're selling a million roubles a month via the internet.
Our fish is cheaper a few times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 roubles per kilogram.
In support of the Halkin's tent, I've got Philadelphia with a ket.
Unlike rolls and seeds, these have to chew longer, but the consciousness that this fish is ours, the domestic fish, gives strength.
There are even rolls from the piltus and the seafood on the "People of Mans" website.
The Norwegian salmon is preferable in the land bars.
Halkin explains that the cooks of the lakes can come up with new recipes with the Far East fish.
"Russian fishermen have not yet offered us," explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Euseev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take on a liberation niche, but that is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the Lavka Lavka Boris Akimov project, imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America could now be replaced more quickly.
There are large transnational corporations with strong logistics and heavy volumes.
They are able to place banned imports quickly, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will be won by the large producers of other countries in particular," says Akimov.
In fact, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal in the last month than food sanctions.
As a result of the Rosneutral Surveillance Surveys, three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were suspended.
“We are examining the essence of the claims submitted to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors”, stated “Denham” in the McDonald's press office.
No one really knows what's going to happen.
If all are limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says anonymously, by a restaurant consulting company officer.
If they start closing McDonald's across the country, the scenario will be different.
"Europrotocol" instead of the HYBDD certificate
Casco payments could be received without the HYBDD certificate - so the CB intends to stimulate the introduction of the Europrotocol in Russia.
The Russian Bank has developed a draft directive according to which, as of 1 September this year, an insured motorist will be able to pay fees without the GIBDA certificate.
It is true that only when an accident was arranged for Europrotocol without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved, there were no physically injured persons, the damage did not exceed the prescribed limit and both drivers agreed on who was the perpetrator of the accident.
Since 2 August, the Europrotocol amounts to 50,000 roubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad areas, it will be raised to 400,000 roubles.
The point is that often, even in minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be defrayed by “europrotocol”, the drivers who have hit the accident are responsible for DPS.
If there was a Casco policy, it could not have been reimbursed without a HIBDD certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft guidance are precisely intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum fee for the accident without HIPD staff should not be lower than the Europrotocol limit.
However, it cannot be higher than the limit defined in the fossco insurance contract.
The idea is undoubtedly useful and theoretically capable of unloading both the DPA and the roads.
But it's probably not going to be fascinated by the motorists or the insurers.
The latter have already highlighted a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new Casco payments rules.
In the case of drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work would have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will in most cases wait for an inspector for hours to deal with a small accident because it's more robust.
It is also unknown that it is easier to win the frauds or to convince the drivers of the "Europrotocol".
The saving certificate will be named and irrevocable
Minfin wants to prohibit saving certificates for a producer, but will allow banks to make them an equivalent of an unrestrained contribution.
Minfin is preparing a bill that would prohibit saving certificates for a producer.
This tool has recently become popular because the rates are higher than the bank deposits.
The case is that the security certificates for the producer are not included in the Insurance Insurance System, and they are cheaper because they do not have to be paid to the Contributions Insurance Agency (ASA).
The practitioner of the situation is that this step is planned because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and will suffer from Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASU estimates, control 98 per cent of the substantive market.
The Agency ' s share of the Moscow Bank is about 3.5 per cent.
The problem, explained in the ASU, is that the customers of the small bank that have purchased such a certificate are trying to obtain money from the ASU if they revok.
Some investors, lacking sufficient financial literacy and purchasing preserving certificates, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justifiable absence of insurance payments for these certificates in the event of revocation of a licence from the bank may lead to misunderstanding and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there have been cases in which the holders of the production certificates tried to recover the insurance compensation through the court”, stated in the ASH.
The problem, of course, is insane.
There will still be no payment to the buyers of certificates because they have no right to reparation from the State under law.
If it were to be true that the instrument was not insured at the ASU, the metal accounts would be banned with it, where the funds of citizens are counted in the grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platein and paladium.
These accounts are also not included in the investment insurance system, but they are not yet tempted to exist.
The case is likely that the producer certificates are a very convenient securities, which can actually serve as a quasideneg.
In doing so, their movement is almost uncontrolled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer a certificate to any citizen and may change a number of owners prior to the discovery of such a certificate.
It is not accidentally stated in the Bill that the saving certificate must be a specific securities that must be kept in the depositary.
In order to secure the pill to the banks, such certificates are allowed to be released without the right to pay before the date.
That is, the analogy of the irrevocable contribution that bankers long dream of.
NATO Summit: First protests in Nouporte and Cardiff
The weekends were protested by those who opposed the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the middle of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at the Kardiff Ruth for what was described as an anti-Sammit.
Stephen Feirklow monitored our developments during the weekends and talked to the protesters who came from Bridgend to Belgium from all over the world.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will place arms in Iraq to counter the Islamic State terrorist groups, informing ITAR Tass, on 31 August, of the decision taken following the meeting of the Government of the FRF, chaired by the Chancellor of Angela Mercel.
Germany is reported to send 30 portable Milan anti-tank missiles and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 rifles G3 and G36.
Supplies will be delivered before the end of September.
It was also decided to allocate an additional 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a Government statement in Bundestag on the subject.
Germany has so far not put its weapons in hot spots.
The views of the people of the FWG on the shipment of arms to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the Islamic State, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
The militias undertook a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea
The Donetsk militia undertook a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Azov Sea, reported on 31 August by ITAR TASS.
It is reported that this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the towns of Shirokino and Unnamed (10-20 kilometres east of Maríupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reported the shelling of two Coast Guards.
It appears that the incident took place today at about 16:20 ms.
Adolescents were taken from the Blue Mountains helicopter
TWO bushuaker teenagers were taken on a helicopter to a safe place after they spent the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man were on their way shortly after noon in Govettes Lip in Blackhita.
Concerned relatives called the police about 8: 00 p.m. when they didn't come home.
A search team was sent to include local police and rescue teams, and a couple found about 11 a.m. near Braidal Weil.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with a couple for the night, and they were raised on a scratch on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blu Mauntins Hospital on an ambulance in a stable state.
Two Unions Meetingd
The Minsk summit negotiations did not solve the problems for which they had been convened, but created a new format: the European Union's first individuals met the first to meet the Eurasian future.
For the most disturbing consideration (the situation around Ukraine is not prone to delay), the EU leaders and the Customs Union have first discussed a number of “critical problems”.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively, unclear; yet it is clear who removed the slips from that summit.
The question falls back on the evening of 26 August, when Belarusians and the other Eurasians and the Europeans saw Lukashenko in the television news of the new President.
The Belarusian leader set an example of exemplary respect, which was the behaviour of a man who had just teared Jeek-pot, and was planning a decent age in higher society.
How Medan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival of three major European Commissioners (EU ministers) to Minsk, which met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak in his final briefing on their behalf, was not merely the legitimation of the President for a 20-year period.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full subject of European policy and a major mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Dennis Melianzas, Senior Analyst at the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies, is confident that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met auntie with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to froze," he said, "The Fire."
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough of the Belarusian authorities began long before November, Mayan, in Kiev, in the summer of 2013.
“Was results achieved and with the EU are successful negotiations on visa simplification and remediation, modernization dialogues,” lists the “Fire” interviewer, and international security negotiations have been held from the United States.
The States have even lifted some sanctions.
With regard to the Ukrainian events, Belarusian leadership and its response were merely inclined to do so.
On the one hand, Minsk was able to maintain a warm relationship with Ukraine, not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure refused to recognize the accession of Crime to Russia and called for the punishment of the pro-Russian militia in Donbassa with all rigorous rigorousness, did not quarrel with Moscow.
The Minsk has not come from either the Customs Union or the DCB, and the Russian airbase is located in the Baranovićs.
Brussels and Washington have noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian question - and appreciated it, assured by the Belarusian experts.
How successful Lukashenko ' s political diversification will be, how often Minsk will soon come to host meetings in the EU+TC format.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expected of relationships in a new format.
Spokesperson Ashton Maya Kosiancić merely stated “Fire” that the issue of war and peace was not a priority.
However, there were reports that Kazakhstan could be the next place of a meeting on the Ukrainian question with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
A statement by President Nursultan Nazarbaev, in which he confessed that he was personally asked by the representatives of the European Union, was made by a plaque for Minsk.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties would not oppose the fact that Minsk would remain a central meeting site, both in Russia - OSCE - Ukraine and at the level of Heads of State and High Representatives of Eurocommissions.
This means that the “Last dictator of Europe” becomes a fully clinged European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
European Farmer’s Best Friend
The composition of the EU delegation, which had included Eurocommunications on trade and energy, had already led to the conclusion that the main theme of the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future negotiations on gas transfers and for overcoming the concerns of TC countries under the Ukrainian Association Agreement with the EU appears to be a larger achievement than the peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gücht, however, pointed out that EU representatives had “entered to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis that had economic consequences, not the contrary”.
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine will work for Belarus.
Its consequences - and primarily the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia - are given to Minsk, who is still under sanctions, the long-awaited field of manoeuvre.
According to the leader of the Mizes Research Centre, ex-condition to the Presidents of Belarus, Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are keenly interested in the capacity of Belarus to deliver agricultural products to the RF in the commutation of sanctions.
There are some supply schemes for which Vladimir Putin at the summit fired Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes, - stressed Romanchuk "Fire," - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long served the delivery schemes, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
Russian business needs something to rebuild, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies do not ask for production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials as well as to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian trade schemes can now be very demanded.”
In the view of Romanchuk, the role of the owner of the EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and for the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from the Moscow sanctions were estimated to be Euro5-10 billion, while Euro25 million were currently offered to the agrarians.
The Belarusian President may invite Brussels to work together to minimize the impact on the euroferers.
This could raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU at an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk of its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is opening up, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
“It was your proposal to gather, without any scrutiny, to discuss, not from the baracht bay, to decide, after the signing of the Treaty of Association with the EU, to deal with the situation that had been in Ukraine at that time,” he addressed the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.
On the other hand, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, and she was initially against Minsk's mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.
At the Belarusian diplomatic department, it is carefully stressed that Belarus, in organizing EU and TC interactions, does not pursue useful goals on its land, but that the ultimate objective of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostock in the future.
“It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, have put forward and promoted the leadership of our strategic allies, the Russian Federation,” said the “Fight fire” in the Ministry of Belarus, a department where the words have recently been scrupulously picked up.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing paid entry zones as a method to combat the overload of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, transmits M24.ru with a reference to the Moscow swamp on the transport of Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has been successfully recommended is the fee entrance.
That's an expert opinion, we're going to study it, we're going to look at all the shortcomings and benefits.
To say that some decisions have been taken on this matter before it's too early," he said to Lixuts.
Zammera stressed that the capital authorities had a very important experience in Asian cities, which were structured and congested like Moscow.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of the central ring road, and Lixuts has been added.
The recent construction of the Central ring road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to skip all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient travel infrastructure, there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow," said the Zammara.
Maxim Lixutov also stated that the introduction of fees had substantially unloaded the capital streets.
He said that the capital authorities did not intend to stop at what they had achieved.
Remember, on 26 August, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobian, participated in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Highway (CACAD).
Treasure is sinful
The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodríguez "The City of Sins-2: The Woman for Whom You Should Kill" has made the wrong revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first “Government of Sin” (2005), removed with the minimum but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, has made a revolution between films, comic books and literary nuares.
Sikwell is also his own revolutionary, in the sense that he is destroying the fundamental for modern thinking chain of "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if it is understood by the nuar universe, and antithesis is space comic books).
From now on, it should be read as "thesis - antithesis - chaos."
The city of sins-2 is chaotic and dramatic, and philosophical: both times it's chaotic in a dumb sense of word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "gorod," although, here, the burst of Marv (Micky Rurk) remembers, has finished life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, but, in the role of this people's wife, is in the air of knives and other axes with whispers.
But the old people are literally scattering newcomers with elbows, as if they were trapped in a city from some other movie, the sense and story of which the audiences are asked not to worry.
So, his story, disgustingly depraved by the authors in the most interesting place, is at the supercompetent Johnny player.
His name is Eva Friedo Lord (Eva Green) and for something vengeful to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, is not to distinguish in his face from Johnny, is that faces, like other parts of the body, are contaminated with unscrupulous regularity, not a disaster or even a half victory.
These aren't people, but we understand that these are NUar archetypes: a rock bitch, too confident a player who had agreed on a "medical trap" of sex detective, corrupted upy senator.
Well, when the archetype walts with the archetype and the archetype, it's no longer a movie, but it's an abstract painting.
And asking the abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this crazy world, there's something permanent.
The fighting slums from the first "gorode" continue to be a circular defense against their own slums of darkness.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is no-no, and he's looking at the fiber, and Bruce Willis is always happy to see.
The main problem of the City of Sin 2 is another.
Frank Miller was good because as a painter, he made a talented comic book and Nuar, and as a director, turned the idea of how to put comic books on the screen.
Comic and Nuar are two aggressive "realities".
The modern Comic Phenomena was born in the late 1920s, while the novels of Dashil Hammet "Bloody Harvest" (1929), the "Maltic Cochel" (1930) and the Glass Key (1931) created the Nuaran canon, which was then called hard-boiled school, a "cross school."
Or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood a lot of tens of heroes: from the Popayan seafood, a spinate devour, giving him rich power, superman, Batman, and the Skasher of Dick Tracy to Halk, Torah, Spider Man, and other "venerers."
But in any movie on the basis of comic books, something was detrimental: painted characters did not want to grow on the screen flesh, remained pretending in their surrounding will of "real" world.
In simple words, they were totally deprived of "existence."
On the contrary, the most extreme genre of world literature.
After world wars, a traditional novel, with experiences, character, family scandals and historical backgrounds, has lost all persuasion.
What kind of Forets, Tibo and Rugon-Makkara, which even Bolkon and Rostoves are even thoughts after Verden, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated in the form of a soap opera, and a criminal, by definition, marginal, novel has risen to a level of philosophical prose.
Hemmett in his skin found out what it was like to work as a sanitary on the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the comparty and genre pillars such as authors Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors of Jul Dessen, Joseph Louzi, Edward Dmitrick.
So the Nuar, whose archetype they gave, first, is rough and cynical, and secondly, purely social.
It's almost an American version of socialism.
The first "The City of Sin" was observed exactly because it was contrary to nature, but it was organically connected with the Nuara comic.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book was alive, not embarrassing its graphic nature, not pretending to be a real film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the horrific son of a satist, was well worthy of Hammet's premium.
And the paintings of a kind of cut-off head, by which the sadist decorated his nest, the genius James Elrroy, the author of the Black Orchid, and the best, that is, a declaratively boring representative of neonar.
"The city of sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller's radical stimulation--Rodriguez before comic tradition.
This must have happened much because of 3D technologies.
When you look at the second "The City of Sin," you feel trapped in a glass ball in which snow falls toy clown.
But most of all, it's not snow, it's bloody fossils, but, in most cases, what difference does it make?
Societies and nothing to say.
It's possible only when we're sometimes on the side of the dirty mud, but there's a normal world to get back on the crooked track of a girl, or let's say to the hopeless parents, that her destructor is punished.
But if there is no place in the city of sin except sin, there is no sin, but the norm.
It's boring like anything.
The City of Sin II is just boring.
Fairness for the sake of domestic leakage has brought this fresh sin to a small but glove.
Tits warn that the film contains harmful smoke scenes.
Referring to the sight, the most vegetarian episode in which man is broken with his fingers, it gives him hell’s humor.
Hammett would like it.
France's socialists have to "knock and order France," says Frasoua Olland, key ally.
Mr. Valle called upon the deeply divided left forces to “prove a warm attitude” towards the attacked President of the Socialist whose restitutions were not approved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves respect for everyone; he deserves our loyalty; he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay with him," he said, calling for applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the Prime Minister believed that his Government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the incitement to conflict, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel McRon, the new Minister of the Economy earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Olland begged his socialist party companions to remain “one” with the Government.
However, Christian Tobira, Minister of Judicial Affairs, put the wheels on the back of the rival parliamentary assembly from the Socialist Party and criticized the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future”.
Marien Le Pé, leader of the extremely legal National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying that she did not represent the new Wall Government to last for more than a few months.
François Olland is a naked king, but the naked and Prince Manuel Valle, who was forced to gather a new government when the summer did not last.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter," said Mrs. Le Pen reporter.
She reiterated her party ' s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she was confident that the party could win easily in early elections and be ready to manage.
The French ruling party had experienced a riot in the March municipal elections, and the extremely right National Front had come first in the EU elections in May.
A survey of Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 per cent of the French believe that the Socialist Party would risk breaking up into several rival factions until Mr. Ollanda's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a politician at the University of Xiannes Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government could not correct the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to be quick to feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may become even worse.
"The City Without Drugs" left without a search
The Sverdlovs Arbitration Court has left without consideration a claim for the directive of the Regional Ministry of Public Administration to the City Without Drugs Foundation.
The mission intended to recover more than 7 million roubles from the organization as rents for the rent of the building in the centre of Ekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear twice in court.
Today, the Sverdlov Province arbitral tribunal has left without consideration the Executive Directive of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Region (ICIGISO) to the City Without Drugs Foundation (one of the founders is the Mayor of Euterinburg, Eugenius Roysmann).
Representatives of the provincial authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million roubles as rents for the building.
It was now known that the plaintiff had twice not appeared before the court, which had led to a denial of proceedings.
The absence of representatives in the IIGISO Directive was unable to explain, and the Chief of Legal Division, Maxim Titus, did not respond to telephone calls.
The Fund was also unable to contact representatives.
Remember, it was a specialist who had occupied a fund at the centre of the city on Belinski Street, 19 on a gratis basis since 2011.
This decision was taken by the ex-hubernator, Alexander Micharino.
In November 2012, the Directive of the Ministry of Public Property Management of the Sverdlov Province filed a claim to the Sverdlov Arbitration Court for the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded, through the court, to recognize an incommunicado contract of free use by a memorial specialist.
In the opinion of the IUGISO Directive, the agreement did not contain substantial conditions for renting a cultural heritage site.
The Heldlovs Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, then appealed to the 17th Arbitration Court of Permi, which was granted.
The fund then filed a cassation complaint to the same court, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court took the side of the Directive.
A new lease contract was concluded in 2013, where the fund began to pay rent again, as the head of the city of Eugenius Roysmann described.
The rent was awarded to 300,000 roubles per month.
The previous Province Administration handed this building to us for gratis use, recognizing our counter-narcotics merits, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration decided otherwise”, he said.

Why mayor Ekatherinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On 24 July, a deputy of the Ekatherinburg hordes, Alexander Kosinz, offered the mayor of Eugeniya Roysmana to resign.
The act served as a criminal case against the arrested person on suspicion of the murder of a retired member of the Hordoma of Oleg Kinev, who was considered a partner of the mayor.
How Eugenia Roysman found a criminal case
On 1 July, it was known that a criminal case had been instituted in the case of “slander” (article 128.1 of the Criminal Code) in the Blog of Mayor Yevgeniya Royzmann.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services in the Sverdlovsk region, where Anna Philatov, a legal director of the Defense Centre, had made a statement.
She said that Mr. Roysman accused her of being involved in the crimes allegedly committed by her ex-wife in his blog record.
The Mayor of Katherinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone will be turned into a wallet.
On the eve of 9 September, when Apple is supposed to present its new developments, there is all the new leaks in the press about what can be expected of the presentation.
With reference to sources, U.S. media reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet as a result of the joint Apple project and payment systems of Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code specialized Internet Re/code, the presentations of new products on 9 September of Apple could, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, which would make the new iPhone 6 smartphone available to the mobile purse function.
The company itself refuses to comment on this matter.
This function enables the payment of the shop by means of a smartphone.
The identification of the payment will be performed by the user by the fingerprint of the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the NFC (near field communication) technology will be introduced in iPhone for the first time, which allows for uncontact payment by means of a smartphone and an appropriate tape reader.
NFC technology itself will be available through a special micro-processor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (former Philips Semiconductors).
The first function of the NFC was presented in 2004 as part of the cooperation of companies Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that entered the so-called NFC Forum, the Association for the Promotion of Technology.
The first phone from NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was presented in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system to allow users to tie bank cards to their Google account and to pay back using the Android smartphone.
On the other hand, American experts stress that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, United States rhetors are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores by such systems.
Therefore, the observers now hope that the way Apple goes to this market will still make the Rielers speed up and more actively implement this technology in their trade points.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Paris ' s position on shipments to Russia is not changed.
The representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Roman Nadal, stated that Paris had a consistent position with regard to the supply of Russian helicopters, such as Mistral.
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (François Ollanda) in an interview by Le Monde of 20 August: “Today, the level of sanctions does not impede the supply of sanctions.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France,” quotes Mr. Nadal, “RIA Newsty.”
Thus, the representative of the French foreign policy agency replied to a question as to whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change in Paris ' s position to implement the contract.

National Security Council: seven military personnel were killed in the force zone for the past days
A representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, Andrew Lisenko, reported that seven Ukrainian soldiers had died in the hostilities zone in the eastern part of the country and another 25 had been wounded over the past days.
The situation under Ilovaski is extremely complicated.
Until an escaping operation has been completed, no details will be made available.
Upon completion of the operation, data on losses and the reasons for the situation will be made public.
The perpetrators of this situation will be held accountable,” added Mr. Lisenko, refusing to discuss more detail the situation under Ilovaisk, where several Ukrainian battalions were brought into the community.
According to the representative of the CIS, “all efforts are being made to return the soldiers who were imprisoned”, reports ITAR TASS.
Mr. Lisenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had departed from the Luhansk airport towards the Georgiewka settlement.

Norwegian Cruise is approaching a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, a third largest cruise operator in the world, is at the end of the negotiations to acquire a similar company of Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion people reported to be familiar with the situation.
The transaction would ensure Norwegian Cruise, market-value companies $6.8 billion, access to cruise vessels of the "lux" class and secured clients of Prestige Cruises, as it competes with larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced this week, reported by sources on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 per cent of Norwegian Cruise shares.
The sources requested that they remain unnamed because the negotiations were not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its income was $2.57 billion in 2013, a 13 per cent increase over 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands of Oceania and Regent, who jointly own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It stated an income of $1.2 billion in 2013, a 6 per cent increase over the previous year.
The growth of the middle-class in developing economies, such as China and India, is expected to contribute favourably to the $29 billion cruise industry in subsequent years.
Companies seek to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new clients.
Prestige Cruises was registered in U.S. regulators for the primary public placement of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the main shareholder of the company after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it is now, in 2000 as a result of merger with a cruise operator belonging to Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a entertainment conglomerate and a casino controlled by a Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned 28 per cent, Apollo owned 20 per cent, and the private investment company TPG Capital LP owned an 8 per cent share in the company, according to the report at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 per cent of cruise shipping in North America, according to registration documents at the first public placement of Prestige Cruises shares.
The Krim Television Company can obtain 250 million roubles of subsidies
In the Ministry of Communities, it is proposed to provide a public radio radio company of 250 million roubles in 2014.
As indicated in the draft decision of the Mincommunicado, on a single portal of disclosure of the preparation of regulations, subsidies are planned to spend “through the cost of creating conditions for extensive information on the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space in the territory of the Republic of Krym”.
Money will also go for the purchase of equipment, the repair of the roof and energy systems in the radio station based in 1959, reports “RIA Newsty”.
Hong Kong democratic movement activists stop speaking by the Chinese representative the following day after the election decision is taken
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress on Sunday established a procedure for only two or three candidates to participate in the elections of Hong Kong leader in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of the majority of members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of the Beijing Layalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the electoral newsletter and has forced activists of the democratic movement to promise to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will extend to other cities.
Following the publication by Beijing of a document describing China ' s control over Hong Kong, in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands went to the business centre of the city and set up a seat strike.
Briefing Lee is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Bureau in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairperson of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Assembly, Jean Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Bureau for Hong Kong and Macao Affairs of the State Council of Feng Vay, were also required to address a series of briefings during the day.
Students stated that they would gather at the Hong Kong Head's Building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to accede to 400 hectares of land belonging to Palestinian autonomy
The Israeli authorities announced that they intended to join 400 hectares of land on the western side of the Jordan River, belonging to Palestinian autonomy.
The decision to accede to the land of South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to repay the abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers in June.
Israel's Minister of Defence announced the occupation of the territory on Sunday and mandated the military to establish an administrative office on the western bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip, Saib Arikat, the world public must call upon Israel to respond for “the ongoing settlement activity on the western side of Jordan and in East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires Kiev to commence negotiations on the “Statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “Statehood” of the separated region.
His Spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin was not implying that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of separatists would be part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be reviewed to enable the Russian-speaking region to protect its rights and interests.
However, the call by Putin for the Kiev Government to begin negotiations with the pro-Syrian insurgents as equally consistent with the obvious strategy to be followed from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help separatists to take the territory and to force the Ukrainian Government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Norossia the actual independence to draw close to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the State Television First Canal, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory held by separatists in eastern Donetsk and Luhanas, which was captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula to Krym on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists recently called the occupied territories of New Russia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire's glory.
Putin said that anyone who believed that peace talks would take place in the near future, when Ukrainian policies began campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and while government troops attacked peaceful settlements in the separatists- held regions, Illussian prisoners, reported ITAR TASS.
“We must immediately commence meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political system of society and State status of South-Eastern Ukraine, in order to meet the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peaks said that Putin's words on statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm the fears of Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can provide Eastern regions with the necessary autonomy, said Peakov.
This is not a question for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peakov, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict”.
The intervention by the Spokesperson of the Kremlin to correct the “negotiable interpretation” of Putin's words underscored the decision of the Russian leadership to act against the separatist rebellion in the east in a different way than the open capture of Cym, where the majority of the two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much more severe battle to join the Donetsk and Lugan region of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents were not Russian, and the surveys prior to the beginning of the conflict showed wide support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional Governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policies themselves, in fact, by transmitting to the Kremlu the actual control of the territory that would unite the main territory of Russia with the Crime.
The Black Sea peninsula, affiliated five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.
There are mines, factories and plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army in the regions between the Russian Rostow region and Crimea.
President Peter Poroschenko, Ukraine, proposed, during his inaugural speech on 7 June, that Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, weigh the constitutional amendments to enable the regions to be more independent of their finance and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armaments and incitement are accused of Moscow.
The last call by Putin to Kiev to agree with the leaders of separatists, as equal, was followed by the new insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from the former peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
Russia ' s separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an attack that Ukrainian security officials are afraid that it is the beginning of a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory until the city itself.
This has resulted in extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupla, a steady port of 500,000 inhabitants, which is between the Novosaka and the narrow passage to the Krem Peninsula.
On Saturday, Proshenko addressed the European Union Leaders ' Assembly in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which was independent of 23 years of age.
"We're approaching the point of non-return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU Summit has not taken certain measures; leaders have called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilowaisk after two colonies of Russian armoured equipment and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support the difficulties of separatists, Colonel Andrey Lisenko, the Ukrainian Spokesperson of the National Security and Defence Council, reported to the reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were reportedly held in Ilowaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian air assets captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago and reported to Lisenko on Sunday.
A scandal with naked photo captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust for the hackers who might have stolen the naked pictures of his fiancée Gabi Greco and the whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood in resentment after a number of frank photos depicted by naked Jennifer Lawrence came on the Internet as a result of a massive hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible has about 60 frank photographs of the star "Holy Games" Lourence and superstars, including the models of Keith Appton and Kara Delevin, the singers of Rianne, Ariana Grande and Lia Michelle and the actress of Kirsten Danst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonn Strahawski, who lives in Melbourne Greco, were also suspected to have stolen photographs as a result of leakage from iCloud.
List 101 with the name of celebrities.
Edelsten, who made a Greek proposal last month, said Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It is horrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to others.
Greco, who is reportedly in New York City, told the news website that the hacker attack was "disgusting" and that those to whom it was directed would feel that they were invaded.
The hacker is expected to have 30 photographs of Palmer with a former boyfriend, Scott Spidman, including two frames of the basin with a naked breast.
Palmer's work in the movies includes "Love and Honor" with Liam Hemsurt.
Palmer, the "Chuck" film and the actress from "Prohibition Reception" Browning didn't comment yesterday on the stolen photographs.
The representative of Lawrence said to TMZ, "It's a gross invasion of private life."
The actter Seth Rogen expressed his disdain for a hacker, who wrote to Twitter, "to put pictures stolen from a mobile phone, in fact, are not different from the sale of stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, the publication of stolen photographs cannot be tolerated.
Potential theft of naked celebrities
The mass hacking of the stars' acquaintances may be caused by vulnerability in the application Find My Phone.
The Potential Scenario of Development described the resource The Next Web.
In the Github resource, a script was published in Python, which allowed to pick the passwords for the Find My Phone Service of Apple.
This service allows the tracking of iPhone location.
The same logging link and Apple ID password is used to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photographs of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the process of learning the password from Find My Phone.
The method has been consistently introduced with all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The author of the script argued that in the Find My Phone service, the number of passwords entered was unlimited.
When the right security system is organized, after several failed attempts to enter an incorrect record password, the account must be blocked and reported to the user about an attempt to hack.
Because of vulnerability, the users have not received any reports of an attempt to pick up the password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to Hackapp in Twitter, vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripting program was written to pick passwords.
Vulnerability is now closed: access to the service is blocked after five attempts.
The resource was linked to the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above vulnerability was characterized by many services, but noted that there was no evidence that this vulnerability had been used to access the “stars” account.
It's not me, plz RT.
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again came up with foreign records.
Although there is no solid evidence that vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photographies, there has been a wave of harmful actions in the past using this service.
The hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded the ransom from the owners.
In the case, Apple stated to the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how the users lost their accounts.
The Tweeter of the Prime Minister of the RF, Dmitri Medvedev, had also been hacked in Russia.
If the abusers had access to the iCloud described above, there could also be a password for the head of Government ' s account in the microblogging service.
Resource The Next Web failed to get Apple comments on vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian Five-Border
The Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to a well-known Ukrainian athlete Anne Burak.
The decree has been issued on the Internet legal information portal.
At the beginning of this year, an athlete moved to Russia to permanent residence and asked the Federation of Modern Five Campaigns to provide her with an opportunity to advocate for a collection RF.
In 2013, she won two phases of the world's Cup, won the silver medal of the European championship in person and became a champion of peace in a mixed estaphite, one of the new types of sports programme.
It also holds leadership positions during the current season.
In accordance with the rules, she will have to obtain special permission from the Ukrainian Olympic Committee at Rio de Janeiro to address Olympics-2016.
Anna Burak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to Katherine Lagno - Lviva championship of Europe (2005, 2008), the world on the table (2010) and the rapid chess (2014).
Among the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete became the winner of the chess olimpiad in Turin (2006), the Astana World Commander (2013) and the European Command Championship in Warsaw (2013).
SRD discontinued the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Inukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (SCR) has discontinued the criminal case of the Red Wings aerial crash of the Red Wings aircraft.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was taken in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and aircraftman.
The judicial review revealed that the catastrophe was caused by an increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to implement the standard procedures at landing, and the unintentional exit of the engines for increased direct traffic.
The Red Wings Airplane aircraft, following the Prague-Moskwa flight, crashed on 29 December 2012 when landing at the Inukovo airport in Moscow.
The airship was blown out and fired.
Aircraft commander, second pilot and shipwreckman were killed at the scene.
Two shipwrecks were taken to hospitals where the injuries subsequently died.
Three more staff hospitalized with severe bodily injuries received long treatment.
In addition, a driver who was driving at the time of the disaster on the Kiev highway received serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board an aircraft.
The Office of the Procurator ' s Office of Transport, after the disaster, conducted a screening at Red Wings, during which many violations were detected.
Aviation licence was suspended in February 2013.
The company resumed its work in summer 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko began training in SISO
A well-known Russian militias Alexander Emelianenko, 33-year-old Alexander, who is in SIZO for sexual assault against a worker, has recovered completely from injuries and has begun training.
This is reported by the Championship.
In May this year, the Russian Investigation Committee charged Alexander Emelianenko with rape.
The suspect was declared in search on 9 May, he was detained in Tambov following an accident, which resulted in a fracture of the thigh.
An Emelianne junior was arrested until 31 August and sentence was handed down on 1 September.
However, the court had been postponed and the investigation had been imposed to extend the period of detention until 30 September.
If the athlete's fault is proven, he is in prison for up to six years.
What's the power, brother?
"Lanta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in the career of Alexander Emelianenko.
His last meal was held in January of this year, and he lost his technical nightmare to a fellow countryman, Dmitri Skosski.
Alexander is the younger brother of Fedor, Emelianenko.
The latter is a four-fold champion of the world on mixed martial arts, a four-fold champion of peace and a seven-fold Russian champion on a fighting Sambo.
Grief has proved to be the most universal and functional emotion of the human being
The heartfelt expression of the person is biologically universal for humankind, and every body and group of muscles involved is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threats, and researchers in Australia and the United States have found.
They told about their discoveries in the Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and you can briefly read them in a press release at the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The rage of the face is a shifted and downward eyebrows pulled into the thin lip line, the sparkling nostrils are the same in all cultures, and they make it even blind children who never saw it, notes the lead author of the study, Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion has emerged to deal effectively with disputes during the conflict.
The more physical harm one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his or her condition, and he brings it to the interlocutor by means of anger.
Researchers have found evidence of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more aggravated and become handcuffed, feel entitled to impose unfavourable conditions on others, and prefer to use force to resolve conflicts peacefully.
Resulting from the fact that anger is primarily “the emotion of the bid”, scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles creating an abusive expression should represent an angry individual to be more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus make it possible to accept his conditions to avoid conflict as soon as possible.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers modelled on the computer a person who had each of the seven elements of an angry person, or who was missing, and showed them to the informants.
Although omitted brows or forward chin did not separately make the person wicked, the person described with such features was unanimously recognized by the higher physical participants in the study.
Man’s anger, like that of the animals, is a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own strength that compels him to accept and obey.
A person blows his nostrils and squeezes his lips for the same purpose as a frog that is wearing, or a grandmother who shows his balds.
“The fiery refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation is “commenced”, and the person takes the form as quickly as possible demonstrating to the opposite side the consequences of the refusal.
