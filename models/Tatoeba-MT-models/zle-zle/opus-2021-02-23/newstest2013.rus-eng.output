Republic Resistance Strategy for the Re-electing of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans have justified their policy to combat falsification in the elections.
However, at the Brennan Centre, it is the last myth, claiming that falsifications in the United States elections are more rare than deaths from the impact of the lightning.
In addition, only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States have been counted by the Republican lawyers.
One thing can be said with certainty that these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, United States states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have enacted laws since 2009 that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon was newly expanded after the elections in November 2010, which brought 675 new seats to the Republicans in 26 states.
As a result, 180 laws restricting voting rights in 41 states were adopted in 2011 alone.
New electoral laws require the voter to issue identity cards with photograph and evidence of American nationality.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early vote, abolish the right to vote on the voter ' s vote on the day of voluntarily pronouncement, and subtract the right to vote from citizens having jurisdiction.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state obliged voters to issue identity cards with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state to impose such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the Indian law.
The Republican authorities have hurried to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to produce identity cards with a photograph in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a medical insurance card.
Indeed, 11 per cent of American citizens, or 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote, do not have identity cards with a photograph issued by the State Government.
In addition, five million new voters have no such document in 2012.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people who earn less than 35,000 dollars, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years do not have the required identity card with a photograph.
But that's not all.
Electoral students who are believed to vote for candidates from democrats are not allowed in several states to use identity cards with a photograph issued by their educational institution.
However, the same states permit members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly for the Republicans, to use the certificates issued by the clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no State required proof of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have enacted laws requiring voters to prove that they are United States citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latin Americans.
Two thirds of Latin American voters are believed to vote in favour of the Democratic Party.
In addition, the Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on the vote day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation has not passed without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped bring about 10 million citizens into the lists.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have led to a decline of 17 per cent in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states aimed at reducing the period of early balloting.
For example, during the 2008 general elections in Florida, 33 per cent of pre-term voters were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13 per cent of the total number of state voters.
The same has been done with Latin Americans.
Only 11 per cent of the voters represented 24 per cent of the citizens who voted before the date.
Unlike the whites, 76 per cent of the voters, only 46 per cent of the voters pre-term voted.
Of course, democrat legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to enacting laws restricting voter registration.
Several draft laws were veiled by democrat governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended when the United States Prosecutor-General intervened.
This has limited partially the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring identity identification with a photograph.
However, the new rules that had entered into force certainly made it difficult to exercise the electoral right in the 2012 elections.
Critics against democrats condemn the bias of the laws that had been enacted, with a clear focus on influencing the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The 2011 report of the Centre of Brennan shows that the States that have enacted these laws represent 171 out of 270 votes required by the electoral panel to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to assert with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of voters.
In that sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Carbon screening: Do you have a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes produces mistaken results, false negatives, and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical interventions.
Husbands, and so reluctant to go through dyscape, have much more to doubt.
Do you have a test or not?
We asked the views of two experts.
Research conducted in the United States has witnessed numerous cases of infection among the research groups, so it is difficult to interpret and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different levels of death in those patients who had been screening and those who did not.
The study also revealed, after 12 years of observation, that the probability of metastastage is 30 to 40 per cent higher for those who have not been screening.
So I would recommend a test starting from 50 years, or from 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of Afro-American descent are also at high risk.
The key is to take the right solution as soon as cancer is detected.
Can be both aggressive and blunt.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer by offering him possible options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a risk to life in the long term, but by making choices, in these cases, to actively monitor the disease.
To date, many men with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
We'll offer them active surveillance, and if the disease starts progressing, we'll start treatment.
Increasingly, we define precisely the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So, I would recommend a test anyway.
However, it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether the test is needed or not.
In cooperation with the International Urology Association, Mowember created a tool to assess everything for and against the PSA test.

Prevention of Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous reception to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people were to eat well and to move enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“Had no one smoked any more, this figure would have increased to at least 50%,” stresses André Bolje, Spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases are caused by inheritance.
Several types of cancer remain entirely ambiguous.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 per cent of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to human health.
"Now there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," says Spokesperson André Bolje.
It is encouraging to note that 10 years after smoking has been refused, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to CAR, surplus weight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, fat and direct intestines, foodstuffs, pancreas and uterus.
“Scientific studies show that regular physical activity throughout the lifetime protects against the cancer of a fat gut”, adds to the Association.
Nutrition
The Association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of cancer of fat intestines.
Silver products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by boiling, drying or salt may lead to carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can harm the body's cells and lead to cancer”, explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the impact of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But to date, the results of these studies are not unambiguous.
In the opinion of SCC, research on vitamin E produces contradictory results.
If one showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other had the opposite effect.
In assessing the impact of vitamin D cancer, too, there is no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bolio emphasized that it was important to discuss his concerns and family anamnes with the doctor.
"Drawing the analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Boson Higgs in detail
Last summer, a report that scientists may have discovered a Higgs Boson may have caused a real fusion - and not without justification.
It is believed that this is an explanation of the mass of all particles in the universe, and there is little.
In addition, this is the last particle that was predicted in the Standard Model -- our best, or, in any case, "the least of the imperfect" descriptions of the nature and behaviour of matter -- but which had never previously been detected by an experienced way.
But physics aren't sure it's the Higgs Bosson.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we're dealing with a really new particle and that it's very much resembling the Higgs Boson, as foretold by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one major physical convention in Kyoto seem to confirm this, although some data are not yet available for full confidence.
But let's imagine it's the Higgs Boson because the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is absolutely inevitable, saying that two things can't be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to pass this rule, not even to try too hard, or to harm yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of such a nature: the principle of the exception of Pauly, which stating that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same point of time, if they remain in the same “quantine state”, is the“constituency”, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Consequently, physics divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermentions, who are wisely following Pauli’s principle.
Another involves bosses, a rude gang of anarchists, who have no respect for at least anything, which means that they can find themselves in the same place calmly at the same time.
According to the site, the Part of Adventure Laboratory of Berkeley, these bosons are divided into two groups: mezones that we won't talk about here and "particles of force" by which the fundamental forces of nature are distributed and which in some ways belong to the Higgs Boson.
Not all such exotic creatures as one might think, should be emphasized.
In fact, if you're able to read this chronique, it's because of one incredibly banal boson: photon, or "part of light," which is the "courer" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle that has an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it's an electromagnetic field in this particular place like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this “infrastructure” a electromagnetic wave (the light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and the wave is nothing but a photon, and hence one of the “power carriers”.
A more stable field
The same is true for the Higgs Boson, with the only difference that the Higgs field must be "broken" in order to produce the boss.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to erupt it, very and very high energy must be achieved, as if it were a frozen pond that could only shake a very large stone.
That's why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one that operates in CERN -- the Great Adron Collaider, a ring of 27 km diameter! -- to achieve such enormous energy.
An analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs Boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stick to the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (as photon, by the way) do not have it.
So, what can "might bring" all these studies, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to break the difference between observation results and GM forecasts.
In addition, some of them yearn for such a discrepancy to be found, so the smallest inconsistencies can open the door for "new physics" and shut some of the Model holes.
The latter, to be said, still has significant shortcomings without any explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80 per cent of the universe (oh!).
But yet there's no such discrepancies in CERN.
Consequences
The use of these studies for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See, at the beginning of the 1960s, the Laser Research pioneers in Belle Laboratorys could not even assume the revolution that would cause them to work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but not more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Laboratory in 1960, was invented by the laser, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (presided as pulse) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered rather as the Laboratory Gadget.
Imagine...
In addition, the annex can be found for the study toolkit.
For example, the same William Boyle, during his 1969 optical study, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although not originally intended, now serves as a “sight” for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the Nobel Prize for physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Great Adron Collider will necessarily change our life, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Polytical help is the best way to die... "Dolg"
The Commission for Decent Death in Quebec had recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, and the bill is being drafted.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Dolg" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L.
The prostate cancer that destroyed it from within gave him a two-year delay.
"I've been given five years, I've lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the palliative care shelter of Victor Gaddbua in Belay, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job — an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table on which a meal is adventurous, he surrenders and agrees to be helped to eat.
He is awake, even wise to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, to bring him medicines, to the bathroom.
Courage before normal death.
"My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for the disease.
"In life, we are taught that a man must urine standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gaddbua.
Repress to the condition of the child - for some, it is abject humiliation.
"Everything depends on the ability of man" to accept deterioration, he claims.
Since many people who are engaged in palliative care are of the opinion, important events are also at the severance of the decay.
Patients who get into Victor Gaddbua's palliative shelter are all cancer-infected.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide any more assistance called "medical."
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "in the consciousness of suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything in life anymore," she says, before she lets her put a mask that facilitates breathing.
She continues to look forward to her son's last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In Victor Gadbua, a group of volunteers provide care for the body and nutritional assistance.
It is a palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 residents, there is one place in palliative care facilities.
It's very little because we're all gonna die sooner or later.
Here life continues in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the shelter.
It is physical, emotional, or emotional comfort.
We will agree to give the dead one the mouth of brandy or ashes, looking for what he will ask.
Diabetics, we don't have to control the sugar level anymore.
And death is part of the day-to-day.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning his son drank that beer in the feet of the deceased.
"We're helping the loved ones as well as the patients," says Natalie Sawar, director of care for the patients.
There's no day like Victor Gadbua in the shelter.
Along with a 93-year-old, who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, putting his pillows on his pillows in his honor, the tragic death of a young man for 36 years surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and tested everything to survive.
"In the last six months, between three and five cocks, they are always engaged in cancers under the age of 45," says Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of patients admitted to Victor Gaddbua ' s shelter come from home and 47 per cent from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77 per cent of Canadians are considered to have no access to palliative care, i.e. care provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who entered the final stage of their life, whether at home, at the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as Victor Hadbua ' s shelter and the Big Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less solely in caring for cancer patients.
It is this great gap in the health system of Quebec that makes many doctors on palliative care fear the enactment of a law legalizing euthanasia and suicide assistance.
Beginning in October, a manifest signed by the lights in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfur Maunt and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant, testified to their disagreement with this initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec's health system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative quality care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, "I saw a patient who spent 14 days in an ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I'm afraid patients want to die only because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic predictions.
Elen Richard's hopes for survival were already minimal when she stopped boring chemotherapy.
When I told my tutor that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I was stopping the fight, she said.
At the same time, she said to me herself that my days were counted!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 percent of the patients who ask for death are due to the medical staff for failing to comply with their request after the palliative care team makes them feel hurt.
It should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of palliative care at the Big Montreal home, the patients are not sensitive to dehydration in 8 per cent of the cases.
At the very end of the lifetime, doctors often resort to palliative sediment, where the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time, or permanently.
We can't pretend more that we don't know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who are unable to alleviate pain will be able to have access to palliative seedlings.
The pain sufferers always say the same phrase, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want to be evtanased," it means "I want to get easier."
This report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute of Health Studies of Canada.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party fund collectors and Italian Mafia specialists daily share what they know about the colossal “system”, the confusing construction industry, public officials, politicians, trade union figures and mafiosia.
“Industry”, which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's interesting how this system goes out after all the money has been put in motion, Jacques Ducheno, the deputy and the former Chief of the Montreal Police. "
It was in 2011 that it created a scandal as a side result of an investigation of official crimes involving road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister of Liberia, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
Ducheno's report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
“From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, only the Ministry of Transport would retain billions of dollars on contracts”, if some were to deter their instincts to take their share.
The Sharbonno Commission “replaced the two mayors,” he adds, hoping she would be able to “open the schemes behind individual individuals”.
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, included a wide state of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the Special Unit of Molot, which had forced Montreal's Static Cartel after 2009, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been conducted over the past weeks, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotto Mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
In turn, Gil Wyancour, who recently resigned from the post of mayor Lavaly, the third largest city of Quebec.
He was suspected of receiving bribes on a number of occasions when public orders were ordered.
In addition, several engineers were charged with a number of ways to report to Montreal and to construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accquo and Lino Zambito.
The latter exploded this bomb by investigating the “system” of obtaining public contracts.
For several years, Zambito paid 3 per cent of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal to some mediator associated with the Mafia, who in turn remitted the money of the Mayor of Gerald Tramble Joint Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito blew money to the right and left, listing more than $88,000 (about Euro68,000) to various parties in the province, mostly liberal, who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he had illegally collected funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Sanitation contracts overestimated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked unreservedly.
Jill Surprenan, a former civil-building engineer, described it in detail to the commission: in ten years he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to visit, golf tournament, restaurants, Hokkey matches and bribes totalling $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads admitted that they received 30 to 40 per cent overscores by counterfeiting supplements.
Next, an organizer from the Mayor party, Martín Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately closing his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget that filled party cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned early in November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal who had been alarmed.
The Mayor of Rivier de Préri County, east of the island, has been countering the sale of a municipal site purchased for $5 million and resold for... 1.6 million builders in the bush.
70% of dirty money in pre-election campaigns
She said that in an investigation which would eventually start, she would "take out a thread to understand the operation of a system that was thrown by the ants to stop the gangren and identify the perpetrators."
This process is characterized as “indulgent but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of doubtful practices.
How we're cleaning up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Duscheno observes for his part that “the employers stole hundreds of millions of dollars” but is particularly concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about this scheme” but who did not participate in the scheme.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding the Quebec electoral campaign reached 70 per cent, he joked, "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit up to 100 dollars of donation to parties, but he said that this would not change the situation: “As long as we do not strictly limit the cost, there will be dirty money in politics”.
It calls for a complete restructuring of the system for the provision of public contracts and the financing of parties: “We can't go downwards; with courage, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality”.
If this story and casts the shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dusheno calls on those who laugh to look into their own yard...
"PSW - not the FC Barcelona!"
At this season, you've reached an extraordinary scale in the SPW.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but may also by the new measurement of the SPL.
Great players arrived.
I'm going to grow with them every day.
Technical staff have also contributed much.
These factors make me to raise the level of my game every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
It's going on very fast in football.
But I'm not breaking up.
From the very beginning in the NIF pre-training centre in Clerfonten and before I came to St. Etien, I've always stepped forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
It's not a news to play a very high-level match this summer.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me wanting to be at the level and to tire out as much as possible.
Carlo Anchelotti also supports my position.
He is assisted by alternates like Claude Macelle, who played the same position as me.
Anchelotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Anchelotti is encouraging respect for all technical personnel.
Today, in the First League, he is unequal and is among the best trainers in Europe.
He had extensive experience, and he won many titles with high school clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring Paris' new titles.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I left a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the SPW season?
Lyon took our leader's place in the First League.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is the League of Championes: we have been effectively qualified for one eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We will be able to speak face-to-face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish the first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the answer to the one-eighth final match.
Could SCW become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needed to win titles and take positions on a long-term perspective.
That's not true today.
Financially, PMS has funds to make the project real.
Shouldn't take titles in the First League, like last season, be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get this championship.
Last season, we were close to that.
In May, it was disappointing because we had everything to come to the finishing work first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points involve the ranking of the champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it'll be all right.
Despite the fact that there were strong teams like Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Don't you think the media are waiting for too much of the FSW?
It's normal that we're looking forward to a lot, given how much we've been invested and how many players we have.
We're all ready for that.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troa and we are still finding something to criticize, of course, it's a little upset.
We're wondering what people expect first of all from us.
We'll never be able to win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FK Barcelona!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The command is formed over time.
We have proved in the League of Championes that we can meet modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who hasn't been able to go to one eighth of the seasons, even though they've spent huge money!
Given the amounts we have invested, we have represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be disrespectful of our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseilles, who weren't at the altitude of the last season, were “exploded ” by this new VCG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won.
The SPL seems to be completely dependent on the victories of Zlatan Ibrahimović.
Well, if they say there's some kind of "Glathan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimović is very successful and that he's beating a lot of heads.
He came for it and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a big player and a star of the world.
In the group, we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exclusive.
This also encourages others to improve their games.
Thiago Silva, one of the best advocates in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with the French assembly?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to participate in that Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me from losing a little game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Tonight, I'm able to play good pick-up matches.
That's what I was hoping for since I was baptized at Blueh.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we must now act exemplaryly.
What do you think of the first months of Dead Dasham's head of the Blue?
They're good for him.
He has good positions in the selection group for the world's championship.
He's a tough coach, he's close to the players and inspiring to win.
What Laurent Blan was like.
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Blan has achieved his goal, he has qualified us in Euro.
I hope Desham will bring the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved niche (1-1) expelled in Spain on 16 October is a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in itself.
Everybody fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, my career had no matches like that.
Pay and sell without banks - with Bitcoin
Contrary to current cash exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between recipient parties with commission charges for processing them.
Furthermore, the frequency of these technologies is evident in the political vision: the belief that the current monetary system consisting of banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudony), is simultaneously a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, Euro...) and a secure protocol of exchange by type of BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between the participants of the same level.
Approximately 200,000 operations have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousands of sites are used as battocks to make donations or as a payment fund.
By reaching a maximum of $30 (Euro 23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, before returning to about $10 today (coincharts.com are listed on the web site).
Nothing special than the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency published in October was interested in the system.
He describes the bitcoin as the most successful virtual currency, the “competing with the dollar or the euro” and the “conforming to normal currencies”.
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote video games that are earned in the game or that can be purchased (and sometimes exchanged).
Facebook's social network has also developed a system like that.
But the exchange operations always control and process a central body.
In Bitcoin, all network knots are both accountants, auditors, currency emitts, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between the two users actually occurs between the two e-mails.
For each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to the transaction is signed electronically using a double-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcakes used in the transaction actually exist in a public account book sent throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It is through a thematic task sent to computers that, as a temporary central bank, is privileged to add that new line.
This is the phase of the file heating, that is, transforming a large file into a digital signature, a short and unique one.
Computers take a new transaction and add a number to it before they hang together.
The objective is to find a number that gives a unique digital signature (a lot of zero at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other nodes easily test it as to what is right.
Transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, in order to deceive the user very quickly (less than in 10 minutes), he wished to pay twice the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would be unconfirmed because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem gets 50 bitcones.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward is regularly shared in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcones in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided up to one hundred million, leaving another reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increasing with increased computation capacity.
The life of the network has been overwhelmed by air and falls.
Bitcoin websites were attacked, and the Batcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The defect used does not apply to the protocol itself”, assures Pierre Nuaz, who recently launched Paymium, a paying company with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money-laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this shortage.
Large players like Wikipedia refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress blog form, are allowed.
Recently, Adie Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weitzman Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and found that almost 80% of the bitcones were not in circulation.
The Giant Spences were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," rejoiced Jon Holmquistis, working at Coinabul, who is engaged in the conversion of bitcones into gold.
Pierre Nouaza, another author of the Currency Benefit, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or an uncontact payment through a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is therefore cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just tell us the address that Pierre Nouaz can "photo and recognize" by the phone, assures him that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend of revising hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal ones.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 can be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, proposes, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are now considered to be higher if the system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capacia and Surobi).
NATO and Americans should follow them in late 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to restore control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying on us alone.
We were mostly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even though they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajikistans.
They are suffering, sometimes assisted by local rebels, but they will no longer be treated as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed at the height of the hills of mined trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
There's no Taliban attack on Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Their control was then perceived as a kind of release, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid for the martyrdom of these peasants, where they were exceeded by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our day.
Former модjahedes, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to hold women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become divers that take over State land to resell them under the construction of returnees returning from Iran and Pakistan using huge United States subcontracting contracts.
They were discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in rural areas, want a government that's not a thief.
Many young people want to go away as those who have made America’s generosity — capital outflows are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated its advantages.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; in Kabul there are now 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the population.
Public schools in urban areas are filled with both boys and girls.
The workplaces of these young people must be ensured that they do not want to return to the martyrdom of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militia, loves mobile phones, television, and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world, which are seen everywhere.
There is now an army.
The authorities that will command her, will they be legitimized?
Old commanders fighting anti-Soviet have already taken steps to restore provincial wives who do not submit to the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, should be to some degree decentralized, according to the Western countries, but the United States wanted to make it a central State with a strong presidential power, rescinding the Prime Minister, who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting in the 1950s and even before, depends on foreign assistance.
Industry was not placed on its feet, no dam operated, no irrigation system was repaired.
All are imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority has been given to the private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, public infrastructure control would be necessary.
It has been rumored that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that western countries were present there to capture them.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on the ground, without means of transportation to export them through mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese had almost left the Mes Einak site, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest provincial employers.
It is also necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations on one day equally.
The withdrawal of French military units ended 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional assistance: girls ' face, boys, French-language faculty at the University, French Institute, military cooperation, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer hearts and minds” and to carry out the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the “military-civil” service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public work and activities aimed at rebuilding agriculture in tens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of local workers, have helped to contain revolt: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of soils and increases in the area of arable land.
What are we going to keep in mind by spending two billion euros on military expenditures?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, which are very severe in these valleys, often at a height of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capisas.
In order to get rid of the rebellion led by foreign factions, what the farmers wanted, as they said, must be given them a small non-military support that would be well controlled and directly controlled.
Hard births of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky step by President Mohammed Mursy.
While Egypt was divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily empowered it, it decided to play the bank.
Constituting everyone offended, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Equally a week ago, the Head of State provided the Assembly with two additional months to complete the work.
Shortly after two years, Egypt had relied on the preliminary text, which had been amended several times, which had weakened institutional stability and led to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only reinforced the division of the country.
In the opinion of his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic bargain”, continuing to “crime the word” and “to violate the right”.
In the camp, his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by expediting the transition process.
The referendum should be held for fifteen days.
The very short period of time that makes the brothers refuse to explain the text to the Egyptians, article after article.
For the President, it is also a way of restoring public and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morcy seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he stated in an interview to American Time Week.
The more appeal for a accelerated vote comes to the ultimatum of the Egyptian people, “If you vote for my text, or if I leave myself with extraordinary powers”, which are expected to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberians did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 persons, sparers, were promptly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is no wonder that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, added to the fact that one of the few discords of the day had arisen around... the time for prayer, since some members of the committee felt that the Constituent Assembly’s clock had been wrong.
The text on which the vote was taken yesterday consisted of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2, ultimately, remained an identical article from the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the Shariah's principles are the main source of the law”.
The Salaphist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law was a fundamental requirement, hoped to replace “principles” with “rules”, which would enable them to be more strictly applied.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Licemery," the liberals answer that only see the pier.
Because, in their view, the Islamicization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which provides counselling to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to checking the conformity of Sharia laws.
According to an expert on Egypt, Sophie Pomeye, this is alarming, that is, “people who are to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can watch the theocratic birth."
Many liberals are also impressed by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the present one.
"There is no specific religious intervention at present.
We remain within the framework of civil law with this constitution.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not slums, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system" -- calms Alexis Blooe, who is preparing a dissertation for the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that “art. 220 may be mixed, since the terms used therein are borrowed from religious lexics.
This applies in particular to “fixes” [Islamic jurisprudence].
In the future, the question may arise as to the extent that civil judges are competent to decide on it.”
In addition to its religious dimension, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers argue that they have declined considerably compared with the old regime.
Another controversial point: powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defence budget will be considered, not in Parliament, but in the National Defence Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text they considered to be destructive to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been retained and insult is now prohibited, which may have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speak of the protection of a woman, stresses Heba Moraif, from Human Wrights Watch.
She said that the prohibition of torture in article 36 was the only positive point.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was supposed to be on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled today in the afternoon.
Participants of the Head of State will, in turn, go to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaiting holy places, the Pump of the Earth and the sea from the scattered sea
The earth of the Promised One unites the majesty of Bible truths, the modern comfort, and the paramount nature.
The AIF identified five of the most important reasons for being in Israel.
Worship Sacred Places
We should visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God's grace is jeopardized for all those who enter this shop.
Galileo is the place of Jesus ’ miracles: the marriage of water into wine, the passage of water, the soothing of the storm, and the filling of the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after his resurrection.
But most of all, the sanctuaries in Jerusalem.
The believers here follow the Skorbi Way or the Cross Way of Jesus (latin Via Doloroz).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia Pretorium, where there was a court, and leads the streets of the Old City to the Temple of the Grobe of the Lord on Mount Golgof, to the place of Raventius, the Stone of Anointedia and the place of Jesus ’ burial.
Here, too, is the symbolic Christian Pump of the earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross monastery in Jerusalem is built on a site where, according to Christian legend, a tree was raised from which a cross was made to crucify Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most holy place for the Jews, the Sten of Glasch, left behind the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different religions leave notes with desires that are then fulfilled.
Traveling Vertically
The ruins of Massad’s fortification remained from the secret refuge of the enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 B.C.E. for his family.
They are situated on wet rocks in the mountains at a height of 450 m above the ocean level.
Only those who engage in alpinism can reach them.
The rest are brought to this historic peak by a rope climber.
In the north of the country, 1600-2040 metres are the famous mining resort Hermon, where, during winter months, there is a huge swim of tourists.
A bus shuttle delivers to him from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of the ski road is 45 km.
Ancient tradition suggests that pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You're not going to all for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are to visit.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Kumran manuscripts, or scrolls of the Dead Sea found in the Cave of the Judean Desert, and some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It should also be in the Tel Aviv Art Museum.
Its exhibits are widely featured by impressionists and expressionists Mone, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sysleia, Matissa, Modiljani, Shagala, Picasso.
At Acco, you can visit the Al-Bash Museum, which is a few courtrooms of the ancient Turkish bangs with the mules of visitors and banners of the time.
In Caisaria, we should go to the unique Part Museum of Rallie, where we can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Roden.
There's no tour guides and no souvenir benches.
The entry is free and no donations are categorically accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad-Your Museum in Tel Aviv, tells us about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section, the child memorial, is the memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you're in the absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
The names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Recovery
The three major resort zones of Israel are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each has basins, aquapartics, dolphinaria, and oceanry.
Interestingly, even during winter months, the Red Sea is bathed because the temperature of the water is not below 21 degrees Fahrenheit [21 degrees Fahrenheit] and the air is heating up to 23 degrees Fahrenheit [23 ° C].
The Dead Sea is warmer, and it has been swimming for a year.
By the way, this most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point of the world -- 417 metres below the ocean level.
The lazur water in it is a lubricant that holds the swimmers easily, even unable to swim at all.
Mapping around is unrealistic.
They go here to receive salt water treatment, rapes, and medicinal muds, and to cure their health in dermatites, allergies, asthmas, extrems, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar diabetes to get the order of the shattered nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Ancient Times
The ancient part of Tel Aviv, the city of Yaffo, is on the Mediterranean.
It was through the famous Marine Way, uniting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Persei saved Andromed’s beauty, with which they lived a long and happy life.
The tourists are very fond of swimming on the narrow streets named after Zodiak's marks.
They say if you touch the walls on the street, Fortuna will be favorable.
Youths who come from all Israel and even other countries to the photo session can be met in Yaffo.
And in Casaria, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusades.
During the Roman period, Kesariah was the principal city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
A carefully refurbished theater is now used for evening concerts and operas.
Tourist on Note
While traveling to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: about 30 per cent of the people in the country know Russian.
It is better to take the money to travel, not in euros, but in dollars that are easy to exchange for Sheqel (now US$ 1.8 to Shekel).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram, and in Haifa the only subway line in the country consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the Upper.
In fact, it's a underground funiculer.
All types of urban transport cover six shekels for which transplant can be travelled for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, the Sabbath is celebrated by Jewish tradition on Sabbath.
From Friday night to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transportation cease.
And Sunday morning begins a week's workday.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels are only kosher foods that exclude pigs, seafoods, fish without cemeteries and dishes that combine milk with meat.
It offers a large choice of baranine and beef, soup and desserts prepared on coconut milk, the traditional Jewish paste of the Humus, various sauces, hammer balls, falalal, fruit and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there's a lot of fed cats that're "wondering themselves."
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlines love people's places and do not give up their feasts.
Rental of a car, depending on the mark, would be from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance is $15 per day.
And a bicycle leak will cost you 15 shoes a day.
The museum tickets average up to 30 shekels.
Language of digits
In 2012, Israel visited over three million tourists from around the world.
The U.S., Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, Ukraine, and Russia were most likely to travel and rest.
On the Earth of the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 118,8,000 Ukrainian tourists visited, 51 per cent more than the 2010 equivalent figure, before the abolition of visas on 9 February 2011.
"Great and Powerful" to Moscow will prove that migrants are digging money into language
As long as deputies and human rights defenders argue that the law on mandatory language testing would give effect, fraudulents selling “Field” certificates had already emerged in the country.
In Moscow, Petersburg, and other Russia’s cities, 13 million Gastarbateters arrive each year.
Most of these are citizens of Middle Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left in the home.
Since 1 December, the law has entered into force that every migrant worker is obliged to pass an examination in Russian.
To date, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in services, housing and communal, household and retail trade.
In time, however, the PFP promises that the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
But not only the language, but also Russian history, and the basis of legislation.
Language knowledge will have to be confirmed both for receipt and for extension of work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is a public language.
There is no law, and people who have been successful in obtaining certificates and diplomas of education before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Benefits, predestination and protection of rights
The Network of Examination Points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian Language of Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, IHL, SPBGU and other Russian universities.
Migrant tests will be available in all cities; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The profiling initiative was supported by both the Deputies of the Home and the FMF.
And human rights defenders, before the law came into force, have asked the press a lot of times, what will it do?
What will change the need for language knowledge both for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, the migration service responds to this will reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery.
Very many are now talking about the protection of the rights of labour migrants, explaining the Russian FMS leader in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will 90 per cent address the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, in education that does not know a language without a medical examination.
Without understanding of the language, Sébelov is sure, the future migrants have to face unfair people who, under the form of help, will move their “travel” into a cramped, tight barrack where he and his dozens of such ones will spend months without food and paper, pulsing 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing in their homeland, and when they arrive they are deceived, taken passports, not paid the promised salary," confirms the Chief Director of Labour Migration of Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
Don't fight, fucker!
However, as long as many middle-Asian citizens who are working to Russia are recognized, not only do they not know the language of the country they seek, but they also find it difficult to write on their own.
Of course, it's not as much their fault as the trouble: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajikis can afford even an accurate primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, let alone wearing, dressing, and utilizing them to school.
As they reach teenagers, they are employed at the earliest opportunity.
It is hard for them to know the tongue, and they admit it.
"You feel humiliated and inappropriate."
Indeed, with regard to the law on the language of human rights defenders, one important point has been made.
Only those who have legal status will be tested.
If the status is not available, there will be no examination or subsequent official work.
In the meantime, most of the Gastarbyters continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Forbidden,"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic and still the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is worth between 12 and 16,000 rubles.
And then false registration can be made quickly and in just one and a half thousand years.
The Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, we don't have registration, that's where there's extortion.
"Please a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," he told the journalists, Umed Hudadamov citizen of Tajikistan.
"Fly out, don't be boring, buy painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that not only migrants ' registration documents were false.
Several "lip" test certificates for language testing have already been removed by FMS staff.
Fake papers are printed on a normal color printer.
Of course, they did not come to the new owners: each of the migrants who hoped to make it easier for themselves to perform the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
This is twice as expensive as the formal testing procedure: it will cost three thousand labour migrants.
That the main challenge for the short term is to protect the system against corruption, so that the "shorts" cannot be bought, both the authorities and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise to the gastralbeaters who have not been successful in the first test, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian visitors will be invited to work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry does not traffic in the illicit arms market
Proportion of legal weapons crimes is extremely low
The Ministry of Internal Oversight Services proposes to strengthen the law on civilian weapon owners.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: to shoots at weddings without casualties, and to kill, by Moscow Lawyer Dmitri Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit trauma in public places and raise the age from which a weapon licence can be obtained from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption of Irin Yarovya and promised that amendments to the Arms Law would be brought to the Lord in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to combat the problem by "gatekling".
An open letter has emerged on the network, whose authors, the representatives of the various civil small arms organizations, demand that they abandon “unreasonable tightening”.
The percentage of weapon-registered bullying was minimal, declared by the Russian BBC of the Criminal Lawyer Vasili Lesnikov.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs statistics, 142 firearms crimes were committed in six months of 2012, while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of civil weapons legislation does not place the offender in the black market.
Now, they said, any weapons at a low price can be found in Moscow.
In the meantime, in the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services, it is alleged that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The Black Market of Arms is being replenished through several channels.
The five main channels, says the Colonel in the resignation of Victor Baranzec, who has been in the structure of the Ministry of Education and Henstabe for ten years.
Screenshot of the hosting weapon site
The first is an Army or a military trace, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting on the Caucasus.
"The Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves have pulled out the outer,," says Barants.
The next type of black weapons is stolen by criminals from the forces.
The Baranitz explains that the police warehouses are both included and stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal "strokes" are being sold from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses have often experienced explosions.
"There are proven versions that part of the burns were made specifically to cover the shortage," said the former military.
According to Branz, the weapon manufacturers make their contribution.
“Private weapons plants are now being produced, which do not stand up for competition in the international market and throw weapons from underground to black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another black market source is smuggling.
Particularly numerous are pistols and rifles from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzsia.
"There's its own production, sometimes artisanal, and there's a mafia that has organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where's the weapon?
The experts considered the nearest share of each of the sources of illicit arms in the black market.
The report was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Oversight Services and Rostata, criminal literature and open portals on weapons issues.
Most of the illegal weapons are written by researchers, from the army and from the forces.
Half of all weapons in the black market were found there “for the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons”, as stated in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the cases of weapons originating from places of armed conflict, 14 per cent of the cases of weapons-producing attacks, 5 per cent of the cases of black archaeology.
The consultant seller of one of the weapons stores who asked him not to call him the name, assures us that the weapons found by black miners have been unpurchased for a long time, too old.
Most often, he says, for the new party, the sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through a banner, a person buys a unit, such as a gun TT.
He's being handed out and handed over through the fence.
"He's transporting it to town and selling it for $900 per thing with two stores," he says.
“Really, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically, when the plan for the disclosure of crimes is burning, the illegal arms dealers are under control,” adds the consultant.
"How's the luxury store?"
The seller and buyer are most commonly found through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites, blogging, until a friend who offered to come to the Bohevaya platform, where there's a man who's going to take me to the corner where we're going to trade.
The price of the trunk I only found out there.
Military observer Victor Baranzez
To get a gun, I need a friend who has a way out, says a consultant seller.
There are market sellers, but there's also a need to come, "from Ivan Ivanović, who asked me to tell her that she had a tooth falling out."
I'm even getting a couple of tapes right now through a man I'm sure of.
He's only giving them to me, too, because he knows I won't give it up.
Newborns are searching for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranzecus tried to be a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing an article on this subject for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photographs where everything was "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls the military.
According to Branz, the buyer does not offer a cat in a sack - you can try everything.
I'm a potential client, not just buying, we're going to the woods with a seller, we're putting a target.
"I'm allowed to shoot, and when I'm convinced that weapons are going well, we're starting to trade," the expert describes the procedure.
Magazine on the sofa
Internet searchers are sending to websites and groups at Vontact where they offer to buy weapons for different purposes.
No documents and personal meetings are required to do so.
"Sufficient to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertisement hat on the "Buy a gun or a machine."
The users leave their applications and ask questions thereon.
They're gonna sell to the minors?
"No licence, of course," asks Ivan user (orthography retained).
"T.Mosqua's Cupul" is concisely formulating the Fedorrenca request.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of base sites and those wishing to buy guns with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish to feed and then get a coal to Siberia.

I've heard about these schemes: usually the site is registered outside Russian law.
People get orders.
The buyer is paying for the bankrupt.
"In response, Dmitri Kislov, the Spokesman for Public Arms, sends a photograph and instructions.
Victor Barants claims that leaving the application on the website can be left without weapons and taken to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now dispersed a huge network of base sites and those wishing to buy guns with a shovel.
"People go like hungry fish to feed and then get coal to Siberia," he says.
Macarov for $100
Experts estimate that the amount of $100 to $900 can be invested in the purchase of illegal small arms.
According to Dmitri Kyslov of Arms, McArov's gun can be purchased for $100-300.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official stast of the department, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole declined by 7 per cent, compared to January to October 2011, to 22.9,000, while the number of incidents of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosives decreased by 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fastfud workers and supermarkets are boosted.
The Macdonalds work runs up to a quarter of all American teenagers.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart Corporation and restaurants of popular fast food networks such as Macdonalds, Burger King, Tako Bell, Wendis and Kentucky Fred Chicken.
Until no one predicts whether this wave will turn into a ninth wal or it will breathe in early stages.
The shares support trade unions and a number of left-handed social organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages earned by a number of Walmart employees and the rapid feeding system, the aim of protesters is to establish trade union organizations in them.
Until now, this sector of the economy is almost covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The actions started last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called Black Friday, when the United States was hit by a cheap sales orgy that captured millions of hunters and sometimes accompanied by patters.
On that day, some Walmart Corporation employees, with 2.2 million workers worldwide, left their jobs and peeked together with trade unions and left activists, the company's stores, whose goods are disposed of by people of modest and medium-sufficiency.
Walmart trades all in the world, from firefights, hunting guns and car batteries to dust, eggs and milk.
His stores averaged between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many of Walmart’s low-paid employees are abandoning their jobs alone.
The availability and assortification of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods in part because he pays little to his employees.
The latter also complain about the difficult conditions of work, such as the shortage of car loaders or hand scanners.
The shares in the Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and reported that the cost of the corporation ' s medical insurance had been paid from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour, that spending is not at all, they said.
Researchers at the University of California in Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises average wages to $12 per hour, it will cost a corporation of $3.2 billion.
It's about 1.1% more than she's spending on wages now.
If Walmart's entirely shifts the increase in payroll to buyers' shoulders, each visit to the store would cost them only 46 cents.
They're going to spend some $12.39 in a year more than now.
Walmart proponents suggest that protests took place in only nine states and did not cause corporations any slight damage.
"Black Friday" continued in her shops from eight o'clock on Thursday to midnight of the next day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 goods a second.
In total, its cash equipment was made on the Black Friday of almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the Corporation, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview with Huffington Post, that the jobs had left a total of “less than five” Walmart staff, and that the protest was the only “ordinary piar trick” of the trade union.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not the Walmart Universities (they are not complained in this progressive city, so they are not yet here), but the Macdonalds and other cheap restaurants.
McDonalds says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn't even give you hospitals or pays you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, New York City City member
At present, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaffers increase, but a little, and on average, their employees receive 8.90 dollars an hour in New York.
No one earns less in this dear town.
How you can live in New York for that kind of money, it's impossible for me.
At one time, the Makdonalds had almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their post-school counterparts while living with their parents.
Few saw the basic source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly struggling for an interview with Makdonalds employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, at the Wall Street Journal forum, the commentary, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Participants who started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at Makdonalds on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks pay at least 15 dollars an hour, more than doubled their current minimum earnings.
They also required the establishment of trade union organizations in the area of rapid nutrition.
The American Law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing the activists of the trade union movement with idlers and dismissals.
On the other hand, the Administration rarely makes life easier for them.
However, it is difficult to reach out to the union for objective reasons.
One of the mains is the unusual turnover of staff.
Inconsistent
Stupid protests took place on that day and in a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the stock was in the middle of the day at the Makdonalds meeting near Times Square, where several local democrat politicians spoke, in particular, a member of the Jumaine Williams horde who said, "Makdonalds" says he sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn't even give you hospitals and pays you for honest work!"
Demonstrants also supported other prominent New York democrats, such as the candidate for the Mayor of the City of Bill De Blasio, who stated that “we must be friendly in supporting fast-food workers in order to ensure that they attain fair pay and economic well-being, which everyone deserves in New York!”
As the New York Times described, this was the biggest act of this kind in the history of the American fast-food world.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, but not all of them were employees of a fast common drink where tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
To date, it is not clear whether this spark will produce a mass-mobile flame.
"When the brain is deceived, it's going to be medium."
Recently, the topic of complementary reality has been widely accepted among the adversaries of modern technology, mainly through the prism of special points.
First in the summer at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the relevant patent was also shown by Microsoft.
However, speaking to the head of the 3D group in the Campbridge Laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi, it is clear that the sculpture is a step for the scientists of this company.
They have the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, in general, what's your research team doing?
- We're interacting with machines, but we're trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind stuck in the mass at the stage of work with pixel on a flat screen, sometimes a thumb in it.
We would like to look forward to five to ten years in advance and foresee the dramatic changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost one Xbox today is not sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in sign management.
- What else is ahead of us?
- Although Kinect has moved to a physical level, many are still on a flat screen, sometimes 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system gets more data), and the output is not yet very good.
We're trying to change this, working on true three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including design.
We have to put the computer world into our physical world to make it more tangible.
To that end, however, we need to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all, these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice managers?
A popular thing, but do they overestimate it?
- He's definitely not a panacea, it's a matter of privacy, because he doesn't always want to tell others about his actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, for the purpose of managing devices in public places, we had a project where we were thinking about gestures, but not on the worn, but on such stiff, short.
The gestures were made not by the camera of the device but by a handwritten bracelet that fixed the movements of the bones and the muscles.
As long as it's large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the handcuffed hours.
But the future for mixed management, for example, the gesture+голос.
- How's that?
- Like, how would you ask me to pass this gasoline bank on to you?
You'll say it and show it at the same time.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to make users adapt to something that the car can or cannot now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual convergence.
I think in the near future, we will mostly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will enable us to define more precisely human reactions.
It can be laser sensors, for example, they give a good depth resolution, that's very important.
If you're talking about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what's your claim for modern cameras?
No permission, depth, or something?
- In principle, this generation is something that can be pushed away in our work on three dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get mega-pixels 8 at 1,000 s/s.
But it's not about the megawks themselves, it's as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us -- it adds to the designers of algorithms.
So you should remember not only the X and Y resolution, but also the Z.
The speed, the number of staff per second, is also very important.
Human movements are rather dynamic and the current 30 k/s are frankly low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betischez of our Redmond Laboratory made a touch on the controlled delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern sensors closer to the second (60 to 100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of people and machines.
I'd be very useful in my work for the equivalent of this device, only that I don't need to have more staff per second.
- You don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- In Kinect, there are three cameras, one of which is actually an infrared radiation and the other is a reflective signal receiver.
And then the third camera is actually the normal sensor of the visible range.
It is not applicable to determining the depth of the object.
A potentially larger number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount.
It would be advisable to create a flexible analog of Kinect, to play with the camera curves, and to see how this will help in a three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present her glasses to the public.
You don't think, from the point of view of the day-to-day use of the technology of the complementary reality of the glass is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, keeping the smartphone in your hands up, it's not very comfortable, but that's what I think is that the coolest option would be the "transitional" complementary reality, when on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch from the points to the smartphone, the projection display and beyond.
The glasses are a very personal device, which is their strength (private things only see you) and the weakness -- an added reality based on points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only available to Tony Stark of the Iron Man, but also to a mortal man.
There is one problem that criticisms often point to: There is no tactical answer!
The hands don't feel anything!
What are your responses to this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that the complementary reality is the seventh breakthrough in human interaction and the car.
I think the eighth may be a tactical supplement.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is using the other hand as a kind of subpoena for the image.
She's very good at pushing!
But there's technology that really aims to give these pictures in the air -- for example, interfering a number of ultrasound beams at a certain point where your finger is, it makes a sense, but as long as it's very weak -- as if you're on the pillows.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect neural ends in their fingers, too, a promising direction.
- Did you try to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another challenge that is to be fought for a long time — to force a person physically in a very limited space to believe that he is going through open, almost infinite work and on concepts of runway tracks (also not like clubs), moving platforms and huge balls.
As long as the brain is being deceived, work has been done for many years.
That's what makes the virtual reality so attractive to the researcher -- many things in a totally start-up state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
The Rosbalt is continuing the Petersburg Adhard project, which focuses on the citizens ahead, in the advance of culture and art.
The top list has already witnessed the vivid artists of Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, past all Russian knowledge.
The new Rosbalt hero is an epathy artist, Cyril Miller.
The whole city is known by Cyril Miller, a man who is wearing all the red clothing that occurs at the Russian Museum, and at the Summer Garden, and at the fashioned party and the vernisajas.
The paintings of Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators wherever they go.
Cyrill Miller is one of the purely peterburg social and philosophical storytellers, who create new mythology.
Cyril Miller is a brilliant man of the Petherburg advance of the late '80s, the beginning of the '90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, by his appearance on the streets of a smile to the citizens, which raises the mood for everyone.
Recently, he took into his hands the scarmancake and became a petherburg ballmanner, since he was ripe for this difficult role by all his divine existence, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why are you still walking around the city in all the red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I picked red as a designer of the species and the image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between an artist, an imagemaker and a society.
Although everything that is slightly gray in society is causing aggression and incitement of badness.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative action is an invitation to the discussion.
- When did you realize that you should be an artist?
- At the Nevsky DC exhibit where my work was put.
I realized it was my way.
Then the wave of old free informal artists passed, and the new, free types of me were unclear.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazone girl that led to the Puskin 10, and there was no more wave.
I'm thrown into theater, dress, music, all the genres but a word.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of the culture of Petersburg, where all the best creative powers must be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied territory in Pushkina 10, and there was a music and art club, a godmother club, a house of the Peterburg godem.
Many were born there: NOM, Tequila-jaz, I remember Schnoura being brought with the Uho Wang Gog project.
The corn and his friends sang light songs under the fan, they were in the tightest three, among them the fashionable composer, Igor Wovin.
When the group played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programmes prior to the Khali-Galian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and we went to his great career, and basic education and education we had.
"D 137 Gallery," the Griboid Club is the art-clinics bands.
Our employees and all-time workers left there.
I'm a hero of last century when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, and the prize was "People of Our City."
In the nomination of the Year's Clock, I was called, and my culmination ended.
In new times, it's uncomfortable to work under old rules, I'm a human of truth, honesty, and culture of last century.
Nowadays it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are shared, can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is characterized by what you know.
- A lot of my paintings are huits, they're highly relevant and sharp.
I'll have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a modern category.
I've been social before, now being like this is hurt and scared.
But in the clowns, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace through totalitarian reeducation in order.
Now they meet on their clothes, not on the inside, but on the outside mechanics.
Maybe you can't give him a hand in the face.
And the deceit will be removed by reeducation.
And recently we saw you as a city sharkman, and the cultural city must have such a hero.
Who, I don't know, will be them.
- Maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art now has to be careful, tactical, sweet.
Cultural disintegration is going.
In the past, people fought in rods, the godem one loved, the prostitutes were the other.
But now everyone's broken into the microcommunications, and it's hard to like everyone.
I'm not a worthy paper so everyone likes it.
Now we have to think who you like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Mikhail's got a few thousand on the Stas!
- He's got broods, he's got sex and social work done.
And on cultural grounds 300 people will come and 10,000 won't come, and eventually less management, money, everything will choke.
I have some worshipers, and the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin what you've earned.
I've been writing paintings such as one of the collectors on the wall next to Falk and Larion's hangings.
I started with paintings that usually end.
Nowadays, the concepts are often confused.
They say that the culture is spiritual, the culture of consumption.
There's no culture of consumption, it's from another opera.
I am a culture man last night, I grew up in the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, relinquished money for painting painting paintings.
I'm a culture like this.
- Cyril, what's Petersburg's shortage?
- Good cultural experts.
There's this notion: A government official from culture.
But not all of them can learn culture.
In the case of the right kings, the kings may not have understood much in their culture, but they realized that they needed to keep the right experts.
There's good consultants in Moscow right now.
We have people in Petersburg who could be experts, but they're strangled, because we need higher experts to evaluate these experts correctly and give them the way.
Now the taste is flourishing.
The same Erart, but they're distinguished by what they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's soil.
It's hard to grow on our stones.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, it's wrong.
There's a lot of people in Europe who are curious. They're going to exhibits, concerts.
We've got this layer of thin.
We need to make fashion art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented on St. Petersburg grants
Birth in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or clashing with killer asteroid.
A spacecraft carved with landmen on board is taken to search for a spare planet.
To preserve humankind, there is a fundamental question: how can we continue to be born in a state of indifference or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be learned at least hypothetically.
“This is Venus and Mars,” considers Vladimir Surdin, Senior Scientific Officer of the State Astronomical Institute of P.C. Sternberg (GAIS).
But if the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the venere is a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in venere orbit... in space.
Reproducing in space began with flora.
Half a century ago, there were experiments on plants.
Four generations of orbited peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then, the release in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies, drosophile.
In 1979, the eggs of intersection were sent to outer space to check how the embryo develops under the conditions of inexorableness.
We're getting a perfectly normal baby outlet.
And then the problem begins.
“The problem that this bird has to find back to its legs and start moving”, explains RAN Vladimir Sitchev, lead laboratory of the Institute of Medicine and Biological Problems (IMBP).
Without resilience, the birds were rubbish.
After ten hours, the newborn had a full instinct.
Birds did not react to light and sound.
And the trouble was there that they were just dying in the four days.
"And twice we kicked out the birds, and then we refused because it was simply impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Schichev, a failure of the experiment with the birds in space.
The last time the biological "minicczeg" flew in orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, the biosatellite Bion will only be one-sexed.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent to space with fetus already.
In fact, they found nothing supernatural.
"It was on biosatellites, but once again, it's a single experiment, and such research has to be done," notes Vladimir Siczev.
After landing, there was a descendant from space rats.
But approaching the reproduction problem directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not easy.
Animals, while losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike beasts, can in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
For ethical reasons, no such experiments are conducted.
But women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was at Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humankind has is the female organism.
Our Teika flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would continue to fly into space.
Does she dare to give birth to a child after that flight?
"No one answered this question," says the Wahtang Wachcade, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just one year after the space flight, Valentine Tereshkova's first cosmonaut gave birth to her daughter.
Andrian Nicolai’s child’s father was also an astronaut.
In 1988 a son was born in Svetlana Savika, a second female cosmonaut, who had been in orbit twice and even in outer space.
However, the risk remains.
We don't have enough, we have a number of astronauts that have gone through long flights, and there's a great generation growing.
"And if more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," the result is the cosmonaut pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia, Valerius Polakov.
Still, humankind needs to find new ways in biotechnology, protection against radiation, artificial gravity.
CPC hydrolaboratory is a mandatory phase of flight preparation.
Here, in a zero-floating environment, astronauts develop the skills of work in outer space.
Water simulates vagueness.
If for adults the water is comfortable, but still strange, then for breastfeeding, it's kind of natural.
Little tytytyanders like to confirm that life on the land came out of the ocean.
There's a link between a baby being in its mother's obesity for about nine months, and it's easier to get used to the water.
In principle, that's logical because from the moment of birth, from that first bath, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says the breast-feeding instructor Marina Axenov.
In the words, if the natural state of the child born is more natural, the force of gravity is needed for the woman.
The muscles of the belly, the pelvis, and the ability to extract the fetus, fall very quickly in the wedge.
All right, let's drop it, relying on kinship stimulants.
You can, of course, go to a special cell to give birth to him, she'll push him out.
"And then what?" asks Valerie Polyakov the unrestrained questions.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without a sense of gravitation, the body will not form a skeleton or a muscle system.
A newborn in orbit cannot wear a special training suit as an adult.
He will simply be deprived of what is vitally necessary.
"And this experiment that we're going to do with you, by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead us to bring a disabled, completely disaffected person to the Earth," the leader of the Bioethics Committee RAN Igor Pesta.
While the birth of children in space is a theory question.
However, the time later will be real when the landings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will be a home for their descendants born in space.
Chief of the Chief Audit and Audit Office: The checking of the sewage system failed because of the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, Czech authorities have good controls and, despite the availability of qualitative legislation, have lagged behind its application.
This statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice-President of the High Audit Office, from an interview to the Aktuáln.cz site.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which I believe we lack”, commented on the current situation of Kala.
Such opinions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of misconduct, Peter Caughty's approach to the so-called sweat system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Curriculum Democratic Party) would not be concerned by the entrepreneurs with verifications - is it prohibited or permitted?
“The law should be established in any way, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister may not be able to resist the work of the institutions that are required to verify and seek to fulfil the obligations”, states Kala.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which legislation on State procurement of both countries was compared.
What was it about?
It's about parallel checks that we started, probably, two years ago.
More simply, European legislation asserts how public procurement should be conducted, followed by national legislation, and then applied in practice.
All the information has been collected and, even in the course of an unfinished verification, interesting differences have been found - simply to say, we may have "correct and unmistakable" legislation, but in the practice of applying some of the parameters we give to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more clarified rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And how does this project really help you know what it means to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the refinement of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because that does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means receiving the appropriate value for a reasonable (but not always a low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behaviour.
But it's not the fact that we're going to do that by lowering the demands.
This system may be filled with papers so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system will find them much easier than if the limitation did not decrease.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there an organization like our CIA (Control and Audit Office) there, or does it work differently?
In the case of institutions, Bundesrechnungshof, as our CIA, is also a panel that works a little differently, but mostly both institutions are functioning similarly.
In addition, the powers are to some extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, that is, the audit units and the federal land levels, their system is slightly different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have public means.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Chambers of Accounts.
As to local legislation, it's easier there than we do?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said definitely that it is best in all.
Is that because they're better at control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any advantage from cooperating with our office, would they?
In terms of domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your establishment, in any way?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short enough, it has not yet been shown in our monitoring work.
Since we are monitoring the facts, there is a need to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future audits -- we started using our new tool, "the detection of the risk of inequality", through which we passed almost 14,000 government contracts, and we analysed them, and of course, these changes will be manifested there, because restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing, and so on.
Do you believe that the adoption of this law will benefit or increase the pressure on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that might arise is that the rules will “intense” and cannot be respected.
In the preceding rules, controlled enterprises are linked to a supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with a regional council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in such a way?
I don't think this is the way.
The system must exclude those who want to seize and abuse but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how do we get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the DGP would not bother entrepreneurs with the so-called sewage system.
"Shoot system" is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be established in any way and, if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies that were required to verify and seek to fulfil the obligations.
You can say, "We're going to change this law and allow it," but you can't say we're pretending nothing's going to happen.
The Public Procurement Act contains some strict rules, as and what must be formally implemented, and that is correct, which will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal weaknesses.
The law will never be perfect, but it must apply correctly, which I think we do not have.
The roads are slippery, but mostly through.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowed.
Basically, they're coming, but in some places with more caution.

This morning, the roads in Carlovare were passed, but some of them were frozen and snowed.
Temperatures fell from five to ten degrees below zero, but a slight heat during the day.
The snowfall in the region ceased, with a small layer in the lowlands alone.
However, the ridges of the Red Mountains lie about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to information received from regional road workers, there was a lower visibility because of the mist.
The R6 highway and the first class roads in the region are currently being held without restrictions.
However, carefulness is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface may be frozen and slippery.
All roads of Class II and Class III, including the mountain tracks, are also in progress.
But some of their areas still have the frozen remnants and the places where the snow is set.
Especially should we be attentive on high roads.
Pardubitz and Kraloviegradek
The Office of Czech Roads and Highways informs on its Internet pages that some roads in eastern Czech Republic are in danger of starving, while mountain roads and high roads may be on snow traffic.
Regional road workers warn drivers of a holode that can be formed especially at the heights of the Pardubitian edge.
Hollyde may be near Lanscrown, Usti-nad-Orlitzi, Policies, Sweetavi or Viscue-Mito, especially on the second and third-class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located in Swetawa are treated by chemicals.
The snow is especially on the roads of Krconosche and the Orlic Mountains.
The snow intake is on high roads in the Richnova and Trütnova areas.
In Eastern Czech Republic, it's a variable cloud without precipitation today.
Temperatures usually range from negative three to plus one degree Celsius, a light wind.
Plzene
The roads in the area of Plsen are passed this morning, but places need to be cautious and adapted to the weather.
In the morning, the temperature varies from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places may be slippery.
Victims may encounter fog, but the visibility will gradually improve.
Regional road workers provided information.
The D5 highway is now almost unlimited, but the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometres.
Most of Class I roads have dry and frozen surfaces.
South Plizni and Takhov may have frozen areas.
The roads of Class II and Class III are wet, and there is also a warning on the possibility of sliding sites.
Drivers must be careful, especially on low-used roads in the Shumawa area.
The Land of Olomouse
The drivers headed to the highlands of Olomousz must today take into account the snow porridge on the road.
It remained following the use of chemicals in the Black Sea Sedle and on the road towards Vidhel Krshij.
In the night of the snow, road workers were forced to walk outside, according to road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Shumperk.
In other areas the roadside is usually unrestricted.
"On the heights of the Shumper are the remains of the snow.
The drivers headed towards Esenica must bear in mind the presence of a snow porridge in the Red Sedle,” reported today to the CHAN (Czech Agency of News) the шумperk road control manager.
At night, their colleagues from Esenica went to clear the roads and assured them that the highways had remained naked and wet after the processing of chemicals.
In the Olomoust roads are unlimited, but drivers in Sternburk must be attentive to forest sites, where still humidity remains.
The Uzk land, the country of Librez
Today, road workers from northern Bohemia report that a few difficult passages are left.
According to the police database, in addition to several spots with naked or falling snow, a mountain road is closed in a section from the Hotel in the Ustec province.
The temperature also remains negative in the lowlands, so the roads maintain snow and ice. In lowlands, especially south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, there are no problems, mostly dry roads.
Road complications are not yet reported.
Road workers report the appearance of a Hollow in the area of Stetti.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for his education at night - the whole day was raining and shading snow, the night sky cleared and the freezing began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main highway and on track I/13 at the borders of the Ustek and Librez border.
Because of the snowy branches of the road itself, it was forced to close the road in Telnica in the Book.
Shimon Ornest: at concerts, we want to accumulate positive energy.
What do you think less than a month is the end of the world?
It's just one of the many disturbing news that we people get so easy on.
Together with the The Tap Tap group, we're constantly joking on this subject and we're saying that we're the only group in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Would you like to tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fund-raising event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing capacity of the Maya calendar, the end of which was announced on 21 December at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20th, at 9:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrave are in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose 12 - hour belt is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who thought that idea?
It was originally my idea, and then we all made up with our artist, Gonza Augusta.
Beyond the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to consider, together with the public, the state of this world we will once pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of shoe, shirt, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, thereby providing support.
The Tap Tap group, together with other musicians, also performed a hymn against the end of the world, which is called "Light End Cancels".
Will the hymn that has already been loved to the YouTube audience at these Benefits concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if everything comes and the end of the world does not come.
He's sung all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The gymnas are also called in a direct air of Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played by Jesus in the clip of Tomas Ganak, also in Xindl X....
How did you start working with them?
We also collaborate with other individuals in Czech cultural life, as we are conducting many charitable events and concerts.
We're trying to actively connect them to these projects.
It turns out that many people like working with us, they're curious.
What's going to be the benefit of a concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO Free Education Centre, we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlička Institute for the sixth year.
Teachers regularly visit Edlicka school students and conduct fun and interesting events with them.
Students themselves have no means to go to teachers, and we're thus trying to give them this opportunity.
As part of the Edlicka additional construction project, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project in the future.
There will be a few musical groups and performers at each concert.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to draw up a programme that is of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango, and Irgy Suhi.
For all details, see www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grandways” in the future?
In May, we're going to make our first presentation at the Prague Spring and, of course, here to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be pleased to have a presentation at the Czech National House in New York, and I would like to speak in Washington and Chicago personally if we were in the United States.
With regard to the border, you've had serious plans, you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the way of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs are to travel in the baggage compartment, plus a lot of cargo and boxes with tools.
The Czech airways and the British British Airways airlines have always been very well prepared for us, and I have been amazed for many times.
Even in Moscow, where we came from recently, everything went without a problem.
As a result of travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations with persons with disabilities, and so forth.
What have you been facing up to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we do, we have witnessed in Russia that we are still at the baseline in the east.
Compared to Prague in Moscow, there are very many barriers, and there is still an autonomous human movement on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there's no banal stuff on the elevator's way.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
On the contrary, what should be our constant need to reach out to the leading countries?
There are a lot of things that are far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it's normal that people with severe disabilities move themselves on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in public life, and that's what we're doing with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier is one thing, but when we have known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then things will really change.
As long as it's unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but let's go back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to Edlicka's institution as a tutor, and there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician and I'm playing the saxophone, I've organized an interesting musical circle with my colleague.
Well, in time, as our leader Lady Angelović says, it's a little out of control.
The popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
That's true, we've been helped by the fact that we've started joining the famous singers and working actively on the propaganda of the group.
We have concluded that work that no one can evaluate is essentially as if there were no work.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so forth.
Was your goal so good to twist the Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential to do something extraordinary.
There's a lot of things in Shaw business that imitate each other.
This is logical, all new is accepted with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, is pity, that's natural...
But this pity is completely out of the way, because people with disabilities are not some kind of suffering and all the abandoned individuals that we must regret.
They are people who can live full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disabilities have something to do, it has shifted not only to them but to the whole society.
Have you succeeded in being a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do our work qualitatively, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic outlook and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that they have to go to rehearsal, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they're very quick to lose enthusiasm.
But that's what happens in any group that wants to work and do something.
The Tap Tap Tap is currently composed of twenty.
How many were early in 1998?
Just one Ladja Angelović.
We're an open group, people come and go away, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the will and the power of will, our doors are always open.
It will be held day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012, at 21.00.
The conference will be held at Incheba Stadium in Prague, in Brno at Fléda and Ostrava, in the centre of Plynojem, with the participation of 12 groups and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by television at the time the song of The Tap Tap "Light Ends."
The project aims to fund 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunction barber-free equipment for the STUDEO educational centre at the Edlicka Institute in Prague.
It's 400 kroner tickets, it's free for children under the age of 12, and you can buy tickets in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at a ministerial meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former eastern bloc (after Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland had initiated close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and had actively participated in a number of agency projects over the years.
But the way to space Poland started a lot earlier.
Prior to World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always understood.
I recall, for example, Lecture A. Sterfelda, which presented ideas at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933 from its innovative work “Introducing to Space”.
The ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, and after several years, Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won Robert Esno-Peltra and André Luis Hirsch for the introduction to space.
Dr. Jan Hadomsky (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great astronomer of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a number of books on these science disciplines.
Hadomsky became a world-renowned astronautist, and his contribution was appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the back of the Moon was named in his honor.
As early as 1925, a rocket - driven railway was built in Poland.
Regrettably, the author of the idea remained unknown, as was the details of the project.
It's not clear even that a missile was to be used to disperse or braking the trolley.
Information about this drift is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery has begun to think about missiles.
The Study was carried out by the Arms Section, in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfke and Gustave Mokzitski.
The remaining materials show that the studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of the German forces, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the Specialized Press introduced the idea of an explosive photoelectric missile proposed by the engineer Rogozinski, and next year, the work of the Lelivi-Kivoblock Missile and Aeronautical Missile was launched.
Both projects were designed for the military use of missile engines.
The Tymczasowy Komitet Doradzo-Naukowy (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradzo-Naukowy) coordinated all the work before the war itself.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its work, it ended because of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on astronauts appeared in the post-war Polish press, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystvo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, we refer to society in the November 1954 issue of the magazine “Astronautics”, which publishes four extensive astronautic articles.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotović proposed to organize a society that would engage in astronautics.
At the time, artificial satellite projects were already on track, and it was clear that space research was a forward-looking industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautics Society (POA) has attempted to join the International Federation of Astronautics (based in 1951) and has already become a valid member of the AAA autumn.
In the following year, the first Chairman of the PCA, Kazizizimer Záranquević (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained at that position until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, PPA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
A rocket capable of crossing the distance of 1,800 m was about 80 cm long and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of RM-1A was constructed and a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested in the summer of 1959 on the Blaedov desert.
The rocket was about 1.4 m long and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could travel 14.5 kilometres, and its task was to monitor the high wind.
But further development was suspended in 1962.
The Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965 was the heir of the first RM missiles.
The rocket was designed to be two-step, its total length was 510 cm and its initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from the size of the cell for scientific equipment.
The rocket Meteor-1A had a space of 0.4 L, Meteor-1B 0.34 L and Meteor-1C 0.62l.
The maximum flight distance of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute developed a Meteor-2 rocket and its first summer tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket, with a start weight of 380 kg, was able to carry the useful cargo with a weight of 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then constructed.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ' s entry into COSPAR (Space Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, under the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermasevsky became the second intercosmonauth after Vladimir Remec.
The repeal of the Public Work Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court revoked the Law on Public Work.
The decision led to a lively debate in society.
Clearly, it would be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberian economic systems in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This relates to the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of private capital, together with unconditional financial speculation.
As a result, a significant difference in the cost of the labour force (wages) is due to price stress.
This concept should be understood when the producer, through the delivery of the cheap goods, is trying to stand up in economic competition by “turning” the value of the competitor to take away most of the market and thus increase his own income.
This means largely for most entrepreneurs either moving overseas or cheap procurement overseas or disappearance, resulting in higher unemployment in countries where labour costs are higher than others.
Since private capital was not responsible for any social responsibility, including unemployment, the State ' s inevitable spending on social needs was increasing.
In general, the situation exacerbates the unwillingness of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the social and social damage they have suffered in the pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital have created a situation at the level of economies of individual States where Governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, Governments give their own population to private capital deficiencies, despite social deterioration.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the legislation in force.
The goal is to economically force its people to submit to the dictatorship of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting the rights of employees in labour law.
As a result, poverty and the difference between the poor and the rich are increasing.
In the FIU for several years, there has been public distribution of food to the poor who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is approaching a million.
As a result of improving the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases in which employees receive such wages that the State must pay to obtain a minimum of living.
This scandal has also been known to the public in the case of additional workers in Bundestag.
Economic measures in virtually all southern EU States undoubtedly result in the same situation in which people under pressure from a catastrophic fall in social status are forced either to emigrate, as in the 19th century, or to live on poor wages at the outskirts of society, in the hope that private investment will ever come into the country.
But you're wondering where he's going to come from.
If capital comes from other EU countries, poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, Africans are still working for the share of European wages.
This is true in Latin America as a whole.
The liberal theory and the media claim that the State is unable to participate in the capital of its own economy, which is the result of an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the State should not interfere with the economy.
Further, the question should be asked whether private capital, which is now almost the ruler of policies and the whole State, is operating for its own selfish purposes.
Unequivocal answer is yes.
The existence of virtually all-mighty and widespread lobbies in all States is evidence.
As a result, we have a disproportionate situation in corruption, mutual benefit in legislation where almost everyone deserves punishment but is not a crime.
The situation in the FRF is that government ministries, owing to the lack of funding, are instructing private legal firms to draft bills that are tightly linked to industry.
These bills then approve Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as stated in the Western Constitution, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-orientated democracy is now rapidly emerging in a situation described by Appian in the “Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompei”: “The State has long been dissolved and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving of graces with stones and swords.
The breeding and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold voice " ...mankind people did not at all ballot to the position of ruler, after all, one day the State remained without a consul for eight months. ". " Seriously, the only salvation in this terrible situation is the self-state and the need to choose an energetic human being. "Appian thought that this would be Pampay, but it became Caesar, who had finally replaced democracy with self-government.
As in ancient times, modern society has its own unreasonable interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended to be used for public purposes.
The current outcome is not different from the past: the unprecedented fall of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
So the reason for the fascist and Communist regimes is that we must look for a foolish liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, followed by the next tour.
First of all, it is tragic that the present elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of future victims, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we already witness, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Law on Public Work is not a decision or at least not for all.
Under pressure from competition at both the international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to seek ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
The trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the State's participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the administration of the State and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"With violence nothing can come out, and never can go out" - Sting, "Lord song," where the main verse of the refrench is, "We don't forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons hadn't wanted wars, they wouldn't have been" is the dying Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Meer Amshel Rotchild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as usual, raised many responses.
Some advocate Israel, argumenting its position that it is entitled to self-defence, while Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians by reasoning with the racist State of Israel, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on who, in these recurring waves of murders, was the perpetrator and who, ultimately, the victims of today's Israeli citizens, including self-government, were born at the time of the current political situation and were not witness to the beginning of violence.
My goal is to invite readers to look at the curtain, to see who is first of all served by the 95-year-old tension (due from the signing of the Balfura Declaration in November 1917) on a small portion of the land of the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or who are the main engines of modern history.
The history of humankind is first and foremost a history of power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
It is not so clear whether these people have always taken their own steps, or whether they have been behind their throne by someone who has guided their action towards the intended goals.
It should be assumed that we are living at a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and the power that stems from it could not occur for one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families is one that could be seen as the head of the stroke (I don't know whether someone's worth it, but it's not excluded) - Rotchilds.
They don't write much about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) has purchased in the 1990s since the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name to criminal acts in the highest areas of the shadows of which they were, and which have always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or both.
They have large stockpiles in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were five countries, and only four remain after the eruption of the Kadhafi, but at the same time the Russian Government took its central bank into its own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rotchild’s Bank of America, and during the civil war he began to release his own (see - governmental) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to release his own money and wanted to cancel FED (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963, and the Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to bring to justice the FED for the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their aspiration for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for the three world wars established by the great Masoon of the 33rd level by Albert Pyke.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchic States in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially of Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion (this number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume much resources), the establishment of a single universal religion (ecumenism could be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families headed by Rotchilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer of solutions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of FED, which should have prevented the recurrence of the crisis that they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to unleash the First World War by killing the Gabsburg heir of Ferdinand's Austria-Hungarian throne in Sarajevo, they destroyed the royal Russia by beginning a greaterist revolution.
The first world war ended with a sudden, unfounded military and economic capitulation of Germany (hereinafter, no need of war to destroy the royal Russia) and, as a result, the dissolution of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary, took place.
To facilitate the commencement of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge military reparations on Germany, rather than the prerequisite for the radicalization of the depleted masses, then only to give the Germans a sufficiently strong, pronouncing the perpetrators and offering simple decisions to the Leader, to further establish a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority to play, and has indeed played a role in the fifth colonnium in the incitement of a fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rotchildas provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one of which sought to establish a Jewish State, preferably in the area of historic Judea and Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfura Declaration created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish State as a global community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany had been brought into force by military reparations for the Second World War, the State of Israel had been proclaimed to create a third war burial.
If international bankers are able to unravel it, the Jewish people, like the second world war, will become victims of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos not only inside the country but also at the international level (only a sharp division of people into the supporters and opposers of Israel).
Who is responsible, and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment is in an endless chain of violence, if all begins with the greed and aspirations of individuals to world power?
There is a need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we do, international bankers encourage people to vote in elections solely for their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international politician banker, who is doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Pakistan, Pakistan) will threaten to break into the world conflict, and given Iran ' s control over the Ormuz Strait containing 20 per cent of all world oil stocks (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words of David Rockfeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
The new world order in their submission is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy that enjoys comfort.
A world where every birthable organism implants a chip with which it becomes a person under total control.
"And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, so that the man who is not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name cannot sell.
That is the wisdom. Anyone with understanding can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and it is the number of six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo" film: When there's nowhere worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist Demand Students captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and hostaged 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown chess of Mohammed Reza Pehleva, who had fled after the United States revolution, which had been the guardian of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration, the positive outcome of the situation was not expected to be -- she couldn't afford to throw a chess overboard, because it might have undermined the trust of allies in other countries.
However, the liberation of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, was unable to do so.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failure to release hostages by force.
Detainees of diplomats were finally released 444 days after negotiations with the Algerian Government's mediation.
Their destiny has caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran disposition at home.
The defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential elections, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, renounced by an actor by Ben Afflek, “Argo Operation”, describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America the little victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy, six employees had escaped.
After the complex peripeties, they finished their journey to Canada’s residence of the Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in withdrawing them from Iran, with an extravagant cover legend that they had moved into Canada's passports as members of a survey group seeking a place to take up a science and fantastic era.
Combining of genres
The plan that the expert on evacuation, Tony Mendes, demanded Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the legend to be credible, the specialized journals had written about the project of the film , and press conferences were organized, and the derivative company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, a film based on tony Mendes memoirs.
Affleka's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political triller, the so-called “film-kinoopus”, a story of a good idea, an affair, might be an example of a series of films about the friends of Ouschen.
The film is constantly changing the moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the tips show marking historical photographs of events and how the same situations have been demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, the lightened Hollywood passages crossing with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions -- men in suits discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations, at the staircases of institutions, on the telephone...
Ben Afflek has made a great career restart.
From the ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and his game stopped being the object of ridicule.
Operation Argo's third full film, after a dark detective, "Goodby, Baby, farewell" (2007) and "The City" Triller (2010).
At the same time, it's the first Afflek film that's not filmed in the hometown of director Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place, however, relates to the qualities that raised the earlier films of the director over the Hollywood Standard.
And Afflek shows it in Argo where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are reconstructed, the embassy's opening scenes are impressive, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and uncertainty that arise when history suddenly changes.
The similar effect of Afflek and his colleagues is achieved in the scenes of the fabricated (false headquarters on the Tehran market).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative did not imply many exciting scenes of cinematographic significance.
He's pretty successful with this little thing, and sometimes he thinks something -- it's not that elegant -- the price in which the American phone call prevents the impending crisis at Tehran Airport, and the race on the airstrip looks pretty obscene.
“Argo” is a lack of vagueness, with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood's colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they're not the only ones in the film.
Afflek's film lacks a little dramatic, it's a film that can be seen with moderate interest, evaluating the design and retro-stile that reproduces the seventieth trillers.
But it's hard to catch.
This is, however, sufficient for a reminder of one, still known in the sense of living history, as well as to show how the ideas of all-mighty and all-knowing special services are exaggerated.
Rules for air balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the EU workshop."
“The Us has led to this recent event in which the EU is planning to adopt a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of major European companies”, stated the “Right” of the interviewer Patrick Nager.
Among the already nominating absurdities is the recent decision of the European Court to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
Women still had life insurance benefits because they were objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
"The further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be put forward by the end of the year.
The vote itself will take place before the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The EU disputed orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which is harmful to nature, and the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury degrees only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or a directive on the size of the chicken cell, resulting in significant travel of eggs this year.
Also criticized was the actual prohibition of the use of the term “butterbродous oil” or the removal from the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas shall be 14 centimeters long.
The Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are generally protected by a State or group of States (such as the Czech Republic now defends the demands of its banks even under threat).
The interests of lobby are: for example, the highest-quality bananas in the European Union were to reach lengths of 14 cm and did not have the courage to display “anomalous criterion”.
In doing so, the European Commission was justified by harmonizing existing divergent national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, had mitigated the standards for fruit and vegetables, recalling that existing directives would lead to the planting of products.
A candidate for winning in the survey may be the EU's last year ' s decree that the sold balloons must be warned that children under the age of eight cannot attack them without adult supervision.
The EU has studied the United States where air balloons at play are a potential cause of death by suffocation.
This limitation now extends to children under the age of 14 who are prohibited from wearing a barrack.
Funny ideas are also born at home
The rule concerning European officials is sufficiently absurd: everyone who has a official position in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia, given the delicateness of the topic for Greece, and should instead say “BURM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, Laissez Faire, proposed to vote, in addition to several of the absurd rules mentioned above, for example, the EU Food Stocks Rule in the Territory of the Member State.
The EU has established the maximum supply of food that can be found in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, Czech Republic exceeded, for example, its fixed amounts of conservative mushrooms, for which she was in danger of being fined.
The interviewers were also interested in paying some countries for their lack of seas, and the idea of granting grants for grants.
But those ideas came up in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are in a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation”, declared in autumn 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas.
He argued that the country had a high crop of grain and that the so-called intervening procurement had provided the State with full stockpiles that had to be delivered.
For being far away from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from landlocked countries.
Subsidies for subsidies were offered to villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, led by the Minister Paul Nemz (US-DEU), inter alia, to make an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Exclusive orders are an exception
While decisions in Member States are easily criticized, EU efforts to regulate, as well as to improve the functioning and development of the European Union, many experts believe that more should be recognized.
In the view of the experts, it is a serious problem to draw EU substantiation for projects that have not even a general idea of deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the discussion of the budget.
Emotion among Czechs and that, as in other European countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to the specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name Olomoutsk cheese, but the Thames rum, whose traditions in our country are rooted in the 19th century, had to be renamed Tozemak.
Only foods from the reeds, not from the sugar can be called romine, can be used as romine.
The official list of EU registered products, together with globally known “feta” and “horgondzela” raw materials, a marcipan from the German Lubek or Parma branch, has already been found, for example, Carlovary sugars, mining and treshebon carp and gretz hmel.
In addition, the EU may be proud of the perfume and tube.
People want me to protect the Republic, but I'm an amateur, says Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head of a presidential ballot?
I don't think of becoming a senator or president myself.
If we'd had everything in the country without problems, I wouldn't have been running.
But I can't see over the past 20 years, the country has been screwed up, the thieves, the taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, I'm trying to find a solution how to change it.
And since I have been forty years old and I am an independent person who is not a party, I have no other opportunity to influence things except to ballot on the Senator or President's post.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the presidential castle.
Do you thus turn back to the people who chose you?
I've always said that I'll be involved in the struggle for the presidential castle, depending on the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I clarified that if I was chosen by the senator, I would be running for the presidents.
My goal is not to be a post; the post is a tool by which I can carry out my views.
I therefore need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the challenge is not only that we're as a nation chirping at our own bar or TV, but they're ready to break down every one who tries to change something.
This is added to the media, which neglig the human being, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For example, I was told that I was bribing journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgy Paroubek.
Let's go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the ideas of substantive and criminal responsibility of politicians and of reverse property declarations amounting to over 20 million.
To do so, the law must be amended.
You have no such authority as President, and only the whole Senate can offer laws.
How do you want to do this?
When I lobbyed as a citizen to make the tours a free entrepreneurship, it succeeded.
The problem is politics, when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or on the right, he is deliberately being deliberately prevented, and this deters citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have much greater potential to receive support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I do not have party layouts on the shelves, I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it.
Do you think you're a person that's more right or left-handed?
From a Czech point of view, I feel that people refer to me more to the left.
It doesn't matter to me at all, a little left or a little right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
It's not about someone being right, but about someone on the left, I want to combine people.
I will always support any good decision for society whether it will offer HRM or GDP, and I will likewise be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do you not prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
It can be called populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already in operation in the world, or are spoken of by prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament, only slogans will remain.
You're not going to stay in politics with that.
Or do you think that when you go out with people and talk to them, you will be able to carry out criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have another opportunity.
Just persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I had been elected President, there would be no problem in organizing a direct television broadcast in which I will return to the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties, calling for legalization of the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell them why they do not want to.
If there is a strong person who will speak of abuse, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the President's direct elections, which was a merit of public pressure.
I'm telling you directly, I'm a lover, not a genius, and I'm not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies to stand up for my beliefs and views.
I am only a politician, and for my programme, I will try to obtain the support of the majority.
I'm trying to move on my own; if that is not possible, I'll be back to the private sector six years later.
It's kind of sounding like Ocamura's supposed to save Czechia.
I'm not a savior.
I know I'm not going to do anything alone, so I've gone around a number of famous people with the offer of balloting at the Senate.
I went to Radio Janchur, and he refused a lot of work.
I also supported at least the leading investigator, journalist Jan Lorentsov, who opened up fraud with light oil products.
I've put out my candidacy because people are really unsatisfactory, but now I feel weighed.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote, and the majority of those who had come to the testimonies.
We're only two independent at the Senate.
People chose the Senate to make changes difficult.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to check the cleanness of the past of every potential supporter, and I don't have any money for it.
There's no money on the presidential campaign, only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property declarations, and what about your own business with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have an area in Prague worth about 25 million, a ten million apartment, another 8 million apartment, a collection of artwork for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million, and a Superb School for a million, and a few million more.
By the way, Aston-Martin had me because it was my boy's dream -- I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, was a gallantine with women, and at the same time fought against the undergrowth and lawlessness.
You're traveling to Aston Martín, you owning 60 million property, and you don't have money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want your own money to invest in it.
That's not very persuasive.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the pre-election campaign from my pocket.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover senatorial wages.
But I wouldn't live for that money, for example, I couldn't pay my son for an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't have been running.
So, then, you're going to be doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut down this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, my activities have been partially reduced.
For example, my deputy will be headed by the director of the tourist agency in spring.
People would like me to be an unsubstantiated person who will keep the republic.
But I have something to live on, too.
How much as an entrepreneur are you used to get monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, I'm still getting it.
And if I had become president, my business would be over.
A full interview you'll find on Saturday issue of The Right.
MVRDV architects prove that these adventures are not only in the imagination - in the case of Spakenisse and its recently constructed Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building seems fun, it looks futuristic, and we're finally able to see something interesting," says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist near a large enterprise, thinks, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need another library today?
Everybody has Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
Now no one volunteers to go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spikenisse, a small, spectacular bedroom town under Rotterdam, owns an unusual record.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to build seven fiction bridges, which are depicted in the euro notes, in the form of painted miniatures from ironobeton.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city's fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
Vini Maas of the Murterdam Architecture Bureau of MVRDV, the master of bold column charts and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical structures, reacted to the task with its normal unwittingness and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and a smile on the face.
And while the members of the jury looked awkwardly and shook their shoulders, the disgusting Maas made a pyramid from his original gift of size, and finished speaking in defense of his project with the words, "Honorable citizens!"
This is my offer, "The Book Mountain" in Spakenisse, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, grew.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, supermarket, mail and several living houses and townhouses, totalling 50 apartments.
In early November, the “Best Library of the Netherlands 2012” was awarded the second award.
The project also participates in the 2012 national Dutch wooden competition.
Thus, the faceless suburbs, which had previously been unable to offer nothing but the postmodernist pedestrian zone and the amazingly unbestial cattle, the white facades of which are implying the idea of milk plant, have become richer for one modern artwork of the architecture.
But most importantly, in Spakenisse, the first public building in the history of this town was a cultural building.
A Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that the book Eldorado is under the cheese colt.
There is only one elevator in the center of the mountain range, for real worshipers of architecture and reading will prefer to study the area on foot.
On all sides, a leafy and easy - sighted space, burned brick floors and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban area.
Urban environment regenerated perfectly.
The glance is eager to look for benches, dogs, and soccer boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Sometimes the bookstores are standing along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, typically uncomfortable and faceless," says Vini Maas.
We set up a classic configuration of the space from the leg to the head and pulled the reading zone out of the inside.
The inner space of the book mountain has been used in a good manner: the centre has offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental centre and technical facilities.
The black book shelves, which serve as walls, or parapets, or staircase pearls, are especially welcome.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even tempted architects and builders are losing their speculations as to what it's like to be an unknown material.
"We were trying to work with secondary materials," explains Yop Traubborst, the project leader of the Spakenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once in one agrarian business in Frisland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in the heat and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial fibre thickness of a millimetre is used as a substitution for roots.
It's cheap and saves time.
The fine textile serves between 1 and 2 seasons and can then be thrown out.
For the library, this canvas -- for the first time in such volumes -- was compressed in a panel of four centimeters thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Lendbauplastic (KLP) turns into dark, homogeneous, solid material, a little resembling a new car and a little crossing.
The top is 105 degrees.
Those who travel about 500 m long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with a fantastic view on the city but also with Dutch croquets and wood pricks in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, especially the proper humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Expenses for a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is an exemplary environmental project," says Trouberst.
Its heating and cooling uses the warmth of the ground.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass flame, even in clear days the sun falls inside only for a little while.
Large farms from glued wood situated perpendicular to glass facade give shadow and take most of the sun’s beams.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The rest of the protection is fully automatic rolling curtains.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
And a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, Cynthia Godard, who called Bukenberg "Spakenisse's soul that's long missing."
The reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident was invited to donate a book from his own congregation.
These books were to take empty places on the shelves of the entire library, which at that time had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are placed upstairs.
"There's nothing worse than a semi-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has some connection with this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for ornament.
Thus, MVRDV was able to meet the royal task, which in a professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spikenisse wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
It's just a starting point to build identity.
Sabo: “The Germans must play a more important role”
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Sabo, the expert on U.S.-E. relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinians ' application for observer status with the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position does not support it either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical to Israel.
During the Libyan revolt in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the voting on the establishment of a banned flight zone.
As a result, NATO made this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The point is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, that is, moving from the policy that the United States, in effect, governed, to its own foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is compounded by the lack of a coherent single policy among the Europeans.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they start their role, they're on the way to "normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy of France or Britain.
What does "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a national position independent of the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, i.e. exports and linkages with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ' s economic interests were largely different from those of other major States and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position of the Middle East conflict and voted in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large marketing markets in the Middle East, in particular in the States of the Gulf of Persia.
It therefore needs to be cautious in order not to insult the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give too much weight to that, it's not a completely unilateral link.
But in any case, this plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I'm sure in Europe and even in the United States, the understanding of German position prevails.
That's why I don't think it was as dramatic as the Libyan question.
Germany may even gain some respect in this way.
That signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that it should be taken into account in its interest.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, the veto was clearly expressed.
Is there a divergence between the United States and many European States?
Because of the American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama Government has a deep understanding of the European position.
But in the local political situation, of course, the Government cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the substantial divergence of views is not as significant as it always appears.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will note that Obama is not very pleased with Netanyahu's policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important EU partner on the other?
I think that makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier if there were a single, uninterrupted European policy, but that was not the case now.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and have to act instead on their own vision.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think in the future, Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that it is not easy for Germany to do so, at least because of its relationship with Israel.
This subject has always been fragile.
But I think the Germans are clear that they have to play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take the lead?
Or is Germany still hard to play a leading role?
Germany has not yet become accustomed to this, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis, every time Germany takes an important role, a wide range of anti-German feelings are manifested.
The Germans don't just handle it.
Actually, it's an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must take into account a wide range of neighbours and views, which is not easy.
So the U.S. influence in European policy is steadily diminishing, but at this point the EU is not filling this vacuum, who remains?
The Germans just have to play a larger role.
Even if you don't like it, it hurts or exacerbates your disloyalty to you, it's life!

"Safety of Goodmarks" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a totally officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms whose names it has been formed.
However, it will be protected until the original title owners have filed a claim.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"To foreigners, it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes in the violation of trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk every week, there's a new business of this kind.
Simply add a couple of letters to obtain the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci comes Lu-Guci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises, such as the Puma sports producer, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a directory with records of the trademark registration department in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, which also used the name of the fashioned Ermenegildo Zegna house.
The fact that Chinese are world champions to copy and violate intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities, there are multi-story umbrellas that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, Pattloch's cases are not the same, and according to his trustees, he opposes the fact that Chinese enterprises are officially given the trademark registration agency the right to use a name that is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "minpai bang," "passier stamp."
This word is associated with the “bank of the dakuan”.
That's what they call women who hunt rich men.
China’s authorities do not accept the blame
"This is detrimental to the business, and it must be fought," I am convinced by Pattloch.
"The stamp is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image is very suffering."
The financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated by millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to a CLSA market research company, China, with a sale of 15 billion euros per year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury items.
However, it is difficult to remove doubtful records in the trademark registry, which is costly.
The process may last up to nine years, with unclear results.
Pattloch describes cases in which the court dismissed the claims because after a long time, the challenged title was “the realm of the market”.
If the plaintiff is unhappy, he'll even have to pay the plastic because he damaged his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the jungle law rules here.
There are also famous graphics cases.
In 2009, Daimler lost a judicial dispute with the construction manufacturer, Sany, a company that had recently acquired a concreteosos company Putzmeister.
Therefore, Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to a Mercedes star.
The Volvo company Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled BMW; the process was successful, and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion producer lost in China simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, with a famous crocodile looking differently.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO Mark Registration Statement in Beijing confirms that the shortage of staff and facilities there had been difficulties in 2010.
But last year, there was a "return from an emergency in the work process to a norm".
For example, the number of outstanding objections decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still awaiting production at the department.
Coping With It Is Precious
As often as China is, the figures are impressive.
Last year, more than 1.4 million trademark security applications were received in CTMOs, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has headed a list of new registrations worldwide 10 consecutive times, reports the department.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan were paid.
If simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 480 Yuan or 160 euros.
It's worth a lot more than being degraded, as Freudenberg's German family business has shown.
For more than seven years, the constituency has been fighting against the Chinese plagiar.
The Germans have succeeded in eliminating the illicit production of fake road parts.
However, the simulator secured Chinese trademark rights to Freudenberg.
This was a personal omission, since the names in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration agency rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won both of the following, but the enemy is still fighting.
There's a need to be alert.
The matter is now under consideration by the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs were hardly accountable, and the firm ' s archive had even to review the acts of centuries ago in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposite side a “big six-digit euro” for a settlement.
"It's all clear how expensive it is to us," says Wenthsler.
The Dangers of the Far East are threatened to be overthrown even into Europe.
It is in the case of imitators registering unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoe and leather products.
Concerne had long ceased production in these areas, but had been able to prevent registration.
"We need to be alert," says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattloch lawyer recommend that German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international provisions for the protection of trademarks, rather, for aliens to “all that is worth protecting, to register in China also in any way”, said Wentzler.
Otherwise, it might cost a lot more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of its trademark drama, it will have to pay the opposing side of the licence fees for its own name, explains Ventzler.
Otherwise, we'll be pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, choir Imbongi -- and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relationships that reached over 8,733 kilometres.
Initially, the flooding of cowboy boots, basketball crossings, ladies boats, and male tips are picking up a tact on the parking floor and quickly finding it.
One-two-three-four.
Only then will the voices of singers, alth, bas, tenor, and soprano, come, fascinate, and follow each other.
And Phile Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his mother's shoes when he leads them with flexible and distinctive gestures.
The evening of Monday, at the Horn Imbongi Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty participants from 23 to 69 years of age attended the rehearsal, from a human genetic specialist to a palace.
Om "Obani" is a difficult thing, every choir's voice has its own text, and in a completely foreign language: Zulus, which speaks eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for Self - Help
The United Nations AIDS programme estimates that around 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzheni, the Voices for Africa has found chiefs in Germany.
Of them, 70 are attending a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the boss.
It guarantees the child money for school, school form and daily hot lunch in Gogo Centre.
Imbongi in Zulus means a storyteller or a praiser.
There's no running to the banta in this room, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the chorus is teaching songs in this soft language in another person and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared — south Africa.
After all, the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the German choir voices, is located at a distance of 8733 kilometres from Heidelberg, northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland.
Infected 40 per cent
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw cabins, among many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the HF virus.
At Esitzeni, the miniature is reflected in Swaziland's disease: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF data.
The circumcision of the extreme flesh in men, which provenly reduces the risk of halved infection, is hardly accepted among the population.
More than 40 per cent of the Swaziland population bear immunodeficiency virus, and deaths by the middle of the fourth tenth are not rare.
Hor opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in spring 2005, but before Imboni saw many children on the streets, not only in need of parental care, but simply in the area of food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, there is no chance for a person in a poor country.
This was first a private commitment by individual participants, in a few euros per year, to send the child to school and to allow him to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voices for Africa, which has since almost professionally cared for AIDS orphans in Esitzeni.
Sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Syphilis, chlamidios and tripper (honorea) are attributed to bacterial CPIs.
HIV, human papillome-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis are often virused.
The lobby pedicules and spices are related to parasitic PPIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mostly from men who have sex with men.
The Robert Kocha Institute is of the view that, in at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Heterosexual adults often suffer from sexually transmitted diseases are chlamidious infections, trichomonias, candydosis (greek), gonorrhea and human papiloma-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are borne by this group.
Among young people, chlamidian infections are significantly higher than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections are affected by young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
We also have a human papiloma virus among young people.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory registration.
Syphilis morbidity, according to the Robert Koch Institute, has doubled more than 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It's about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate the venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may result in genital mutilation, urination complaints, releases, stomach pain, and bubbles or damaging.
Often, however, they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection but do not provide 100 per cent protection.
Partly, sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact and close physical contact.
Experts therefore recommend a regular survey, especially when sexual partners change frequently.
In early diagnosis, most of the PPIs can be cured and remote effects can be avoided.
The Chiefry, donations, and not the last fee for choir performances throughout Germany, allow for something to be gathered.
"We've all sent about 200,000 euros to Esitzheny," says Annet Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of Germany, Codu Dlamini, a deliberate and active woman, is administered by money.
She also ensures that orphans are well established, such as one of her grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call it in Zulus, is a village pillar.
Some of them have accepted up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children in uniform are regularly present in their classrooms every day.
Those who do not have their relatives go to Hanysil's shelter, a single woman who receives the wages of the association, as well as two cooks that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the “Voices for Africa” association organized a sewing school, built two chickens, and jointly with the United States PSI Health Organization organized HIV analysis for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease that is so evident throughout the country prefers to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annete Lennartz, "because it's connected with sexuality."
It is rather unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of surplus.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a State-authorized lifestyle is also guilty of spreading the HF virus so quickly in past years.
But it also lies with fermenting workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally at every corner, says Annethe Lennartz, "but they are almost unused.
Another culture is flesh to the flesh."
To support a little cultural exchange, choir Ibmogni travels every two or three years to South Africa and sings songs full of sadness, war spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many in the southern part of the black continent have known since apartheid.
The bus, full of white people who sing black songs, not only brings good mood and joy, but even tears tears in the eyes of severe border guards.
The trip is also used in Esitzeni, where singers visit the child.
Although a small village can hardly be found on the map, it is more than known in the Etzulveni Valley.
"Go to Esitzheny, there is light," say the people here.
And after an 8733-kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, when the dripping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light is also burning here.
NASA opens ice in Mercury.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that Mercury had ice on the planet.
The Ice Cover may have a thickness of up to 20 metres.
NASA Space Authority has proved that there is ice on the Mercury planet.
Although it is nearest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, as shown by three studies published on Thursday in a special journal of Science.
The Messenger Zond found evidence that the ice is constantly covered in the shadow of the world.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, perhaps up to 20 metres.
Possibly, the water occurs from a comet or perhaps an asteroid encountered by Mercury.
No one links the discovery of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can be 426 degrees Celsius.
These discoveries, however, could help explain how water and other construction elements of life had fallen to other places of the solar system.
Unremarkable to earth’s inhabitants, telescopes and small robots, such as Fenix, are studying the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth: small eyewalks in endless gifts.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the Karlic planet Cereir.
Like Pluton, who speaks about the sun for Neptune, Cerera, by the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a “planet”.
This fragment of the Spitzer telescope's infrared image represents the "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest blue stars, the harder to identify in the star circle, the pink "newborn" stars.
This zoom region -- scientists unromanticly call it W5 -- is open to the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopei constellation at 6500 light-years.
This overflowing fever of a dying star photographed NASA's Spitter telescope.

This new star in all beauty could only be photographed with infrared sensors from Spitzer Telescope.
Saturn and his ring: How did they come about is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It's probably a slice of Saturn's moon that disappeared inconsistently 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear images of the Habble telescope: the Aquarius Galaxy
Depending on the color of the photographs, spiral galaxies are transformed into actual works of art.
The photo published by the European South Observatory shows a few thousand-year light-year nebula of Triphyd in the star of the Shrivel.
The name Triphid is derived from the Latin word trifidus (three-drawn, three-dimensional), as the dark dust strips are divided into three parts of the piled heart of the stars.
In the constellation of the Zmeenos, astronomers photographed a space clash for 400 million light-years away from the Earth, the nucleus of two blending galaxies will meet each other and will inevitably be confronted.
This star birth Habble telescope took off in the spiral galaxy of M83.
Anyone who does not like the technical reductions may call it by the name "Second Cell".
The Habble Space Telescope photo shows a fragment of Iris's Nebula in the Cephei Consortium.
The Nebula removed for 1,400 light-years consists of particles of dust, sizes of which are 10 to 100 times smaller than those of the normal domestic dust.
This image was drawn from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes removed by 430 million light-years from the Earth.

It's a star cloud connected to the Rosette Nebula, and it's also constantly creating new stars -- 5,000 light-years away from the Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a little black hole, there's no dust, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it had emerged shortly before the Big Bang, when most of the universe had hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe — Critical Telescopes
Probably the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgey, even before Galileo Galileo began to monitor the stars a year later.
Since then, optical telescope mirrors have become more and more accessible to their view of space.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, represented here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S., the "Big Binocular Telescope" is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each diameter 8.4 meters.
The “Canarias Telescopic Green” has a giant inner device, the diameter of one mirror alone is 10.4 metres.
The “Big South African Telescope” mirror in South Africa is segregated to lower value.
However, in diameter it reaches about 11 metres.
Insufficiency of inexpensive constructive performance: The telescope is rigidly tightly attached to vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its characteristic: high light-driven ability.
It reaches -- despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror -- the parameters of the largest world telescopes.
By means of a radio telescope in Aresibo, Puerto Rico, researchers listen to extra-terrestrial signals in space.
The radiotelescope is 305 meters diameter.
Participating in the Outer Mind Exploitation Project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its computational power.
A view of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's a very big telescope here that's totally appropriate to its name.
Its four mirrors allow even the average infrared spectrum to be illuminated in the visual pipe.
The ESO Observatory of Chile also plans to install a European Big Telescope Sense.
Its main mirror is to be scattered 42 meters and made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, photographs should be expected no earlier than 2018.
By 2007 both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors of ten metres diameter.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also watches the sky with Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope with a diameter mirror must appear on Mauna Kea.
Here, they can look at the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space are supplied by the Habble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, he has provided pictures of far-reaching worlds.
Since March 2009, Kepler's space telescope has been looking for planets outside the Solar System, especially those on which life is possible.
NASA reported on 2 February 2011 that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The recent preparations of the Kepler space telescope have been sealed in the photographs.
James Webb's space telescope (JWST) will be shipped to space no earlier than 2018 on the Arian 5 missile.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope is 6.5 metres diameter.
One of the telescope's tasks is to look for the Big Bang in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists believe that Mercury is ice in the South Pole.
However, there is no reliable evidence of this, since Messenger is moving closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radar measures for decades have indicated that Mercury has had ice.
Thanks to the 2004 Messenger Zonda, the first one that is rotating around Mercury, the scientists are now sure.
Eat oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people have reached a biblical age.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people have reached a biblical age.
There's even a longevity museum here.
Finding a solution in a country where 97-year-olds appear to be relatively young.
The trip through the Talish Mountains is wild and romantic.
The Micrautobus creeps on the gulfy road past the dense forests of hills, stormy rivers, and simple peasant homes.
Everything is so green and bright that you might think you're in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southest side of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometres away.
There are tales, a people of the Caucasus who are known for a little, except that they speak beautifully to Farsi and Azerbaijani, and have a long history.
The end point is Lerik.
A small town is thrown down by an too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which is inconsistent with a beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe are hardly coming here, the road from Azerbaijani capital, Baku, is too tired.
Eight hours pass by 323 kilometres, as the road has only one strip.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea is here until it reaches the province.
However, Pilate Fatulayev (48) is convinced that there is more to interest visitors in Lerika.
"In May, Baku was celebrated by the Festival of Evrovidence, and next year we will have a festival of the world's oldest people," says Fatulayava.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
There is a documented biography of about eight dozen tales of these places over 100 years of age, and Fatulayava points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
He had another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the Shirala Muslum, which was allegedly 168 years old.
No birth certificate, however.
In view of the fact that the oldest person whose age is confirmed by documents was 122 years old, the age of Musluma is extremely questionable.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayawa.
The husband was married three times, and he had 23 children, and at 136 years of age, he had a daughter.
So did the Muslum chicken add a couple of decades to its age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at Max Plank Institute in Rostock, heard of the long stayers in Middle Asia.
“Only many elderly people can also be found in certain parts of China, in Japan or in Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “in Sardinia there are also extremely old people.”
However, because of the lack of documents, age is not possible because there were no civil registries.
Every day a glass of drowned oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of Lerik are often astonishingly reaching the Bible’s age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why are there so many long-lasting here in the south?
Azerbaijani guide, Farid Muhimzade, explains this by special genomes of the tales.
The director of the Fatulayeva Museum, on the contrary, believes that it's about food.
Talks love meat, bread, and most breastfeeding, many drink every day at a cup of decayed butter, but it is unlikely that high - colored diet can be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it the first way of life that youth persists?
At the age of 97, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims that she has 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She's sitting on the floor with a barrel of butter, which she's riding all over the place without tired.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of the sons and daughters of Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two young children are also jumping nearby.
In the kitchen, the guests are cooking teas that are given in typical bolted glasses of armuda.
Mirzaev has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, and under her head tip she hides the long dark-Russian coats that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
"And I've never used a champagne," says Mirsaev.
Monthly pension is sufficient for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own courtyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought any food in the store all my life.
She then tells of her husband, who was serving in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it's better when Gedar Aliev's "lovable father" got at the wheel.
Propaganda doesn't often sound in the old woman's speech.
However, the cult created around the image of the father of the nation, which ruled the country as dictator, in Azerbaijan is virtually unaware of the boundaries.
He was in power until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, took over.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani old people.
230 manats (approximately the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension, and for local conditions it is an amount that can be lived well.
And perhaps the oldest son of Mirzaeva is also right, "Starics in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded with care and happiness.
No Reason for Living as Long as Possible
The word “human rights” is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal a deep division in the country.
The future constitution, based on shariate, faced a violent resentment.
The Egyptian President did not stumble on the paphos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on State television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but primarily to Christian cops, liberals, educated Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly disunited in the frustrated opposition, are fearful.
Fear of the religious State in the Neil for the mercy of the powerful "Braty-Muslims".
Mohammed Murcy, almost apologizing, said that he had temporarily smashed the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended his competence to "saving the revolution."
But what really wants to save 61-year-old engineer, who has a degree of doctor at the University of South California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles have been delivered in the night 15-hour leap, with obstacles to an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a matter of concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings are based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do "principes" mean?
This was and remains the case of interpretation, and it might be feared that Islamists would use vague language and the resulting legal loft to interpret the sharia more strictly.
At least one new article suggests that all Sharia cases should be brought to the Council of the University of Al-Ashar, the most important Islamist institution of the country with great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy are supervising legislation that de facto would have resulted in the restriction of the judiciary.
Much in the draft Constitution is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: civilians must remain defended by a military court.
These courts during the Mubarak authorities served as a means of opposing the opposition.
After the dictator was overthrown into military detention, there were up to 11,000 civilians.
The draft also stated that the State must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “hold its morals and values”.
This is so unclear legally formulated that government agencies will be able to control even the content of movies and literature by means of this article.
The open text means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article defines gender equality directly.
But another forbids the prophet Muhammad and his messengers to insult and reproach.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
It is also doubtful that the wording that “human offense” is prohibited.
Is there enough cartoons for the president or a joke about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in the draft, which Murcy proposed for signature and which he said “only soon” would be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
Revolution's back.
For several weeks, opposition to the superiority of Islamists has been formed.
Tens of thousands of people gathered together in unusual unanimity on Friday night at Tahrir Square in Cairo and swore to destroy this document before it can enter into force.
"Revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former leader of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, stated that the draft constitution was “in the land of history”.
Through a short Twitter news service, he accused Murcia's adherents of wanting to lead the “travel against democracy”.
"If he declares a referendum, we'll go to his palace and throw him down," said Opposer Yasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, our brothers' blood is not yet vengeanced," quotes the Egyptian media's opposition policy, Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
“Coran is our constitution”
The well-organized “Brathya Musulmanes”, in turn, called for a contrasting demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, for caution, but on the other side of the Nile Prayer to Cairo University.
A large number of women under covers and salaphites were involved and shouted: “People require the application of God’s law”.
They asked Murcia to cleanse the country, and they said, "Coran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic area at which it all began led to a virtually civil war.
Mursie’s followers evidently refused to go on that risk.
The Muslim Bratia stated that both opposers and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
It is now time for the people to decide at the scrutiny of the country's direction.
Most of the Islamist project is considered a decision.
"The notion of "human rights" is never mentioned."
Hafis Abu Saed is fierce about this intensified constitutional process, which was to last until February with the participation of all the public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOD) defended “Bratev Musulman” when in Mubaraka they were in prison or tried.
Not because he divided their minds, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never appear in the new constitution, and he regrets talking to "Welt am Sonntag."
The increasing influence of Murcia on all three branches of government in the State is disappointing to the lawyer.
These measures constitute a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“In place of strengthening the civil State, the President de facto canceled it,” regrets Saed.
Democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, who is looking at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tensions.
For this, the payment may take place.
A demon on the Tahrir Square warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian shellfish: the stupidest scenting fish in the world?
The five million Norwegian population is one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Perhaps the secret of the country's success is somehow linked to local addictions to one extremely zolon fishing dish?
Take some reconnaissance cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweat sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're going to have a burstishing smell of shellfish, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very beautiful, but it smells incredible in the air.
Raffisk is a salt trout and dives in the water up to the year, depending on what the shower needs to achieve.
As the dusky and cold dung, the Norwegian crowds gather at a festival in Fagernes, which is dedicated to the same thing, say, an exciting dish.
“They eat cheese and drink aquavit aquavit, a local tmin vodka,” explains Havard Halvarsen, a local professional fireman and a joint “raffis general”, who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat a small - cut fish and drink it with a lot of alcohol.
"Someone likes aquavit more than a carcass," says Haward.
This drink can break the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you can carry a piece underneath your nose, it's not that bad, it's not much different from the terrain you've been carrying on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from very different times, times of poverty, when, before refrigerators arrived in the autumn, fish were smuggled in hermetically closed barrels with salt water.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had been well and thoroughly contaminated, they were recovered from it and, having numbed the perception of alcohol, were used in food.
Even in the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly, more than 13 per cent of immigrants who are employed here, high wages and developed social security.
Swedish residents (a long-standing rival and a much more prosperous neighbor) come to work here largely.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an unprecedented, even though a scorching element of the past of Norway.
It's one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, all of this is expensive, little beer glass or sandwich, and it will cost you £9 (US$14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most people in the country seem to do so.
People here still reluctantly mention the name of Anders Bravik, the racist and extremist of the right-wing, who fired and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the terrorist is referred to as “witnessed on 22 July”.
Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country, one of their citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway's current well-being is based on growth (from the beginning of the seventieths) as one of the largest oil-gas industries in the world.
"One thing about oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, which is spreading pots with retentioned cancer, a woman with long, bright hair and amazingly blue eyes, embodied Nordic well-being.
We are a people, as you call it, a prudent one.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks beautifully in English.
We don't like to show up, we're not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil, and most of the oil-gas revenues are invested in a special fund established for future generations.
In the years that preceded the world financial crisis, when all had been destroyed by money that they had not had, Norway was careful to calculate all the costs.
"As long as you can roll on winter skis and walk on summer trips, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there's a carbohydrate," she adds with a nomadic laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food, I'm done with a scrap.
Here's a hamburger with elbow meat, that's exactly exotic, delicious juice meat.
But tonight, we'll have more of the same scented fish.
At my hotel, a special dinner on the carcass, during which the voters determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
It's going to be a direct television, showing a tie leader, surrounded by carcass plates.
It's like a song competition called "Euroviction."
"So, Torr-Yurgen, what do you estimate for the best fish in the mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, this is our assessment."...
Everyone laughs and applauses.
Someone's falling off the chair, maybe taking aquavit.
Or perhaps just breathing the smell of this fish.
The President of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, is facing a difficult start in his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Penja Nieto, is preparing to take office, correspondent BBC Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his people.
The road traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable state.
The city was overloaded by transportation and at a better time, and the steel barriers were built from Monday, cutting several key roadways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
This was not done, however, to prevent people from getting to work from suburbs, but to prevent protesters from entering the Parliamentary Building.
On Sunday, New Head of Mexico, Enrique Penya Nieto, will have a presidential bandage and will be intimidated by the government of the country.
It's not easy to do.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance in the administration of Felippe Calderon, which is now in power, but the country has been in war with drugs, which has lost some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My Government expresses its readiness to fight violence to the people of Mexico”, Mr. Penja Nieto, President of the United States, reported earlier this week to Barak Obama in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve that goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Penja Nieto, President of the United States, had developed a political career as Governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital, the views of the new leader were divided.
Rectangular Man
In the idile town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is remembered with warmth.
The residents deserve the revitalization of tourism, the development of the курort and the creation of infrastructure.
One of the new highways built by Mr. Penja Nieto, which differs in a variety of ways with beatings and pits that were previously in this area, can be reached to the city.
The tablets with his name hang on a modern sports center building and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We link our hopes with him for real and serious changes,” says his friend and political allies Gabriel Olvera Hernández, State Congressman of Penny Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed by our country, particularly in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous residency, the PRI party was pushed out in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence in the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, the party holds great hopes for Enrique Penja Nieto.
In addition, he denounces the allegations of inconsistency that have been put forward by the new President of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to embodiing his vision of the country's future.
It's a great public figure, and above all, a person who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different view of the former governor.
The Municipality of Nesaualcoatl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most powerful contrast with the wet streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the estacades of the highways, it is in many ways the suburbs of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also severe in this megapolis.
Earlier this year, troops were engaged to reconcile drug gangs in those areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
In the desert, only in the past two years, several dozen bodies of killed women have been discovered near the extensive landfill.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorship of Mr. Penja Nieto, which is significantly higher than that in the sadly renowned violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become critical when it comes to the killing of innocent women.
According to Mr. Penya Nieto, he could best be said that he had not been able to deal with the problem of the killing of women during his tenure.
In the worst case, his administration was accused of totally ignoring the problem.
The resident of a concrete house that looks like most of the houses in this vicinity, Irenea Buendia is hardly able to contain tears, showing me photographs of her late daughter Mariana Moon.
According to the official version of Mariana, she committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her cohabitant killed her.
"When I got to her house, it was like her body was washed before," recalls Mrs. Buendia.
There were signs of her being beaten, and her body was shaken.
Mariana's mother tells this story, and the portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, which is marked with only one word: justice.
That is what they said was rejected by that family.
"The state's treacherous faces treated me as an old gossip, an unpleasant disturber of tranquillity.
They want people to simply accept everything they say and keep silent.
But that's wrong, so it's not possible, especially when there's so many violations and shortcomings around," she says.
When President Penja Nieto is in the presidential line on Saturday, he and her will take on a difficult responsibility.
During the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have dealt with violence-related crimes, and the new President has promised to prioritize the problem during his Government.
"I hope he'll be the same president as the governor," says Olvera, a congressman from Valé de Bravo from the PRI party.
This, however, is what the victims' families most fear in Ciudad Nes.
Bradley Manning didn't complain about ill-treatment, accusations.
The prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning ' s allegations of poor conditions of detention.
The hearing focused on Manning ' s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence requires the closure of the case on the grounds that Manning's conditions were cruel.
The U.S. ряд army is accused of abducting several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that ряд-line Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leakage of classified materials in the history of the United States, did not avail himself of many opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment that he said he had to endure while in a military prison.
During the cross-examination of the pre-trial hearing in Fort Mide, Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Ashden Fein, stated that the weekly visits to Manning by the prison authorities during the nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not contain complaints of ill-treatment.
A cross-examination as part of the review of the application for the discontinuation of Manning ' s case, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in itself sufficiently penalized, was carried out the following day after Manning had stated that he had been detained and intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analysis specialist arrested in June 2010 was accused of abducting several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks' resource did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the Attorney Fane, together with Manning, reviewed reports that were completed after the visits of Manning by the Administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention regimes from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When the Attorney Fane asked for the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he regarded the treatment of himself by the prison administration as “predominant” and the general conditions of the prison as “very professionally organized”.
The reports under consideration do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Feyn asserts.
Manning replied that he expressed oral concern about these problems and that the authorities visiting him had discussed those issues with him and had stated that they would be handled but had not recorded them in writing.
"They wrote down "they don't have any tests" (after I've been discussing my complaints), but that doesn't mean that I didn't raise this subject in a conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denis Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained of his ill-treatment in January 2011 at a meeting of the commission that considered the suicide intentions he had expressed in writing months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to see it removed from the “traumatism prevention” regime and mitigated the conditions of detention.
The military authorities explained that a limited prison regime, at a lower level than a suicide control regime, had been introduced to protect the prisoner and to protect others.
"I wanted to let the Administration know that I was all right for them to cancel the trauma prevention regime... so that my standard of life would improve, from my point of view," explained Manning.
On Thursday Manning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held almost two months before he was transferred to a prison at the Navy base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thought of suicide in Kuwait and that he had lost consciousness once because of heavy heat.
He explained that psychologically it is very difficult for you to know how your destiny is resolved and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world went to the base of Camp Arizjan, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I'd die in this cell."
He said that while he was in Quantico, Manning spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day -- in full loneliness.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, slappers, several clothes and glasses.
He says he's trying to move because he's sleeping, or he's just lying down in the daytime, he's forbidden the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he was constantly hit by a light coming outside of the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around in bed at night, he said he was buzzed and forced to move on his back.
Lawyer Manning formally objected to the ill-treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that, after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning inspection.
Manning stated that he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the check.
Responding to the questions of the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from the order of the guard that he should throw a blanket to which he could cover, but admitted that no one had directly commanded him to throw it.
On Thursday Manning stated that he had been forced to sleep naked last night because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could use a coward's rubber or slap to traumatize himself, but he didn't.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, slaps and glasses were taken out of the cell.
His lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account what he had experienced during the detention and significantly reduce the length of his detention if Manning was found guilty by a military court to start his case at the beginning of the following year.
The defence stated that it was up to Manning to accept guilt for less serious crimes and that other charges were contested as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is scheduled for those weekends, and it is expected that the prosecution party will insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of persons arrested with the strictest possible regime.
The charges put forward by Manning include an affiliation to the opponents, an illegal promotion of the dissemination of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to national defence and the abduction of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of the American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity to realize themselves.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left because they remind the people of difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans of American origin are breaking between two cultures.
During my recent trip to Mexico City, I went through the incoming corridor, approached the border control zone, and strangled on the ground.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicons), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood before them for a few seconds without knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was known as Mexican all my life.
It's just a conditional name like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York think they're Italian.
Later, I came to think of the complex design of "Mexicoan American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's home, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the language bearers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and became in line for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when newly elected President Enrique Penya Nieto of Mexico visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was the usual agenda for meetings of the Presidents of those countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Penja Nieto gladly spoke of the rise of the Mexican economy, which would enable Mexicans to remain in Mexico with the same success instead of moving to the United States.
He would like to conclude a partnership treaty with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Penja Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and hard-looking issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and had forced its leaders to renounce half of their territory.
But the Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and they see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for a U.S. state-owned person to talk at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, the press and the elites of Mexican society to complain that Americans infringe on the sovereignty of neighbours.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with militia.
Mexico's relations with over 35 million Mexicans living in the United States are most complex.
Would you like to talk about insults?
They're enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who are able to do so, and those who do not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent are only for one reason: at some point in their family history, someone, father or grandfather, was unable to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a particular type, stripped, uneducated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico it's different.
Today, our life is the embodiment of American dreams, we went to good schools, and we set ourselves up for good jobs, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider our own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them in the same way.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as people of Class II, as unreal Mexicans.
We don't speak Spanish well enough, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failure.
If our ancestors were successful in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We wouldn't be behind the silk curtain now, finding a well-fed life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalahar and was legally relocated to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are some tensions between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin -- Mexicans are more aware of their national identity, and the Mexican Americans are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We're listening to Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springstin.
Getting the best of the two worlds, you inevitably lose the roots.
We're Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called Mexicans.
Now, as I found during my visit, as if our already relationships were not sufficiently confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals wanted to restore their relationship with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work as Ambassadors of Mexico and represent her interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how well it is to visit it, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen their relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
It won't work.
Too much offense in the past.
In view of the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think that this country is so beautiful.
Excuse me, but take care of this yourself, Amigos.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unable to forgive the United States the way they dealt with Mexico half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still in offense for how recently Mexico dealt with their relatives.
Yeah.
Maybe we're more general than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas grouping can become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace possible between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
It was said that there had been a usual, pointless debate about who first started; that many buildings had been turned into ruins; that more than 140 Palestinians had been killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, missiles released from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of Israel's capital, Tel Aviv, and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the hopeless ties between the Israelis and the Palestinians in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East has undergone changes.
This can be seen in different ways, but the “Arab Spring” events have sparked many of the insurmountable realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis have not been able to stay away from the windstorm that hit the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will become even more bloody than before.
There are, however, reasons to hope to get out of this deadly impasse.
A War Without Victorious
At first glance, the situation did not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire signed on 21 November would be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement of Hamas, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will declare that they have forced Israel to retreat despite their losses.
Although some group leaders were destroyed and 1.7 million people were blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled parts of the world, Israel was unable to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas has increased its popularity in the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fath movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of the Islamist movements in the Arab world increases, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
The resurgenced regional leader, Turkey, once the nearest Israeli ally among the Muslim countries, supported Hamas and followed Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic developing States of the Persian Gulf.
Hamas's rival supporters state that an Islamic semi-month was created around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, in which the Hizbollah paramilitary group was ruled, to Syria, where the increasingly proselytized rebels ousted Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king was threatened by Hamas's allies.
The most significant change in the region has taken place on the southern borders of Israel, in the most densely populated and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the influence of the Mohammed Murcia movement has strengthened with President Mohammed.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay particular attention to Hamas's support.
On the contrary, Muslim brothers are an organization much like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic positions, Hamas can become an important player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, the supporters of the “sharp” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In a military sense, Hamas was overthrown.
The Israeli Anti-Ball Missile System of the Iron Dome has justified the costs of its creation and has successfully destroyed many of Hamas missiles launched.
Israeli citizens can sleep quietly, at least for a time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unwavering position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence against Hamas.
Another important factor is Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of Binjamin Netanyahu, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Although some 30 Israelis have been killed since 2004 by missiles released from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly by the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such acts in international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose party Likud, in preparation for the elections scheduled for 22 January, joined with even more aggressive conservators under the leadership of Avigdore Libermann.
What is the point of condoning and giving the Palestinians their own State?
If they give all their power to the West Bank, will they not start launching rockets from there towards Israel, as their gatherings in the Gaza Strip do?
Better keep them behind the wall and rigidly suppress any attempt to lift your head.
Probably the supporters of the hard line will win; however, their calculations may be dismissed in the Arabic spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries are not the warmest to Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defence budget of Israel is greater than that of all its Arab neighbours, together.
The initiation of war with a regional super-Power is unlikely to help Arab Governments to strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of the President of Egypt, Murcia, who worked with Barak Obama to cease the fire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to no lesser extent, take into account the long-term implications of its policies.
As democratic changes in the Arab countries erupted, the Palestinian deprivation of the right to self-determination constitutes a deceased bomb that will explode sooner or later in Israel's occupied territories, like a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already undermined the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic dimension of the growth of the Arab population only exacerbates those problems.
For the bloody operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas movement, the international community has to pay an increasing grievance.
Both sides need external momentum
There is the only solution to which sound representatives on both sides are tirelessly urged, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the establishment of two States and Israel's concessions to the territories in exchange for security.
There is hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to have a more effective impact on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which had long begun to decide to suspend arms transfers to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, had, as never before, a favourable position to persuade Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatch movements.
That would do more for the establishment of a Palestinian State than for the forthcoming ballot at the United Nations, which could result in the recognition of Palestinian virtual statehood.
President Obama must also play his role in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During its first term, it has not submitted its own peace settlement plan.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the reluctance to engage in a solution to the problem.
This is a catastrophicly short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Unified Packaging Act has entered into force.
The warnings on the harm to smoking and image of disease-affected parts of the body are contrasted with the depressed green boxes that are the same for all cigarette marks.
The first Australian law on single packing of cigarettes and tobacco has entered into force, replacing logo and coloring of different marks with the same box of defiling and olive color, with the relentless images of sick parts of the body and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking by their parents.
In addition to the different pictures and labels that warn of smoking harm, the only difference between the packages, which has been introduced in mandatory order from this Saturday, is the names of the marks, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for packing tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure is to prevent young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful fashionable status habit.
This was based on research that showed that people who did not start smoking up to 26 years of age, 99 out of 100 had never become smokers.
“Evidently, even at the very youngest age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to deliver through packing”, explains the Minister of Health of Tanya Plibersse, referring to studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of the princesss.
Australia was one of the least smokers in the world, so that those changes would not affect the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries were already considering the possibility of taking such measures.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the enactment of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market where cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will have serious consequences other than those thought by its initiators,” says Scott Macintyre, a representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Forged producers from China and Indonesia will provide much more such products for sale in Australian streets.
For someone, on the other hand, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha, of a small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd, claims that the demand for portsigars and silicone fountains that conceal unpleasant pictures in the package has rapidly increased (practically from scratch) since two months ago, such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan have tried to appeal the case in the high court of Australia.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already implemented some 6,000 products to wholesale businesses and is awaiting a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the view of experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
Following the adoption in Australia of a number of laws that have made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sports activities, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government had banned local companies and websites from posting advertising on the network, but it could not restrict foreign websites.
"If you trade tobacco and you only have this little loose, the idea of moving your goods on the Internet will seem extremely attractive to you," explains Becky Freeman, following public health issues at the University of Sydney.
Friman notes the increase in the number of claims for trademarks written from the face of allegedly ordinary users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is, is it really the case of a certain citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he didn't regret the effort and time and made the video, or is it behind the advertising company?
The Australian Office of the British American Tobacco asserts that industry is now more involved in adapting to new rules than advertising.
The representatives of the tobacco industry even referred to measures such as the sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these States have filed claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade had been unjustly restricted, despite the fact that trade relations between all those countries and Australia were very small.
WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tany Plibersec, the Government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first mandatory placement of photographs to warn of the harm to smoking.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is addressed in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstrating disobeying innovations.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I'm just not paying attention.
"Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket," explains Victor El Hayg, buying cigarettes with a picture of the mouth tumor on a pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can get me to leave is my little daughter.
James Yu, leader of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has made it more difficult to place the goods by the shelf.
"Now I've got an hour to unload the new party, and now four hours," he complains.
"Government has to be taken and completely forbidding cigarettes, we'd say, well, all right, we're done, we're closing the store," he says, putting his hands up.
It's not that bad to gambling in the world of electronic networks and constant connections.
On this Thanksgiving Day, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day waiting for a flight is really boring, and there's no much help for books, magazines, iPhone, or even duty-free trade stores.
Recently, however, more scientists and specialists in child development have been speaking in favour of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and our children, it is not that bad.
This forces the brain to divert itself from interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in today's world we are all constantly in front of any screen, the advantages of boredom pass by us.
Maybe we should try to get bored?
Yeah.
At the same time, no.
We'll be back to that.
I used to think, like many others, that boredom was a relatively recent discovery when people had more free time.
That is not the case, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history of the University of Calgary of Canada, author of the book Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
"In fact, boredom can be a very ancient story," he says.
At the walls in Pompeii, Latin inscriptions of the first century boiling beetle were found.
The question of how we understand the boredom remains open.
The problem is, says John D. Estud, Professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the boredom has often changed.
After studying research on this subject and questioning a target group of 100, Professor Estud and his colleagues came to the following definition: Boothing is when people “will but cannot do what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that the boring man doesn't do anything he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything in the apathy.
The main thing in the boredom, he says, is "disturbation of attention and the resulting mood deterioration and the feeling that time is going on slowly."
It may seem very depressive, as it relates to the boredom.
However, Professor Yistood argues that, despite the possible linkages between these conditions, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and the circumstances, and the depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored when it's really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study “Indeed of reason: the definition of boredom in terms of attention”, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Escud and his colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, who heard the recording of the magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to a television program included in a neighboring room, others heard the same low volume, so that they could barely be selected, and the third group only listened to the recording of the voice without a foreign sound track.
Those people who heard a low-sound television show that they were boring, often hard to concentrate, but they didn't know the reason and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, the interruption of attention may be boring, says Mark J. Fenske, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "e.g., looking into the flow of articles on the conveyer in the search for marriage, the distracting music can help to avoid boredom."
It's thought to continue that when people start rolling on a chair or drawing a caraquili on a piece of paper, they're doing it from boiling, but now we know that these are actually just helping to keep up physically.
“The study showed that children who are not banned to erse and rotate learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly”, says Professor Fenceke.
At some point, all of us are trembling at the delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, looking at an uninterested film.
Different people, however, show a different degree of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a special “dream-shaker” to measure such individual characteristics.
The evaluation on this scale uses questions and allegations, for example, “Much of what I have to do, uniformly and monotonally,” or “I am too much interested, so I don't have enough time.”
With such questionnaires, researchers have found that boys miss more girls, says Stephen Vodović, a professor of psychology at the University of Western Florida, especially if there are various external irritators.
In general, however, adolescents often miss them.
In 1991, Rid Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, undertook an experiment in which he contacted a pegger with almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7 to 8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of teenagers stated that they were bored at school and at home, and 23 per cent said they were bored outside school.
At the same time, only 3 percent of parents noted that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he does not have any data on what such boiling data would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescents have a high degree of boredom”, mainly because children and adolescents are not able to fully decide what to do.
Let's go back to my original question, is it boring?
Sometimes it is not because, in extreme manifestations, it can, according to studies, encourage people to act absurdly and dangerously, risky gambling, or to abuse certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the relationship between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodović, who devoted more than two decades to studying the problem.
"So our brain tells us to do something else; that's a boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But this brain itself doesn't always know exactly what to do.
If you're bored and you're going to put that energy on a guitar game or a cooking experience, you're going to do better for yourself.
But if you watch TV, you'll only be better for a while, and it'll soon pass away.
So if your child misses and you give him iPad, he won't miss, but he won't learn to fight boredom by himself or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Fenceke.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he asserts.
Your child learns not only to be self-employed; he also learns to control himself at all.
I don't think the boredom needs to be exalted.
But it shouldn't be considered a bad thing either.
Rather, it should be learned to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Estud agrees.
"We see it so that we need to be trembling more often, and that boredom is a very unpleasant, unsatisfactory desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people are trying to break free from constant anxiety and just relax.
"In the modern world, we're used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when there's silence, we're lost and we don't know what to do."
To date, it is not clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old soccer team player and a college student in the south-eastern state of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that will soon be fully legal throughout the state: holding a small portion of marijuana and tube in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamara and drove in a car on the prairie near the Kansas border when the police stopped them.
After a police officer discovered in a marijuana car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for the possession of drugs and the possession of drugs - minor offences for each of which was a 100-$ fine - and the date of the trial.
"We're treated as criminals," says Mr. Orosco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which lasted several weeks after Colorado voted for legalizing the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of review.
The charges of minor marijuana-related offences have already been removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, D.C., which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already ceased to charge people at the age of 21 and above for holding small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as a few weeks later the law enters into force.
However, in more conservative districts in Colorado, the prosecutors have decided to deal with existing marijuana-related cases and continue to hold the drug accountable.
At the same time, in some cities, from Denver suburbs to the west mountain areas, they vote to prevent the arrival of new, licensed shops in the State for the sale of marijuana.
"It all develops so fast that I don't even know what to wait for," says Daniel J. Outs, the chief of police in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
The supervisory authorities in Washington are also puzzled to respect their heads.
They will have to establish rules for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, all of which must be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in resolving the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado, the more ordered market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian E. Smith, representative of the Board for the Control of Production and Marking of Alcohol Products in Washington.
But no one can do more now, recognizes Mr. Smith, than put forward any proposals and hope that this will work.
"We don't have a real precedent for which we could focus," he says.
The State Act of Washington, D.C., referred to as I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and will bring the state into uncertainty for a year when the State licensing system is not yet available and the right to own the marijuana is already legally established.
There are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's “appropriate access” order to a licensed marijuana with a ban on trade of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be especially difficult to place licensed marijuana trade enterprises in the city line, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the recently established research team “Centre for the Legalization of Marijuana”.
On 21 November, Police Chief Outs of Aurora sent an e-mail report to his subordinate that the Procurator ' s Office of the City would no longer involve persons aged 21 to be held accountable for the possession of a small number of marijuana, and that the police had ceased to disclose these violations “from now on”.
Police chief Outs reported that the police would monitor the implementation in the city of regulations governing the activities of health-producing marijuana and would pursue illegal drug dealers and distributors.
The Prosecutor of Wald County in northern Colorado, Ken Bak, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After a vote on the bill, he stated that the Prosecutor ' s Office would continue to hold the marijuana accountable, primarily in order to encourage its users to receive treatment.
At present, 119 persons have been charged with the possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them have been accused of other violations.
“The obligation of our institution to pursue actions considered criminal at the time of their commission,” said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the Mesa rural district, where voters rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police of Grand Janksn, the largest town in the district, no longer hold adults responsible for the possession of small amounts of drugs.
The District Attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to remove the charges in the already open cases related to the possession of marijuana.
"I believe that to enforce the law until it changes, our direct responsibility," he says.
Although 55 per cent of the people in Colorado voted in favour of this decision, the inclusion of marijuana for public and legal entertainment would not be easy.
Controversial reactions in various states have revealed the ambiguity of the local authorities in the state of marijuana.
“The district prosecutors have a cultural barrier in this regard”, explains Sean Macalister, a Denver lawyer representing the defendants for the possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
"They have been persecuting people for this long, that they can't really accept that it's no longer a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington are the first states in which a small number of marijuanas are treated like alcohol - it is expected to be a pilot field on the national scale to verify the idea of the legalization of drugs itself.
Legislators and state officials are planning to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they look forward to receiving guidance from the federal authorities, who continue to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will retreat in this regard.
Despite the extensive arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical testimonies, the federal Government has in most cases benefited from the medical trade of marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The counter-narcotics agencies are unlikely to enter homes to confiscate a small marijuana packet, but they are unlikely to close their eyes to the reciprocal marijuana stores controlled by the authorities, which are permitted under the new law, Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug advisor in Obama's administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the presidential elections, some local authorities have approved a moratorium on opening new marijuana sales shops that could not open earlier than in a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the western state, introduced a six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in such a position that we're going to grant a license to someone, and then that will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the outcome of the local ballot and the one for which the State voted.
There are still many outstanding issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I've survived from Oxford because I'm a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I remember myself, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied in Oxford and described him as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogy of an ancient symposium that lays the two foundations of civilization -- freedom of thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks later, at the history Faculty of the Oxford College of Wooster at the end of the eighty, I collected suitcases and left, which was the first real scandal in my life.
My father didn't stand and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I quit college because I didn't like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink chicken cups.
It wasn't really so funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was systematically traumatized and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or what I was studying in private school.
I was only traumatized for one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment, it looked like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Whitet, was a famous adviser, Margaret Tetcher, and I myself was a conservatory supporter.
You'll ask, why do you think about it now?
According to recent data, the new generation of students who are law - centered are subject to the same trauma.
This institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as those given to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators at Corpus Christie College student club in Cambridge claim that they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They wish to introduce an additional representative to the College's Committee on Equal Rights to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation had only exacerbated the recent BBC 2 documentary on student policy “Strange of wonders: Young, Smart and Right”, where conservators were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazi.
The film showed Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford Conservatory Association, who travels to Rolls Royce, wears a silver suit and cane with a silver nabald.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they are doing "the liberation barrel because of higher fees for education".
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice President of the Association of Conservatives of the University of Nottingham, in an interview of a Sunday newspaper, said that “the university environment has been making a shift towards left views.
People who don't even know us beforehand consider us to be vicious and impunity children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the historical Faculty of Corpus Christy College, in which a request for protection was made, calls such an atmosphere “uncomfortable” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, a new president of the Oxford Conservatory Association, said that the attitude of the student club towards lawcentric opinions had deteriorated considerably.
"This constitutes a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply the normal life of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I wasn't just in a minority, I was on my own.
I arrived there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen - year - old girl.
Oxford fevered against hatred of a conservative party.
The university voted a year earlier by depriving former student Margaret Tetcher of her primacy due to the reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In this atmosphere, even steelists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the first week, when the students got to know each other and the teachers, I first felt I was waiting for me.
I didn't know that teachers were not only looking through the scourge of conservative students but they were happy to take part in it.
Political issues - the strike of miners, the privatization and dissent of the Government to apply sanctions against the Government of apartheid in South Africa - penetrated through the wooden walls of the auditors.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared to follow it.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now dead Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph."
The text was hard for me, and I stopped.
Harry Pitt was a very yellow person with a face like a cake.
"Tetcherists don't teach French in principle or they just lack brains?" he asked.
Other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
"To you take a few initial lessons of French at free time, if you're certainly not very busy, turning to society," said Pitt.
I went back to my room completely unhappy.
That night at college, I was sitting alone at lunch, and then someone slammed me on my shoulder.
It was James, a student of the second class from the English Faculty, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservatives Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendlylylyly.
Regrettably, this is the following:
Anyone suspected of sympathy with conservatives will be bullied.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know your father's close to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be more tough.
Most conservative pioneers pretend to be liborists."
Later, in the local pub, I was traumatic about hypocrisy.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Tutcher says.
Hitricity didn't succeed.
He said, "You're a daughter of a Faculty of Faculty of Philosophy, Politics, and Economy, who himself studied in Iton, "You're a Fascist Pig.
You're contagious."
Other students picked up his words.
I was ruined, dirty.
"How do conservators engage in sex?" one of them asked.
- They're beating each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixtieth years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet my fellow thinkers only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a lieborist and hide my true beliefs?
For the next three years, I began to feel like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college who did not hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for being Tetcher's foreign policy adviser and one of her counterparts.
He almost didn't show up at college.
He despised his provinciality, slightness and commitment to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he assumed a profession at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I started going to Oxford from my parents' home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his fortieth year, any political views were adopted.
"But this is the best university in the world," he complained.
- There's no way to do that, but not in a city of drowsy spiles...
Even my communist friends always acted perfectly."
His wet eyes are shattered.
"Don't make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You're gonna break my heart if you leave university."
I was exhausted by the constant trips to London and my emotional protection was weakened.
My friend, also the conservator, did not withstand pressure and abandoned his beliefs.
Next week, during the seminar, when the next history teacher really seriously called me "the enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In a shower of shame, I confessed that "I washed my parents' brains" and I called them "old fools."
Rebellion was short.
The last nail in my career tomb in Oxford was to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote two columns each week for Rupert Murdoku’s publications.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my persecutors surrendered.
When they left, I picked up the suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me plax and bastard.
But by the age of eighteen, no one should be subjected to such malice and intimidation in the educational institution.
Worse still, it was Oxford, who not only released fourteen Prime Ministers of Thori, but is still hidden for the undeserved reputation of the university, which values equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to glory."
ABC is talking to Naty Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica, and other famous Italian designer clients
Commercet House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to accept the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of the Valentino: Shield Master, a triumphal retrospective exhibit, which combines more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “house” over the past 50 years.
"I take this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "il signore" Garavani, but it could not be written without his nameless clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, there are personal letters and photographs of the most prominent aristocrats, from Princess Salim Aga-Han to Lord Snoudon, including Mari-Shanthal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophys of its social recovery from a modest portal from the city of Voger in northern Italy to a kumir of international “elites”.
Being in love with the royal court is not wrong.
"They don't at least extinguish the cigarettes of your great carpet, as some beautiful pop-music stars do," says Baronessa Fiona Tissen-Bornema.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino’s disliked master accepts visitors with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his loaf in Gstaad," explains the former wife of Hani Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beautifuls like Marella Anieli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino always preferred elegant glory.
And yet he's a star.
Valerie Maza, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valerie Maza recalls a charisma modeler.
One day we went to dinner with him at his home, which was after showing the fashions in Spain's area in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was manifest in every detail of his apartment, in her cleaning, in food, in music.
"Every of the guests Valentino has felt important and loved," recalls the "top model" that started with the modeler in 1995 during the High-Level Week in Paris.
"He never comes out of the fashion because his sketches are the actual works of art," she ends.
Parad of generosity
Haravani's life is a story, not of obsessions, but of love with full reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somersset House galleries was turned into a glamorous podium of 60 metres long, which suggests a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and has to deflect on the podium, a viewer of the "spiriters" from the greз that burst out the shelves of Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristote Yassis, the suit that Monica Vitty used in "Nochi" or the wool and skin coat that belonged to the emperica Fara Diba.
In this publication, the names of Sibil Luxembourg, Gloria von Tourn Und Taxis, Matthew Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg are well-known.
Nati Abascal and modeller, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino is like the first love, "can't forget."
I remember him perfectly.
These were trousers, shirt, jellyfish, and a juket from the autumn-zima collection of 1971-1972.
"It was the gift he made to me," says Naty Abascal, one of the music of the designer.
"I prefer him to the rest for his wifehood, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I like the colors that he uses: they have a lot of light and they're "approaching" to his face.
Proportions are ideal.
Princess and the Patricia della Jovampaol d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilet...
Lastly, that time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on the feast in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with fibers, a corsafe in a warehouse, and a cut without a bretel.
"It was a dream that had become a dream," says widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to the fashion, his passion is untimely," explains this Italian aristocratic woman living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps his ceremonial dress from a modeler with "maximal caution... because dress is not just a dress, it's also a combination of memories accompanying him."
The “Kingle” of the fashion
A large final of the exhibition at Somersset House - Mari-Shantal Miller wedding dress for her wedding with Pauls from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “women” (as called the sewing modeler) to make this silk of ivory color with pearl incursion, twelve different species and a sleeve of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Susie Menques, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of the tallest fashion of the late 20th century, the “return of customers from higher light”.
A long-standing “lead of life” of the elite, Valentino is now its best representative.
The Cavaler of the Great Cross (sign of the highest rank in Italy), the Cavaler of Labour, the Comandor of Arts and Words, awarded by the Order of the Honourable Legion, Garavani collected the same honors as any of his clients.
"Every time, my attention attracted his delicateness, his tranquillity, his acquaintance and his fine appearance," recalls D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a solemn dinner at Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was perfect, there is no time for him."
If that says the princess...
The world's hardest profession: Kawakh Iden miners
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by dragging 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano by steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn sulphur earnings in the Kawakh Iden volcano, located in the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Each day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas rises from the depths of the earth leaps in contact with the air.
The gigantic pieces of sulphur, the weight of which can be 70 kg, are cut into two bamboo baskets, and the basket on its shoulders, and carry them up on a rocky road.
Before the volcano’s height is 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the exhausted loaders need more than 40 minutes to rise up in a turtle’s step, hard to keep equilibrium and be cautiously pushing the road to avoid falling back and falling.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as was the case with one tourist from France who had blew a few years ago from the rocks of Cavah Iden.
Kawakh Iden has earned 5 eurocents for each kilogram of sulphur that is extracted
Upon being upstairs, they pave the way between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and tired of heavy basket, they walk three kilometres to the weights that the mining company had placed slightly higher at a height of 1,850 metres.
It is PT Kandi Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has operated this volcano since 1960 and, rather than say, its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) of petrochemical production, as it is common in daily life and is used for the manufacture of spears, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for the evaporation of sugar.
"Since the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (euro 3.8 euros) for each walk," Anto explains to us, which usually performs three daily movements.
It spends three hours on each of them, and at the end it feels broken, but it has accumulated 138,000 rupees (Euro1.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a Miser for such a non-human effort, it is three times more than that he would have earned in the field.
“The day-to-day wage for miners is very high in local terms, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) pay for coffee and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)”, explains the cargo who used to work as a rocketer on the Bali tourist island.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the section was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banjuvanga, a town near the volcano, for the reason that Indonesia was as depressive as sulphur: “I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus were, and brought her to Yava to accept Islam.”
Anto's got asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs all the time, and he's got eyes on him because of toxic gases.
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years at risk in Kawakh Iden, whose sulphur had already begun to affect it despite the presence of masks and special points.
He's got asthma, he's breathing hard, he's constantly coughing, and he's got eyes on him because of the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It's the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'll work for two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and smart young man could be a tourist guide, waiter, or porter in a hotel, but instead he does the mule.
For a dirty wooden cabin with other nosilvers, it rises every day at two o'clock in the night, because the sulphur continues to flow out at night, when its typical yellow color becomes blue and glitters in darkness.
Throwing a challenge to the shadows, Anto goes down to the crater, highlighting the road with a little light connected to his helmet, which he himself bought for his money.
About 400 wearers carve basket sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite its high profits, the mining company did not mechanize sulphur production to save costs or provide no equipment to the carriers who work on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for photography, which, along with an incoming ticket of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve are taken from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its men.
“This is work for livestock, not for people,” states Bandruzin, a rooted wearer for 42 years, who had spent three decades in Kawakh Iden since he left college.
He's able to raise up to 110 kilograms, and he's assured that he's going to endure the job "as much as he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns its throat and burns its eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so vigorous that no one complains about their severe diseases... more serious, obviously, than their habitual breathing problems, artroses, pains in the knees and beatings on their shoulders that were deformed under the weight of basket.
By balancing the basket on the back, Unikik can only raise 50 kilograms in 53 years.
Each day he and his companions carry 15 tons of sulphur from a volcano, which three trucks carry to a warehouse in Tamansari, traveling 18 kilometres of narrow tropical sulphur.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, wide opening his mouth that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, 30 years old, he also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest things in the world: what is being done by human mules from Cavah Iden.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporees blame careers, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"Sinternity needs to grow."
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, you're gonna fulfill our civil duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of leaflets, but notwithstanding -- or possibly because of that -- this video became a whiting on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
These phrases are part of the rap that uses local sentences like, "Let's put the bao (bull) in the liver" to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that by advertising they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun manner.
His creativity director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to help people fulfil their national duty.
This thing is only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this is the subject that we should address.
We knew that the Government had been trying to do much, such as launching terromons or organizing fast dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing of the possibility to solve this problem, namely, make the rap?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore is the one who does not understand this in such a light mind.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The State package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for the child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all of this has a low-efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and highly technological city State in South-East Asia, also known for its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
For the last time, it was lower than 2, which is known as the percentage of substitution, in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans don't have more children?
Tan Way Min, Director of the Policy Office for Marriage and Family of the National Population Authority, says that the reason for “perfect education” and “more gamma career opportunities”.
“This has enabled people to have a broader range of options in terms of living goals and priorities other than marriage and family creation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of idle couples and the postponement of marriages and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the fertility rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, immigration policy, which aims to sharply increase immigration in order to counteract the decline in the population, is a source of indignation among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where there are barely hidden xenophobia for many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for low-level wages and reluctance to integrate.
Immigration growth is also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore ' s ruling party received the worst results last year in elections since independence.
After the elections, an attempt was made to address the problem through quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the decline in fertility has a well-known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, medical costs and immigration policies, Singapore ' s example is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government is making efforts not to build so many small housing.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has been monitored by the number of small houses known as the "built box" that can be constructed in certain areas of the city.
These apartments, which are 46 square metres, are sold very well.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to a single lifestyle and deprive developers of incentives to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, Director-General of the EL Developers Domestic Company, says that their "built boxes" are sold much faster than more spatial copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are to be bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash revenues are increasing.
Nevertheless, it recognizes that new rules provide clearer guidance for developers who had previously been struggling to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too heavy
Singapore is a city State.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans working in the centre's financial quarter, they do not seem to have a special effect.
"People are very overcrowded, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of that, many people are delaying it," says the young steward.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important for me to have your own money and time," says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter what the Government's attempt to encourage its citizens to be born, with regard to childbirth, the last word remains for Singaporeans.
Online Personal - Online
Confidentiality.
According to the Royal Academy of Spanish, it is the property of private or “the sphere of personal life that is entitled to protect against any interference”.
What is personal for minors under 16 years of age?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that are being put on the Internet when discussing situations that are not likely to be shared outside the Internet?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys from 10 to 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very mine," in a personal plane, and "paraol and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I wouldn't have downloaded to my post," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has been recording for two years.
"These are very secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he claims.
On FB, I'm loading beautiful pictures or play pictures.
I also have fun with my friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine or someone who behaves stupid," he says.
The boy realizes that it is not good to publish images of naked people, crimes, or insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assures him he knows 35 friends he has in FB and nine of his Follocks on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows, she has a password for one of the accounts.
I brought Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I'm answering, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to far-reached relatives or to my friends quickly," he says.
Without wondering, he answers that he would never have accepted a request from a stranger.
Wouldn't be treated with someone who would recommend him to a stranger.
José's 14-year-old case is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last, he admits that he doesn't know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one came to him with confidence or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I get pressured or demanded, I'll just remove them from my account," he admits.
José became a follow-up Ask after reading the Twitter recommendation.
The boy's not strange to the experience of what is known today as cybermobing.
One of my friend's friends was blackmailing on the social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not remove the record.
"Only included confidentiality."
He then explains the sequence of steps to set up the accounting in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would download photographs of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if the person I don't like or if I want to.
"Would I know it's cyberbebing," he confirms.
Key issues
Marílos Porrás, an English teacher and an educator, believes that sending children and adolescents should be understood that social networks are intended to be informed.
"The internet came up as a tool to find information, but with these websites, the rules of the game changed," she notes.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prinski, a teacher of the Yale University and the author of the work of the Digital Aboriginal and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital Aboriginals are they, children and young people who were born in an age of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that the subject is difficult, "because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be disseminated, published or spoken, at a age when maturity is not enough to do so."
"So that they are voted, while it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that children and adolescents are confidential is to ask questions that cause them to reflect.
"Tell them not to do this, it's useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to get a picture of you like the one you published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign pictures of parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one thing, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to let them realize that they have to act online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“On the Internet, a person behaves respectfully, with responsibility and other principles, and must also be in social networks,” she claims.
Due diligence
Estoardo Guardia, university teacher, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to read social networks in good faith.
Understanding each paragraph, they have good grounds for talking to children about the assumptions of opening an Internet account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to spread or publish," he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key question is to remind the children of the lesson: "Don't talk to strangers."
UNASUR Summit ends without announcement of the Lima Declaration
VI The Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the proclamation of the Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe had repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be transmitted after the closure, but had subsequently confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
Concerning questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were made by President Olyant Umala of Peru during the short statements for the press.
Journalists have always been limited to the Summit information.
During the day only was broadcast, in the press hall, a video of the Presidential Assembly without a sound saying, "Closed meeting, sound is forbidden."
The few information that was circulating among the reporters was transmitted by the Spokespersons of some UNASUR Governments who were present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which caused hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more information.
Subsequently, the Office of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the “final declaration” of the summit, but it was Umala's statement, not the official document to be concluded by the summit.
In October last, Peru had adopted the III Summit of the South American and Arab Countries (ASPA) and, despite its insistence on the press, the so-called Lim Declaration, which had previously been announced, had not been distributed.
On the official ASPA website, it is possible to verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have made efforts to ensure that all journalists receive transmission systems, but have maximized the availability of information.
The Summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which settles the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olyanta Umala and Chile, Sebastian Piniera, met at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice, which would begin on Monday in The Hague the hearing of the statements of both parties, as part of the prosecution that Lima put against Santiago.
“We will respect and comply with a decision that will explain the differences we are currently submitting to this international court,” said Umala, next to his Chilean colleague.
“Child was, is, and will be a country respecting international law, peaceful resolution of differences, Covenants and international tribunals”, added Pinier, and welcoming Umal ' s hands against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they are subject to the International Court of Justice took place immediately after Colombia challenged the Bogot Pact this week, according to which it recognized the subordination to the verdicts of that international court after the decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua, which it considered to be wrong.
The Summit was held in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rusef, Venezuela, Hugo Chaves, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impression of his former President Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The President, Olyanta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, a little later than noon on the Lima Time.
The Head of State read the outcome document, which reported that 16 agreements had been adopted and had been approved for 31 projects among the South American countries, an estimated investment amounted to $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR would take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residential agreements”.
He reported that action was being taken to improve “citizens' cooperation against insecurity and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase access to medicines, affordable access to the Internet in all parts of South America and to take into account the combined and effective risks of natural disasters”.
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis but should serve to expand our productive framework and foresee a better future for our cities”, Umala added.
“We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 marking projects that would improve South America's linkage, especially in village and border zones... by bringing our countries together and creating new economic schemes,” said the Peruvian President in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five were Peru and were limited to cross-cutting points in his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two were aimed at much communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide further details.
The outcome document also addressed the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve as its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is now excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In that regard, President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia, before taking part in the regional meeting, said that he hoped to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet President Daniel Ortega after the tears of Saturday," said Santos.
“We shall revise all these paths, and they will not be mutually excluding, including the Nicaraguan Covenant, to be discussed with Nicaragua,” he stressed.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we can deal with it in the best possible civilized and respectful manner," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they will be able to attend the post of the new President of that country, Enrique Penja Nieto.
Also at the summit, the defence ministers met provisionally to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay constitute UNASUR, although the latter ' s participation has been suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America should learn from Europe on the issue of citizenship integration”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of general citizenship was a goal in which “South America, in this case, should learn from Europe”.
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, stated to Peru's State television that the Europeans “have killed each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one home”.
It has protected, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which endorses the States parties to UNASUR.
"It is necessary to ensure the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is the case with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactive sectors that want us back in the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also been a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and of those who have signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lectures never take on any obligations, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is unclear that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States,” he said, pointing to the political asylum provided by Ecuador by the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured him that he did not regret the decision because he did not give up his principles but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights”.
He added that, in due course, “there were some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be respected”.
He has also criticized Swedish justice for the requirement to come to his territory for interrogation concerning the alleged sexual offence, while “Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Embassy of Ecuador in London”.
Correa confirmed that Assanja's physical and mental health was at risk.
"I haven't talked to him since he came to our embassy, but the Ambassador told me that he had a little lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of State.
What's true is the risk of deteriorating his physical and mental health because he's in a small space without being able to exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any human," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the Assange asylum problem granted since June in the Equatorian Embassy in London, through the provision of a security guarantee that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the founding of WikiLeaks.
We have not negotiated human rights; we have not used that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
“The decision of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, because Assanja lawyer Baltasar Harson is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
And he said that "if Britain will provide security tomorrow, it will end."
And if Sweden, as well as its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Señor Assanja in the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him on Skype, tomorrow the problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to show himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he did not endure “the mediation, insolence and lies that distort freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of the freedom of the press are not corrupt politicians, but bad journalists who support gains, blackmails and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he was pleased that neither those journalists, “the bankers, nor the bourgeois-gehemon countries do not dominate Ecuador”, and added that by being re-elected, would “increase the revolution for the continuation of development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto of Paraguay in UNASUR at least before the next elections, stating that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and support of the riots under the mask of law”, because, in fact, “the rule of law of Paraguay's democracy had been destroyed”.
The Ecuadorian President also considered the “perfect” desire of his Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which had benefited from Nicaragua ' s maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not yet respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
They must be processed together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope that the dispute on maritime boundaries that took place in the same court of Peru and Chile would have been well concluded, and said that “it was right for Latin America to apply to international authorities if two countries committed to making a decision, no matter how difficult it was”.
With regard to the opportunity to speak as a candidate for the upcoming Presidential elections in Ecuador to be balloted for a third consecutive period, he indicated that he was considering this opportunity “with great optimism and joy, although it was sometimes difficult”.
Correa assured him that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
In my personal sense, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be corrected only by the political authorities.
"My political movement felt that it was me that I had guaranteed this probable victory, so I had to accept that responsibility," he said.
In the event of victory, this would be my last term of office as President and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"This is the solution," he confirmed.
Correa also referred to a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuela's Vice President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he had gone to treatment that had already been planned, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the deterioration of President Chavez's health," he explained.
The Head of the Ecuadorian State participated today in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which culminated in calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
The factory was 21 when it was announced that his AIDS analysis had a positive effect.
"It's like I've been deafed," he recalls that hard, despite all the doctor's tact, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to know as much as possible and his efforts were justified - he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabricio is one of the “oldest” HIV patients in the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG) Hospital, to which he reached many obstacles in 1994.
He has been living with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for the past 22 years.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection clinic didn't want to say goodbye to him, "because he had cuts."
In other words, at those times having AIDS was a verdict.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to do it without the deteriorating quality of life.
However, without knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus is already in damaging, have depleted their immune system and they are exposed to opportunistic infections.
After 31 years of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “the greatest achievement is that the survival of a patient who starts to treat in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” said HCG Head of HIV, Heime Andrade Viljanoweva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in the prestigious scientific edition in April of this year.
Infectious and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that, since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but that the duration and quality of life depend on the extent to which the immune system is defeated at the beginning of the diagnosis, with a better life expectancy for those who do not use drugs, up to 30 years with 200 CD4 and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 are reported.
Simply put, the foregoing means that the person who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25 according to these terms, “with control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans now averages 76 years.
While the death rate has declined significantly in recent years, in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), as well as that since AIDS, 60 per cent of patients have died in the national database.
In Khalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and 187 died by May this year; however, there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why do we still have the fatal outcome?
- In person, I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I imagine things in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have had no lack of medicine, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their infection, that is, at the late stages of the disease.
He reported the deplorable data: “Nine out of ten patients come when they already have any opportunistic infection; what must be done to have a greater impact on the overall mortality rate, thus conducting diagnosis at an early stage, and so it is necessary to provide samples for mass detection, for all the people who ask for it.”
The proposal concurs with the opinions of experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Khalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as the Fabricio, who had turned to a private laboratory that was only motivated by his friend and, despite his young age, had already been at the stage of AIDS and had even suffered from a Sark Caposha, a common complication.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they'll die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I still die, I'd rather wear three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do exercise, I take drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, have an active sex life, but with a mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and of another person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are now in the context of World AIDS Day.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV positive, so better, and if they already have diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person who is responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this 2012.
Target condoms
The great gap between health-care programmes and a simple citizen is believed by Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalahara who dealt with HIV-related issues.
And this is the biggest prevention.
In places devoted to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given hundreds of packages, and that's very good, but it turns out there are those who still have no access to the condom," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why do you?" is a popular question, with ridicule and condemnation, by social workers, school counsellors, pharmacies and health workers who don't want to hear teenagers, assured the propagandist.
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that the condoms be not only on the tacks and that a hundred of them be in public toilet machines in places that are often visited by young people.
It's not a promotion of loose conduct.
It was not about the payment of beer and motel, and the Governor, Emilio González, replied when he was asked whether the condoms could be distributed under his leadership.
"It's not sexuality, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Khalisco
A total of 13,435 cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) have been registered.
The State ranks four in the national rating on new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th on HIV.
92 per cent of infections relate to sex, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to perinatal paths.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are between 4 and 5 people who do not know about it in one registered case.
In view of the ratification by the United States Court of Appeal of a decision that cancels the restructuring of the Vitro Group ' s debt through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a rocket precedent for any national company with affiliates in a neighbouring country that has problems with payment capacity.
It appears that procedures in support of the survival of firms allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of strips and stars in contradiction with international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of the decision of Judge Harlin Hayle on 15 June before a court of bankruptcy in the northern district of Texas leaves the Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the side of Rio Grande.
However, the decision opens the doors to the leader of the glass in Mexico for referral to the Supreme Court of the United States, arguing three inconsistencies.
As an entry, while the judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth District, located in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings concerned competitive proceedings in Mexico.
The first paragraph implied the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of incapacity of transnational enterprises.
In fact, to that end, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was established, defining as an arbitrator the American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an inter-firm ballot recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt that the branches of Vitro had before the parent company would not have achieved the majority necessary for restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples of Agremex and Comercial Mexicoa, whose inter-firm debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing.
It is also true that by deciding on the votes of the affiliates, Vitro creditors who fought against him in the United States courts, namely, the “sterlet funds” like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent, against 37.
The data are dismissed by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that that had experienced since 2008, which had been affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States had encountered, with its impact on the country.
In the meantime, the family firm González Sad will appeal the judgement to the Court of Appeal itself so that the vote will reach his plenary, that is, five judges, because only three have voted.
In the event of failure, an application will be made for a certificate that will require a review of the trial by the High Court, in the case of the United States Supreme Court.
Worse yet, the court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico as an amicus curiae (“other court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro in the framework of the Competitive Proceedings Act, indicating that it frees itself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has been subordinated to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of incapacity to pay, which guarantee equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Two-board carambole: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
In view of the months deferred complaints placed on the table by Mexicana de Aviacion against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union of Aviatri Pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
Carlos Dias Chávez Morino, headed by the authorities, has just submitted a criminal case against the National Banks and Securities Commission, which is accused of impediment to justice.
Accordingly, the oversight body systematically refused to report to the Office of the Attorney-General of the Republic on the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from F/589 Bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of Mexicoa Airlines.
Resources would be devoted to the purchase of shares of the Professional hotel manager ' s company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel network.
Dragon Mart Environment
At the forum weekends at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society endorsed the establishment of a broad front to counteract the discovery of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We're talking, as you know, about the giant sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the isolated country, with a living zone nearby for 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra was able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone in order to counter the monumental forces, which have levelled the land of the protected territories and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death of ACTA
In relation to the Government ' s demand for the Senate to explain the circumstances and circumstances under which the Ambassador of Mexico to Japan signed a trade agreement against counterfeiting known as the abbreviation in English ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, this case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of viewing it as a violation of freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to repay long-term debts without affecting short-term homex housing, the homex builder places Brought certificates for 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with a proposal to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival comes to light
NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, information technology leaders, a competival consortium with trade name has just emerged, and its goal will be the market for software clusters in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector Hatin Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
A busy basketball traveler, Hector Hetin Reyes, was more than 60 years connected to this sport and, thanks to it, traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector Hatin Reyes.
And before bleeding into the brain in 2008, Reyes had been involved in sports for more than 60 years, as a player in small categories, the High Basketball League player, the Commissioner and Head of BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamon and the President of the Basketball Federation.
“I have played a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including a few at the same time as when I was President BSN, the Director General of the National Team and President of the Federation in the 1990s,” recalls Reyes during his visit to Prima Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorials assembled for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the Heart
With the greatest emotion, he retains those who remember his journey through Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when his 15-year-old speech as a contract agent or agent.
"It was my best years that I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboy champions since 1967, as an agent, an agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five champions from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsey's debut in BSN.
From that point on, Cuco Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has continued to be the leader, said Reyes.
I remember that Jean Bartow, who was on his way to Alabama University, Birmingham, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, 6'7."
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Minsie, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended a sniper Rymond Gauss, who got citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the Bayamon championship, Gauss would help win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboy championship with Gauss, but I was far away, because by 1988 I was the chief of the federation.
By that time, I had preferred to enjoy its achievements and achievements in the national assembly of Minsi.
I remember the first time we won the U.S. during the Olympic Qualification Tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Championship, where we got our fourth seat and it was to be a bronze, if it weren't for the Canadian judge who had forced us to play the final game, said Reyes.
The 1990 World Championship team is the best collection you've ever seen?
She's among the best, as well as the one that won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that with the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. assembly, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze on the world championship.
Not only did the team again play Minsi, Gaussas, Ramona Rivas, Fico Lopes and Pikulina (Orticus), but also young (havier) Toñito's Colon and James Carter, Leon Brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Chihote' Morales, who was unable to participate in 90 due to knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the 1995 Olympic Qualification Tournament team in Neuken, Argentina.
With Role Players like Canito Nyves, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Khurruitner in exchange for players who were temporarily suspended for riot at the Pan American championship Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all the predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt it was Pickulin Ortiz.
Its indicators on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level as Pickulin did.
And it's without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he was playing.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very difficult question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love Leo Arilla's work from young people.
What do you think is your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most famous era of national assembly between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff.
Now, guys travel and play too much, and that's unnecessary.
At least I see the results of mandatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It makes me enjoyable.
What are you doing now?
Most of all, I'm listening to music, watching music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren, and most of the time I go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the society of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Dead actress Larry Hegman
Larry Hegman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Wart (Tehas), became world-wide known for his primary role as John Ross Yugh, more known as J.R., in the Dallas television series in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hegman, whose role as an oil magnate extortioner Jay Ar Yung in the Dallas television series, became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hegmann, who came back this year as J.R. in the new Dallas season, died on Friday night because of complications caused by cancer, according to the family ' s statement given to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown, Dallas, once again playing an important role that he liked most," said his family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at a fair for the Day of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in Sikwell, was next to Hegman when he died in Dallas hospital, said to her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was the original person and lived full of life," confirmed Gray in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had been drinking for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumor in the liver and had transplantated.
Long before Dallas, Hegman gained his reputation on television because of the role of a decent type in a light - colored comedy called I Dream of Jeannie, which was broadcast by channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut, whose life changes when he meets the attractive gin girl that Barbara Iden plays, and starts living with her under one roof.
He was also the chief character of two comedies that rarely appeared in the air, the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and the "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included the roles well-adopted by critics in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterly interpretation of the striking abhorrent J.R. that led Hegman to the top of fame.
The CBS Dramatic Channel series on the Yung Clan and other characters in its surroundings was on the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who Shooted in J.R." designed to create a noise around an episode, full of emotion in which Hegman's character is almost killed, created international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked by the bookmaker offices.
It also helped to attract a record audience at that time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million telegraphers watched it and turned Dallas into a second count of entertainment in history, after MASH's final in 1983, which attracted 50 million spectators.
It was J.R., Christine (in the execution of Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. hindered her and then threatened her to accuse her of prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hegman played Yugh as an unsatisfactory corrupter with charismaic smile: an unfair entrepreneur and a disloyal husband who wanted his wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be treated.
"I know what must be on the J.R tomb plate," said Hegman in 1988.
It must be said, “The right here is an honest citizen of J.R. Yuing.”
It's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principle, also a hero of the original Serial, remembered on Friday, Hegman, both "the big one, both on and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of worshipers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been happy to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas release were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season was already completed and the sixth was in production, reported by the channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made statements that will be with the Hegman after he left.
Fort-Wert, Texas, he was the son of an actress and the singer Mary Martin, who glistened in classical works such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave him birth in 1931 during her marriage with Ben Hegman, a lawyer.
He tried to be happy at the theater scenes in New York in the early 1950s and then served in the BBC of England from 1952 to 1956.
When he was there, he met a young Swedish artist named Mi Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he called his "Hello Darlin": Tall (and absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I did not include anything that would feel capable of causing pain to anyone or affecting them in any way," he said at the time.
After the liver was transplanted, he promoted the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer at the hospital to help the feared patients.
"I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go to surgery, and after," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Starts a course that is being studied by the End of Light.
Students are studying apocalyptic phenomena every week, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of the religion of Stuart Sharma decided to read the course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an inevitable bait: the end of the Maya's long backward calendar, on December 21, which many people took for as evidence that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharm had no idea what was expected of him in the next few months: the catastrophic hurricane of Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call long-term armageddon, and the growing conflict that would engulf Israel, where the Christian theorists of the end of time believed that the Apocalypse would begin.
"I didn't realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all," Sharm said this week to the Ruthgers-Camden University students (New Jersey).
If we look at what is happening in the world today, as if we had only 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad things are good for those who have apocalyptic thinking.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "the end of the world" in this sevenstery, theoretically last in history.
At the University of Temple, Professor Barry Wakeer reads the course “The Media, Culture and End of the World”.
Students are studying apocalyptic topics every week, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas are being spread over time," he said, and the way in which the hypothetical scenarios of certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic topics and studied how they relate to examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students what might be true and impossible," said Wakeer.
In the main course of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History, Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art and anthropology, joined together to read a course called simply "Light End".
"We don't add '2012' to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world does not come," said Restall.
Despite “nominal destruction”, students must learn, prepare projects and pass final examinations.
In the state of Penn, the final examination will be taken to the Apocalypse Canon, which leaves no choice for students except to work “before the very night that the end of the world is expected to come,” said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"Vengeance ended in two hours," said Restall about his high middle score course for 35 students.
We received e-mail messages many weeks before the semester started with people who asked if there were any more rooms.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridged Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Hadddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old psychologist and nursery student, said that he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach it," he noticed.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed -- let alone the professor -- said he believed at the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched on Maya's prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has been a number of centuries where people react to changes around themselves in predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Preferably in an English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerty, professor of the religion of the University of La Sal, who was teaching courses in the Philippines this year, promptly answered the question of whether he knew of any course on the end of light there.
“Philippines do not participate at the end of the world,” he wrote, pointing to the superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time, many of the days of the last court had been mentioned, and said that if nothing happened on 21 December, “people would immediately begin to think about the next date” or philosophize that 21 December was the beginning of a seven-year period upon which the world would end.
Students and teachers are not careful about this date.
Some said they were going to go to the party "Light End."
"Maybe I'll call a friend to laugh together," she commented to Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Telecommunication Faculty.
