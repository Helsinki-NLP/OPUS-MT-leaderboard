Two men committed suicide in Kineshma and the district
Earlier one of the hangings had attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1 to 00, in the village of Lugovaau, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to do that is unknown.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, a 41-year-old man living in Kineshma killed his life.
No signs of forced death have been detected, reports the Ministry of Internal Affairs press service “Kinhemski”.
You got a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair the dispersed road system, many are beginning to see the decision in a little black box carefully fitted on your car's panel.
These devices, which monitor each mile pass and transmit this information to the officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the old American highway financing system, undertaken by the planners of Washington and the State.
Usually, the boring scene of the planning of motorways has suddenly given rise to intensive debates and colorful alliances.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in lobbying the Government ' s right to use small barleys to track the number of miles you travel, and perhaps even where you travel, and then using this information in the preparation of tax accounts.
The teashire movement is shocking.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues about private life.
Although the congress is still unable to agree, to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They reflect on how the next decade can be moved to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes to test, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is indeed necessary for our country.
“This is not the question on which we may have the right to choose,” said Hassan Iirrat, Executive Director of the Association of Government of Southern California, who is preparing plans to start tracking by the authorities of the state of the miles travelled by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There's already technology for that.
The need to do so is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government ' s Highways Foundation, financed by the taxes paid by Americans on the autofills.
Americans don't buy as much petrol as they used to.
Cars travel more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes by even one cent at high petrol prices.
“The gas tax cannot be retained, ” said Le Mannić, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on the vehicles to test the fee system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long term, ” he said.
They call it a favorite user wage.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce the congestion of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planning bodies in California are looking at this system in developing strategies to achieve the targets established by the state's ambitious laws to combat global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives, Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Chamber, said that he also viewed the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Free Marketers at Reason are also thrilled to make drivers pay for each mile.
“It is not just a tax that will go to a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. Ministers of Transport, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a parole.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving about 10,000 vehicles.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who often travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
A number of states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the State of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are being recruited for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of run instead of taxing gasoline.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
He is under consideration in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
The I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 states of the eastern coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could track every step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alauddin Khan, leader of strategy and efficiency management in the Nevada Transport Department.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the trials were under way, the American Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably be expanded to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where there are difficult searches for low-cost technologies that would allow state authorities to keep track of car-mills but without information about place and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
The company initially failed to assist in the collection of State taxes.
It sought to reach the developing market of the type of road insurance where drivers paid on the basis of a run.
But the devices she tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information downloaded periodically through a modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this unless you track their speed and not track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
Some major mistakes were made in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less binding ways to do so.
In Oregon, engineers are experimenting with options for drivers.
They can select a device from or without GPS.
Or they may completely abandon the device by deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles travelling by all the inhabitants of the state.
In other places, it is hoped that the idea will be sold to the public by making the devices do more and not less.
In New York, transport officials seek to develop a taxation device that will also be paid by parking counters, provide “payments as you ride” insurance and collect real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid failure.
“Attomobilists will engage in the benefit they will be offered,” says the city design document.
Some of the designers of transport systems, however, are wondering whether all the conversations about parole are simply a huge distraction.
At the City Transport Commission in the Gulf of San Francisco, officials say that Congress could easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Highways by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgical intervention when everything you need to do is to accept aspirin, ” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be concerned about their private life and many other things.
The EU is preparing support to Ukraine in the case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide Ukrainian gas, as well as an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit if Russia takes any action in response to possible signature of the EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are under way with the IMF for a standby loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their aim is to conclude an agreement soon.
In addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can obtain Euro610 million from the EU itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome long-standing differences about funding conditions.
There is no belief in the possibility of reforms needed to obtain assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which reduced the Ukrainian sovereign rating to one degree, to “B-” from “B” on Friday.
However, EU representatives said that IMF could show flexibility in lending, taking into account Ukraine ' s circumstances.
In addition to the country ' s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve for Ukrainian gas, the vast majority of which is now from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be a "North Flow" gas or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia is "isolating" Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this mode of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and will likely lead to a decrease in delivery to other regions.
“The EU and Ukrainian countries are negotiating how to create favourable conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” added the Reuter source.
Russia out of the city pollution control of cars
Efforts have been made to address the transport problems of major cities in most of the world ' s megapolis since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a general rule, they were either restructured and expanded, or attempted to reduce the demand for road travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
The example of Singapore is widely known, with strict quotations for the increase in private cars and their right to purchase in auctions.
His price may be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced the fee for entering the centre of the city.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green areas are introduced to allow entry only to certain eco-lasses using high-quality fuels (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Agency for the Environment of Beijing, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year net air plan” of about 250 billion Yuan (about $40 billion).
As reported by the Director of the Transport Pollution Control Division of the Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, Beijing Le Kunsheng, the main goal of the five-year-old is to reduce the lead air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, to increase the number of private vehicles to not more than 6 million (now 5.2 million), and to increase by no more than 5 per cent of the fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, transport in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
The main measures of the programme include limiting the use of road transport, as well as imposing additional taxes on owners.
Among other things, the urban “5-year-old” measures include accelerated transition to Euro-standard fuels, the introduction of local eco-standards and vehicle and fuel marking, the limitation on the entry of vehicles to the central part of the city, the prohibition on obsolete vehicles (except for the establishment of incentive financial replacement programmes for old vehicles to hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric transport (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Pekina ' s autonomy also includes a ban on all private cars within the fifth transport ring (all in the capital of the CPD of them six) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the vehicle plate) and the issuance of lottery-based registration marks (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only one third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state programme on Environment for 2012-2020, the number of high and very high air pollution cities should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Minnature, in 2011, “movable sources” accounted for 41 per cent of all pollutants emissions in the urban atmosphere.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from vehicles are ten times higher than industrial and in St. Petersburg are nine times.
In the RF, the possibility of restrictive regulation on the streets of cities is still under way.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of WSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road travel are not widely known, can only be adopted by society if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters that are not sensitive to any regulatory impacts - service and personal vehicles, as well as “privileged” users, whose total number is not less than 200,000 (about 5 per cent of the total Moscow car park).
During the days, urbanists from the ECOM Centre in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyses the balance of urban territories between housing, road cover and traffic.
The main findings of researchers: the city centre is provided with roads twice as low as required, and most of the roads residing in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on long-term parking or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking, but rather to expand, but to reduce the carriageway (to make the streets more friendly to pedestrians) and to limit the use and placement of personal transport at the borders of the security area of the historic centre (the total area of about 3,212 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Warfare for unauthorized street trade in Woolden will grow once more
According to the urban authorities, the increase in fines would help bring about order in Volody and free streets from natural tents and slots.
Most street dealers do not pay taxes, the products they implement are often not subject to related sanitary control.
This means that wetness is threatened.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times, from 500 roubles to 3,000 roubles, reports the Voloda Press Service.
Goldman Sachs warned about risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of increasing risks for the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment for unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions of employees.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it's completely driven by consumption, which is almost unabated”, said the chief economist, Goldman Sachs, for Russia, Clemens Graffe, presenting yesterday an investment bank account on the Russian economy.
The nominal increase in wages in Russia is now about 10%.
In inflation, 6 per cent will be able to provide future consumer demand at the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to be optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the wage rate in GDP: if the wages increase by 10 per cent, GDP only by 2 per cent, explained Mr. Graphe.
Companies have experienced a decline in cost-effectiveness.
If she does not grow up, this can lead to dismissal and increased unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise the wages, comments the chief economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment is close to historical minimums, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure the employees on the side or to retain the current, employers have to raise their wages.
Consumption in Russia is also supported by a very rapid increase in demand.
Mr. Graphe said that because of the extremely high consumer interest rates, this type of lending did not affect the country's economy.
"We didn't see any benefits for the economy from increasing demand, money doesn't go to the economy, but return to the same banks as interest payments," said the economist.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs expects to grow on unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by the poor, who have nothing to provide.
Interest for such loans is high.
As a result, they are not more likely to be returned," said Mr. Graphe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is the possible non-payment crisis on unsecured credits.
The Director of the Banking Institute, VSHE Vasili Slavkov, is already seeing signs of a escalating banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the low-cost resources available to the public, were forced to attract high-percent population funds.
In response, the state went to the war tremors and reduced credit rates, and the economist continues.
Small credit organizations cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have negative interest margins.
If the Mississippi refuses the Dumping, Russia faces a full banking crisis, Vasili Sweetkov believes.
The deprivation of licences from a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers it a precursor of mass collapse.
“The state will not cope with this situation: the investment insurance system has not originally been designed for a systemic crisis”, warns the head of the Institute.
But the growth in consumption will slow down without the crisis of non-payment, believed in the Investment Bank, owing to the refusal to index the salaries of the public servants and the military as set out in the current budget version.
In part, consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of natural monopoly tariffs (and consequently the decline in inflation).
But only partly: if investment does not grow (and the prerequisite is not yet available - see the background), the growth of consumption will still slow down, assured by Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Panthusin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen the prerequisite for pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a fall in the oil price," he says.
He estimated that Russia ' s economy would start to decline at the cost of oil below $90/bar.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CBC is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
Paradoxically, inflation has declined and banks have begun to raise rates.
This may mean that they have not believed the CB that has declared a transition to inflation,” said Clemens Graff.
The Central Bank policy on market rates does not affect, it only affects inter-bank credit rates.
"For the CB, it's a collapse of hopes," I appreciated Clemens County.
Money received in CBA auctions, banks use not to credit the economy but to manage their liquidity
As the rate decreases, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“Rano or later the CB will understand that this strategy is not working,” said Mr. Graphe and recalled that the State was planning to launch a rouble in the “free navigation” by the end of 2015.
But it will have to do it before, or raise the key rate of the CB (5.5%), he thinks.
He estimated that the rouble was now artificially high by 10 per cent.
Only one road is weakened, the expert concludes.
But if the CB's financiers' shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the cut-off policy, it might be much stronger.
In Chelbinsk, there was the second assembly of the peoples of South Ural.
The Forum is tied to the Day of People ' s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian Statehood and the 20th anniversary of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and areas, national cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies attended the convention, a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening the international agreement.
We can show examples not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," states Theophan, Mitropolitan of Chelabins and Zlateustski.
The meeting addressed a number of issues, including patriotism, cultural cooperation.
Following the convention, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
The national cultural associations of the Chelabin region have been opened here.
Cnowden is ready to collaborate with Germany on the question of United States exploration
Edward Snowen, the explorator of the U.S. intelligence, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German Parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its Director, Kit Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
The German deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met on Thursday with Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowen, a deputy from the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “While the results of my efforts were obviously positive, my Government continues to view dissent as a change and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection.”
The truth, however, is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowen said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States Government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The accusations filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include spying and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the Interior of Germany, informed Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowen is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so”.
The relationship between the United States and Germany became tense after the allegations that the NSA was listening to the Chancellor Angeles Mercel's phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a deputy head of a parliamentary unit responsible for intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snowen as a witness, “not endangering him or destroying his relations with the United States fully”, it should be used.
Mr. Streuble, parliamentary deputy from the Green German Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbelé said that Mr. Snowen would not have been able to return to Russia if he had left, according to the former contractor ' s lawyer.
If Mr. Snowden had testified in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be there “in security”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had encountered a “grim and constant” campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was inspired by the world ' s reaction to his political statements.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including the United States, felt that the uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance was useful to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge the hand store
Frontier Airlines plans to take off passengers up to $100 for carrying a handwriting on their flight.
The frontier Airlines is planning to charge up to $100 for the hand warehouse and $2 for coffee or gases, although their announcement on Wednesday said that passengers would be able to keep the entire bank.
The new fee for the hand warehouse extends to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will be free of charge.
The frontier said it would charge $25 if the charge was paid in advance, and $100 if the travellers were to pay, only when they left the landing.
Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 fee should make the passengers take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it, ” she said.
Airlines began to charge the first and second bags delivered in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees are getting as much as they can in the hand store placed in the upper luggage compartments, which often lacks space in these compartments.
Gathering is one way to force passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new collection isn't really for money.
The fact is, the most loyal customers of the Border claim that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming more difficult.
The passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not be paid.
This means that one passenger in turn at the frontier flight may be able to carry the bag free of charge, while the next passenger in turn may pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the change in procedures on the website and at the frontier rods is intended to guarantee that passengers will know about the gathering before they get to the landing.
The new border fees for the hand warehouse will not begin to be collected until summer, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers often complain of luggage and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that the processing of the luggage is worth money, and passengers who need it must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider the addition of luggage charges to be a sign that airlines charge enough to cover the costs of air travel after several years of loss.
Most of them, however, did not relate to hand warehouse fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first fees for the hand store three years ago, and another dispatcher Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other airline with this fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said Jay Sorensen Air Advisor, who closely monitors the supplementary charges.
According to his report of December 2011, the hand-benefit fees produce the Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorense, former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew by Spirit, and he wondered what he'd find out when he left the landing when the passengers encountered an unusual gathering Spirit for the hand warehouse.
“The landing process was the smoothest thing I ever saw in the airlines for my career, ” he said.
I was hoping to see the dentist and the fight out of the landing.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing went fast."
The frontier also follows the Spirit with respect to the payment of $2 for coffee, tea, gaseous or juice.
The frontier stated that passengers who received gas or juice could leave the entire bank and that the coffee share would be provided free of charge.
It's still going to be free of charge.
US Airways tried shortly to pay for drinks in 2008 but refused to do so seven months after passengers complained and no other large airlines followed her example.
The Frontier ' s Manual Loan Purchase Initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last measure to attract customers to their website.
Airlines pay online sales tickets, like Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
This has given all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, not to go to a tourist online agency.
The Frontier, however, went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, she began to give twice as fewer bonus miles of often flying passengers to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the prize number of miles to 25 per cent of the miles of travel.
For example, a 1,000 - mile - long trip from the Frontier from an online tourist agency would allow 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can only select a place in advance if they buy tickets directly on the border site.
The Frontier has a base of loyal clients in her hometown of Denver, but her business is going down and getting lost.
The benefit decreased by 9 per cent, and summer opportunities decreased by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published on Wednesday by the Parents' Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to recover the border finances as part of the sale of airlines.
The NSA blames the “inner error” rather than the hackers for the cessation of the site
The secret Agency for National Security announced on Friday night that the termination of their site had caused a technical failure for hours rather than hackers, as reported on the network.
“NSA.gov was inaccessible for a few hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planned update,” reported the intelligence agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the interruption was caused by a distributed attack of type “refusal in service” [DDoS] are not correct.
Previously, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA site did not operate at least six hours, and the site was still not available to some users.
ABC News had previously reported to ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency had “not” been hacked.
No classified information is at risk, the representative reported.
At least one online hacker group of activists stated that it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA site with DDoS-attacks.
DDoS-attacks are designed to engulf the site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once known as “No such Agency”, has been at the centre of public attention in recent months and severely criticized after the revelations of its extensive overseas and domestic surveillance programmes, is all a response to the secret files of the NSAs stolen from the agency and published by disappointed former staff member NSA EAN Edward Snowen.
The growing debate around the agency has prompted the fact that the current incident was the result of targeted hackers.
Bombardier ' s arrival decreased as the shipments fell and the number of orders ordered on aircraft
The Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent reduction in net profits on Thursday as a result of the reduced number of orders and shipments of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The company Bombardier, located in Montreal, has also not published any data on its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether an ambitious plan would be implemented for the commercial operation of the aircraft by the next September.
Following the first flight of an experienced aircraft sample, which took place about one and a half months ago, he flew only three times, raising questions as to whether the graphing phase was in progress.
The results have not justified the projections and have led to more than 8 per cent drops in the Toronto Foundation Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, a National Bank Financial analyst, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher average market” to “medium” because of the belief that the growth of shares is limited in the nearest quarter or two.
“While reducing the number of air ships was generally predictable, we are undoubtedly disappointed by the transport department’s returns,” said Doerksen in the stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will get new CSeries orders as the summer test program continues.
However, unless new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries plane family will allow her to gain a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first test sample of the aircraft was submitted in March and flyed for the first time in September after several months of delay.
However, firm CSeries orders are not yet too many — 177 because potential buyers are waiting for summer test results to verify the company ' s claims for fuel efficiency and potential cost-effectiveness of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Bodouan, was confident that Bombardier would achieve its target at 300 hard orders at the time the first aircraft would be launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured the analysts and the media that the programme was moving forward.
“The test model of the aircraft did not remain on earth longer than expected, ” said Bodouan during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during a simple aircraft.
All manufacturers plan the tests in different ways.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break to update, so we did.
This will take place throughout the summer test programme.
The second of the five test samples should fly in the coming weeks, and all the others would soon follow it as reported by the company.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the claim that the first client will be able to operate the CSeries aircraft 12 months after his first flight.
Bombardier stated that it was assessing the deadline for operationalization and would provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of summer testing, although apparently consistent with the Bombardier internal schedule, supports our view that the introduction to operation will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ending on 30 September, Bombardier's net income decreased to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted profits for the share remained nine cents.
Gross income decreased slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts were expected to earn 10 cents on share and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that he had placed 45 aircraft per quarter, which was less than the previous year 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The space office portfolio was $32.9 billion as of 30 September, without changing since 31 December.
“In the aerospace area, the results met our objectives, but the small number of orders received and the general market conditions became a negative factor,” said Bodouan.
Gross proceeds from air space have fallen by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest train manufacturer in the world, reported that gross income in this sector rose by almost 11 per cent — to $2.1 billion.
The order portfolio in the transport unit was 32.6 billion by 30 September, slightly higher than the 31 December.
The income of the transport unit has had a negative impact on the implementation of several major contracts.
Management stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's shares, which also announced that the principal financial director of Google Patrick Pichet would join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to the P4.83 in the middle of Thursday bidding.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the nearest Bombardier competitor, reported a 10 per cent reduction in quarterly income on Thursday.
Sony expects lower annual profits
The Japanese Electronic Manufacturer, Sony, completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, reduced the projection of profits in the current financial year.
Sony’s results during the period from July to September 2013 were more grieved than expected because of the fall in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers for the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, in the second quarter, brought the first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, fell again to 9.3 billion ions of operational losses during the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is undergoing difficult times, especially because of reduced demand for televisions.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of the complex situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic corporations, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial packages: the sales of companies are growing at a high rate, especially through road systems and clean technologies.
As a result, by the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects 179 billion dollars of operational profits against the earlier 230 billion yen.
According to the Thomson Reuters agency, analysts suggested that the figure would be significantly higher and would be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding the food line.
In the middle of this month, sales of smart hours were announced from a Japanese corporation with a number of fashionable functions that would make it possible to get the smartphone out of its pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced the annual income and profit forecast, the company's shares in the opening of the Tokyo Tokyo roads were lost more than 11 per cent in the morning, down to 1668 yen for one share.
The gene of speech was the synaptic education stimulator.
Scientists at John Hopkins University and the Maunt Sinai Medical School found a protein that enabled Foxp2 to carry out its function by stimulating new neurons linkages.
The study has been published in Science, and its brief content can be found on the magazine.
Hen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of several people who could not speak correctly and sometimes even did not understand each other.
Scientists found that family members had broken the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how he carried out his function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of Foxp2 ' s functions serve as a stimulator for the development of new synapses in the brain related to speech formation.
It does it because of another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the education of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vaccination has been confirmed by the researchers in the muscular experiment.
When the gene was artificially reduced, the animals were less screaming when they separated from their mother.
If the gene's activity was restored, the frequency of sounds was restored.
Previously, the muscles also had a connection with Foxp2.
Animals that were introduced to a human copy of the gene were more active and at a lower rate than usual mouses.
To date, however, scientists do not know whether the Foxp2 work and the SSRPX2, respectively, are linked to purely “mechanical” sound properties or more subtle processes.
Lawyer with cocaine dependence who warned the chief of the criminal faction about the police investigation, imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Ditta transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarborón
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Royal Court of Liverpool.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a large police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta provided criminal authority to Nile Scarborro secret information on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine dependence.
A lawyer named Bash and called “croat lawyer” was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarborón, which he had previously represented at a drug-related trial.
The officers observed that 32-year-old Scarboro had left three cocaine packets at the lawyer's home in Blackburn County Lankashire while he was at the dinner of the association of lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
During the eight months of January-August 2011, he attempted to obtain illegal information on the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarborór, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were monitored by the police at that time as part of a large investigation into the activities of the crime organization on the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambia, Mercisade, Burkeshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids, amounting to £1.5 million and more than 200,000 in cash.
Ditta ' s 42-year-old reporting to criminals because of the fear that its cocaine dependency would be revealed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors Legal Company in Blackburn, it was disgraced when he was found guilty in two cases of deliberate impediment to the exercise of justice following a three-week trial at the Court of Liverpoola of the Crown.
He confessed to the storage of cocaine at a previous court meeting.
The revelation of the lawyer took place after the police departure of Scarborough found that he had been regularly talking to Ditta on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives were checked for the suspects and found him approaching Ditt's house in Blackburn and putting 60 per cent of drugs in the black glove for the golf under the garbage boxes of the lawyer.
Shortly after the transfer of Scarborough, Ditta was called a lot of time at the dinner of Iwood Stadium, the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; nine conversations took place between them.
The court found that Ditta “regularly used” cocaine after testing detected drug traces of class A in its hair, purse and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said that he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their association was “a legal secret”.
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to extract several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a sample of hair.
During police interrogation, he said that he had a home office alongside his workplace, and the clients came to him in legal cases.
However, the court was aware that after major arrests, he called the largest drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented before the court to tell them that they were known by detectives.
In her indictment, Ann White said: “If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer because he had entered into too close relations with certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations would undoubtedly prove to be lawful because he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely transcended the normal relationship between a lawyer and a client.
It prevented the police from investigating as much as it could to enable them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not respect his profession but dishonored it.
He was too close to certain customers, in particular Scarbororough, and let him question his uninterested interest.
Ditta did not admit his guilt and stated: “If I had been a corrupt lawyer to whom I am not, and would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not have waited for 15 hours, I would have done so without delay.”
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashira police stated: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he begins to acquire drugs from organized crime”.
His cocaine addiction had made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the purposes of the main criminal groups, who had given him valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and impart trust and confidence to society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover himself with his profession.
The investigation of Mr. Diett's case led the Lancashire unit on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already been sentenced to three cocaine cases, and now to prevent the exercise of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
May this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborón himself was convicted for 14 years after confessing his guilt in conspiracy with a view to supplying heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons involved in fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a discussion in the form of questions and answers, in which he said that the work of his dreams was a lawyer representing clients with the death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner was Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work was inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavle was not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, and police officers who attended today ' s CDC meeting were noted.
The ticket programme is, in their view, nearly doubled.
During the 1/16 final Russian Cube with Spartacus, only a thousand stewards were engaged under the regulatory rate of nine thousand.
The Spartacy Hospital had 2,200 seats, 10 per cent of the stadium’s capacity, but, according to the Moscow Club, 5,000 tickets were sold.
These data were reported to the head of KDC Arthur Grigorianz.
Americans listened to Japanese high-level officials
On Friday, 1 November, a representative of the U.S. Special Service who chose not to disclose his name stated that the States had listened to the telephone conversations of Japanese high-level officials.
The man confirmed that there were several points in the land of the rising sun to be heard.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand did not pursue intelligence activities against each other.
He said that this was the case during the Second World War, when those countries were allies.
Japan, like Germany, has reported a telecommunications station NHK despite its post-war relations with Americans.
No party has formally commented on this information yet.
Remember, the news of the U.S. Superintendent's Superintendent for FRG came up last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA was able to listen to Mercel's phone for the last ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took the news of her audition very painfully.
She stated that the allies, in her view, were the FRY and the United States for decades, such monitoring of the head of Government was unacceptable.
In the meantime, Edward Snowen stated that he was prepared to share details of the telephone hearing of Angels Mercel with the German Procurator ' s Office.
Germans had made a special visit to Moscow to meet with a former member of the CIA.
Bachelor's not before the beginning of 2014 can put the grain on the market.
The Bashiriya, during public procurement interventions, may be able to present grains for trade not earlier than the beginning of 2014, is considered by the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to an intervention fund.
While the market price is higher, there is demand.
"Maybe the grain could be put on the bidding, after the New Year," he said at the press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that the current year, crop crops under the 2013 crops were 3.1 million ha, including the cereal area of 1.7 million ha, an increase of 3.3 per cent over the previous year.
A total of 550,000 ha (per 15,000 ha more than in 2012) was sown under the 2014 crop.
The area of winter wheat and triticale has been increased, and the horn remains at the previous level.
There is no Bracy Cluster in the MA bases to which Leps was credited in the United States.
In the databases of the Russian militia group "Bracy", which Washington attributed to the singer Grigory Leps, it is not.
According to Interfax in law enforcement agencies, all databases were checked by the media, but no such groupings were found.
Dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian Mafia”, which is allegedly operating abroad, in force structures.
"Even in the very name, "Bracy", there's some element of mystery, there's a hint on a secret bed.
"It's all very like a pyar action," said the agency interviewer.
On 31 October, the U.S. Ministry of Finance announced that Arthur Badalian, Grigoria Lepsveridze, Wadima Lyalina, Sergei Moscalenko, James Ribal and Igor Shlikov had been placed on its checklists on the suspicion of being a member of the Eurasian criminal syndicate.
The persons listed are suspected of having contact with some Vladivol Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered to be influential members of criminal groups and who have been on United States sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps “is a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev.”
At the Grigory Leps Produce Center, they refused to comment on U.S. charges against the singer, calling them "tree."
In 2011, Barak Obama, President of the United States, identified the Brazilian circle as “existent transnational organized criminal groups” and commissioned the minefin to “drive and prevent their global criminal operations”.
The man's black listings of the United States mines entail the blocking of his assets in the United States and the ban on business contacts with people living in the United States.
The scandal video went to the police.
Head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly folly outlets, came to smoke crack.
The Canadian City Police stated that it had a video recording and was ready to initiate an investigation against the city.
He claimed that he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of the use of drugs by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto Police Web site.
The head of local law enforcement agencies, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
Sheriff said that he was not authorized to share with the public, but he was being handed over for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromising Rob Ford video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid conducted by guards in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had previously written about the existence of this video, but until recently there were no evidence.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He's just saying that he's not guilty of anything and he's not going to retire.
The police video recording is one of the evidence in the case of Ford Alexander Lisie, a 35-year-old friend who is accused of trafficking in light drugs, extortion, gaining illegal income and conspiracy.
At times, Lisie was the driver of Rob Ford.
The city has long been demanding the resignation of its mayor.
He fought journalists repeatedly, appeared in the public in drunkenness, allowed racist and sexist speeches.
OAU “Rostovaroinvest” recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the choice of the projector.
The amount of the company's contract is not disclosed.
According to the OAO press, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the contest, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the State Expertise in spring 2014.
A new airport passenger terminal, as well as infrastructure facilities, inland roads and airport facilities, must be designed.
During the first phase of the construction, the internal area of the terminal would be 50,000 square metres, and it could be further increased.
According to RadioInvest, the project documents will take into account the prospects for the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to service about 5 million passengers and 6 million passengers by 2035.
By the time of the outcome of the tender, the architectural concept of the South Aero-Aero-AeroCadem had been developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The main terminal building project embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov Na-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience with major projects, the company has projected terminals C and E of the International Sheremethiero Airport and the new airport at the Knevići International Airport in Vladivostock.
The South International Airport complex will be built in the Axai area of Rostewa region and will replace the current growth of the Rastov Airport, which will be closed and in the prospect of being integrated into urban buildings.
The launch of the aero-autoxal complex is scheduled for 2014 and the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
The policy in Turkey has declared hunger strikes against the wall at the border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began the construction of a separation wall in the Nusaibin area in south-eastern Turkey.
The local residents and representatives of the PMD Procurd Party strongly opposed the construction.
The Mayor of the Turkish town of Nusaibin Aische Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, reported to RIA Newsty in the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly dispersed protest demonstrations.
The head of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muammer Guler, first challenged the construction, then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaybina Aische Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," said the party's press service.
The city mayor believes that the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of two countries, and the Kurds crossed the border freely for half a century.
"This is a inhuman situation with which the Kurds will never agree," they quote Aisha Hekhan from the party.
According to the press, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nousaibin on 7 November.
Venezuela will establish exchange rates for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, Bolivian, relative to the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on 1 November by the Bloomberg Agency, with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travelers are allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to $10,000 per year.
Venezuela will also allow to sell up to 25 per cent of the bidders acquired in the country at the time of departure.
The specific rate of Bolivia versus the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devaluate the local currency to 6.3 pains per dollar.
However, in the Black Market, one dollar is estimated at 57 Bolivians.
Since the beginning of the year, it has lost nearly 70 percent of its value.
In September, Venezuela had almost 50 per cent of its inflation.
The Minister of Petroleum and Vice-President for the Economics of Rafael Ramirez, on 18 October, stated that Venezuela had no plans to devaluate the bolivar.
According to the informal information brought by the agency, Karakas may still decide to lower the rate of national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing prices for products and products of general consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a number of deficits and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media reported that Venezuela had a shortage of toilet paper.
Andrey Belmach, Director of South-Rail, noted that it is difficult to say how much time it will take to find a new main coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Sheplev.
Resignation took place just a few hours ago, so to say how much time you're gonna need to find a new coach, I'm not ready, and I bring the ITAR TASS Belmacha word.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't just want to find a coach, but a man who's gonna work for a few years at our club and get some results.
Kenyan press is indignant by the media provocative law
“This is a horrible place, and there is reason for the question: What may prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?”
“This law is very severe and punitive and we reject it,” said Sairus Kamau, director of the Capital Group, a capitalFM parent company, which includes one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new judicial body on the media “will always be passionate as it is the continuation of the Government”, and limitations on content and advertising would harm the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
“I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the bill and return to his deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law would essentially allow the Government to “fight the media dead”, and the Standard reported that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya had “had a serious impact” and had criticized the draft law as “Drakonows”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
The Kenyan media angered the authorities by broadcasting records of surveillance cameras where the troops who were sent to the attack allegedly robbed a dear trade centre.
The reaction of the Chief of Police, David Kimayo, was to challenge two journalists and the media official for interrogation, although the challenge was lifted after mass protests by the media.
Under the new law, publishers may be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists may be extra risked to be “excluded from the lists”, that is, to ban official journalism accreditation.
The Court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a destructive effect on the so-called "living blogosphere" of Kenya.
Politicians realize that by making the media shut down, they will be able to do everything they think, without impunity.
“No one will ever know, ” wrote Nation Mutuma Matthew, characterizing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrent and equilibrium forces in public life.
“Preventions of policies themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were also the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted for the abolition of the reductions appointed by the National Wage Commission and for the restoration of their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings per month not taxed, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will be created in the utilities of the Crowns, the capital repairs of the house.
According to the most closest calculations for the standard two-room apartment from the new year, 100 to 400 roubles per month will have to be added.
The Government of the region will determine the exact norm.
But when we paint the drive, make the staircase cells or even replace the elevator, the residents themselves will decide.
This law has been approved by the provincial deputies.
Vladimir Kennikov, President of the Vorones Provincial Duma, noted: “In this case, it is also necessary to set up orders to set up the orders for the ceremont of houses, to accumulate funds not in the managers ' companies - which we often have to register that in Moscow, then in Orenburg, somewhere else, that would be government control over the spending of funds that the residents collect for the repair of multi-family houses.”
Under the control of the State, the construction of the fees is now under the control of the State.
The law protecting fraud has been approved by deliberately reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4.5,000 people were affected by dishonest developers.
Most of the problems have been resolved.
By the way, the new law lays down rights and obligations for all participants in the overall construction.
Vladimir Kennikov, President of the Vorones Provincial Duma, stated: “It is not a secret that abuses in this area have also begun because in the 98th year of the year, the same spoilers have been hit, and in the 2000s, the same lots of people.”
People started to earn money to cover up the loophole, including the adoption of these two laws.
Under Voronese, it is decided to establish a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals subject to deportation.
The provincial Parliament has passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problem of illegal migrants in the region is to be eliminated.
Thus, in the past year, there were just over 100,000 foreigners on migration counting.
But only 1 in 5 has officially issued a work permit.
Where the rest work and whether they pay taxes are a big question.
Vladimir Kennikov, president of the Voronez District Duma, said, "They have violated legislation but are not criminals."
There are no courts, and deportation is to be kept somewhere.
Such a decision had been made by the Federation that regional funds had made such facilities available.
In the Voronez region, this place is defined as Old Olshana Semiluk district.
After all, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to a large number of parents.
First, families with 5 and more children are completely exempt from transport taxes.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million — but the same is the result of the savings of many child parents.
Secondly, and most importantly, those who adopt the 3rd and more children will grant housing subsidies from the new year.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people, is father, mother, family and 3 are adopted.
For them, the State has acquired 108 square metres of housing for 3 million,300,000 roubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microwave is an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage in the garden center for that amount.
Baumgartner is nominated to the Uralkalia Board of Directors.
The current Council of Directors of the OAO “Uralcalium” proposed a candidacy of the detainee arrested at Minsk by the Director of Vladislav Baumgertner to the new board, reported on the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner was listed in the list of 11 persons nominated to the new board of directors.
The list was prepared for an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, in which a new composition of the Board of Directors would be determined by a vote.
Baumgartner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
At his detention in August this year, he was charged with abuse of official authority.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, stated at a press conference that the charges of Baumgertner were reclassified to “abduction”.
Matt Dalton's doctor, oil chemistry, refused to comment on Vladimir Krickunov's withdrawal from the lower-ranking mentors' post.
Holkiper believes that Dmitry Balmin, the Acting Principal Principal Principal Coach, has great authority among players and will meet his responsibilities.
Remember, today the Petrochemist resigned Krykunov.
Honestly, I wouldn't like to comment on Vladimir Krikunov's dismissal, quoting Dalton RIA News.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will meet his obligations -- I have no doubt about it.
He has great authority on the team, and this young specialist will definitely look forward to a great future.
Leonardo Bonuchci, Juventus Defense, will not help the team at the nearest Italian championship match with the Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coach headquarters decided not to include it in the application for a game to guard against the 4th tour group round of the League of Champions with Real.
Neither will they join the Parma Lichtsteiner, Vujnić and Pepe.
And Fabio Kvalarella's forward was reinstated after the injury and ready to play.
Fuel travel will result in tax manoeuvres, which would include an increase in mining tax (FNI) on oil, while lowering export duties and increasing excises.
In the view of experts, these measures could bring additional 619.3 billion roubles into the budget.

U.S. Secretary: Skills sometimes "too far" in data collection
The U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, acknowledged that in the collection of data and auditions, U.S. special services were sometimes “too far”, but the policy clerk noted that the media's information on the audition of 70 million people was not valid.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was unjust.
I recognize this, as the President also recognizes... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future," quotes the Secretary-General of the AFP.
Italian employees and their seniors have made their way to young people.
Italian unemployment hits the record.
Data published on the environment showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population was unemployed.
This has not been the case since World War II.
This figure is more than a few times higher among young people.
40.4% of the population aged 15-24 have no employment.
According to the Italian authorities, one solution to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This exercise is already the largest energy company in the country, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the pre-emergency pension for workers with seniority.
On the other hand, Italy waits for the common problem of the ageing population for Europe.
And the economists are not sure that the premature rotation of staff will be justified.
What will result in the construction of the TPS in Moscow?
With each year, the capital authorities are promising an increasing number of trans-shipment hubs.
By 2020, 255 TPUs are planned to be installed.
What the project really is, our correspondent was working on.
A few months ago, a construction fence arose at the Smolenska subway.
The label stated that the transport hub was being mounted.
It was all very strange because there's no ground transportation coming near Smolenski, so you can't move on it.
To reach the nearest trolleybus stop on the Sad ring, it is necessary to cross some 130 m, including the ground crossing through the Carmanic Round.
It's almost over with Smolenski.
Disappeared the flower lare, dismantled the newspaper stand, and the asphalt changed in front of the entrance.
That's the whole transport knot.
Transport and transport hubs are flat and capital, explaining in the press office of the capital department of transport.
There's no capital tutorials yet.
The flats include parking, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that hinder passenger movement, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
In fact, TPS are not even employed by transporters but by professional mining workers from the capital city of Moscow.
The transport knot is not necessarily a complex design, explains Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute for Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economy.
Sometimes there is enough roofs over the head and a platoon for the arrival of transport.
For example, the subway of Yasenevo has recently opened a completely flat-sized transplant knot.
Let's have no hangings, but with the intercepting parking lots and the plaque indicating when the bus arrives.
But in the race for the number of officials, they're recording everything they're not hitting.
As early as 2011, the Mayor planned to build all 151 knots, of which 59 were capitalized.
Currently, there are up to 255 TTPs in plans until 2020.
One and a half of them are promised to surrender this year.
Although the city has a TPN development programme, no qualitative criteria have been identified, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization City and Transport.
Reported by number of objects, but the quality of transplant on each of them was often deteriorating.
In the expert ' s view, there should be two criteria: first, a reduction in transplant time, secondly, a convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the mode of transport without raining.
In Moscow, however, the TPS sometimes runs exactly the opposite.
Brilliant example of the UDNH subway.
Previously, the suburban buses from the Yaroslav highway came into the square before the main entrance to the WHC.
Their stops were now moved to the opposite side of Jaroslavka on the street of Cosmonauts.
Farther away from the subway, far away from the monastery, it's closer to the living houses.
The residents were completely unwilling to use the automobile under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
The capital TCUs in Moscow didn't start at once.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Planner subway.
The project was intended to be exemplary.
And there's really a sample of how the transplant node, which is paid to investors, turns into a banal trade centre.
No, there's bus gears, a burrow to keep the subway under the rain, and three floors of the parking lots.
True, the chemkin trolleybuses Nos. 202 and No. 203 in Moscow had no place in principle.
As strangers, they were moved away from the subway.
But there's more room to trade.
It's just 32 shops, and there's almost everything from zoos to cars.
Well, really, then, who of the bus passengers would need to buy a new car on the road?
We're always getting a shopping center when we're building a capital tutorial.
Recently, the situation had reached a logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot had decided to market.
Now, on the third floor of the Planner TPC, there is a brawling trade among the floor-marked parking sites.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speeches and guards looking maliciously at our photographer.
The transplant has finally turned into a market.
The point is, the Planerna subway had a market before, but it was dropped.
In the prefecture of the merchants, they were pitied and put on the crossing parking of the transplant.
Nonetheless, because of high prices, it is always empty.
The ridiculous thing was that the market was dropped to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's a rocket.
The Kaluja subway had a distance of 50 meters from the subway to the bus, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the trade centre, allegedly TPS, the distance increased to 170 metres.
To get to the bus, you have to go through the whole shopping center.
After 22 hours when it's closed, you have to walk it under the open sky.
On the other hand, the designs on the Planerna and the Kalujaska will soon show up with flowers.
In mid-September, the City and Land Commission of the Mayor approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPSs.
Four of them will be 25-story without counting two or three underground tires.
The main monster will grow up at the Tushino subway, with 418,7,000 square metres of area.
Representatives of the RDC railway stations who are responsible for the construction of TPOs in the subway have already told journalists: shops, hotels and apartments will be distributed in future multi-stage.
At the same time, officials are assured that multi-fertilized parking takes about one third to one half of the area.
Take, for example, "natural" garages.
Let's say the garage, 258 cars, which have recently been built on the International Street, has an area of 1,815 square metres.
So, for parking on 2.6,000 cars at Petrovsco-Russka, it's going to take about 80,000 quadrants.
It's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to every bus fare.
There are at least 150,000 square metres of commercial property.
And this is about two GUMs for a minute.
If the capital TPS are built by railway stations and stations, the rest of the sites will be covered by the Metropolitan.
They also promised that there would be a lot of "functional-purpose" objects, including hotels, offices and even sports rooms.
In fact, in the Moscow City Department of Equipment, journalists have recently been informed that they are drafting a decree that investors will be able to apply directly to officials to obtain a TPM site.
No competition.
Because, um, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPC is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Landing in Toronto, is sure Alexander Morozov.
There, trolleybuses and trams are descending to subway level, and the distance from the subway to the tramwa is only 50 metres without going to the street.
There's no over-trafficking around.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we're not building anything, or we're already hitting 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser suggests that the insult of patriotic feelings be compared to extremism
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against provocations and insults directed against Russia, the Justice Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish for this for five years in prison.
According to the newspaper “Envestia”, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the Duma Committee on Energy, Oleg Micheev, have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government to obtain an opinion.
Under the patriotic sentiments of the citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person with a country whose citizen is characterized by love for that country, responsibility for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Micheiev, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of formal signs of State authority, flag and herb.
In this regard, the parliamentarian believes that the protection of Russians whose feelings may be stricken and insulted by State symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country is not sufficient in Russian legislation.
As an example, he sets out the annual debate on the Day of Victory, where some media professionals allow themselves to question the heroic movement of the USSR people in the fight against fascists.
On the eve of the main nationwide celebration, the Day of Victory of 9 May, there is a real vahanalium annually.
In an astronomical and "alternative view" on history, some writers have come to reason that it is a pity that the German cultures have not won the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this to be absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual fortress” nation, and Oleg Micheev is indignant.
Furthermore, according to Micheev, the patriotic people in Russia are far more than religious, but the law punishes the insult of believers and insults the patriotic feelings.
In the opinion of the people's voter, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to impose appropriate penalties in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The Act penalizes insults of patriotic feelings, ranging from a 100-thousands-to-five-year fine.
The magnetud 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the Kokimbo area in central Chile, transmits the Reuters Agency.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a distance of 10.7 kilometres and 54 kilometres south-west of the city, as specified on the U.S. Geological Service Web site (USGS).
Points were recorded at 20.03 local time (3:03 1 November on Moscow).
Victims or underground destruction have not yet been reported.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic areas of the earth, so earthquakes are not rare.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the earthquake of the magnetud 8.8 and the tsunami that it caused resulted in the death of over 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in the recent history of Chile was recorded in 1960 with a record of 9.5 magnetus.
That disaster killed more than 5,000 people.
Dr. Medvedev: The Greenpeace case will be dealt with fairly.
The Prime Minister of the RF Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the Greenpeace activists would be dealt with strictly in accordance with Russian law.
France can be sure that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, and we have heard all concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance," stated Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with the French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detainees, Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisani, like the other activists, is charged with bullying.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detained citizen," quotes Mr. Ero, "RIA Newsty".
“Our country cannot support activities that may cause environmental damage, no one has the right to violate laws”, said Dmitry Medvedev.
He said that the activities of any structure that attempted to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including mining of energy, were dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “as a powder barrel,” and recalled what had happened in the Gulf of Mexico, transmitting the RIA Newsty.
The United Nations declares new goals for overcoming poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin working on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in moving the MDGs to replace the MDGs, which expired in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio on the day of the night before.
They were included in the outcome document signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said to the summits on the eve of the evening that it was time to “stand above national interests”.
“I am glad that UN member countries have agreed to launch and supervise the process of establishing the universal goals of sustainable development, the CSD,” he said.
These CSDs will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the post-2015 concept of development.
I will make every effort to take advantage of the powers conferred upon me by Member States to translate our vision of sustainable development, which builds on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing due to the conflict of powerful people
Looking above the statues of Samaria Mashel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the middle of Maputo to scan slogans for peace on one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed the business suit to the T-shirt that was decorated with the "We Require Security" label in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital area of independence.
During two weeks, almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo have been among the most violent encounters since the truce was over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known as the rebel movement, which was supported by the first white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa of the Apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to relapse into a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have forced foreign investors and local residents to become disturbed.
The high rates for the fast-growing economy, since the discovery of huge shelf reserves of gas and coal deposits in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion as investments for the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarco from the United States.
The ruling party of Frelimo, the lead political force since 1975, and the Renamo party have accused each other of the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the Government has been the initiator of the recent clashes by attacking its members in the Province of Sofala, the traditional wall of Renamo, on 17 October.
Attacks against former rebels were then exacerbated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dkhlakamu, the leader of the group, reported to the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, the representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renamo for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Hebuz tried to dispel fears of instability.
Hebuza stated to the French Information Agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dkhlakama felt “unsuccessful” and that he wanted to use “everything left of his strength to try to prove that he could impose on the Government his own decisions”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased after the report that Mazanga had declared refusal of Renamo ' s 1992 peace agreement.
He informed Financial Times that he had in mind the non-compliance with the Frelimo Party agreement.
“Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness,” said Mazang.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to alleviate the tensions that the series of clashes this year has increased.
“It is two powerful people (Gabusa and Dhlakama) who encountered the foreheads,” said Joseph Hunlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are a good negotiator and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo Party, which seeks to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weaker movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the Government.
The Renamo vote has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Mozambican Democratic Movement (MDM), which is based on the former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in those elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Ghebuza, who had to leave office next year, when his second term was over, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency,” said Mazang.
It was not clear what the Renamo was able to do, but it had already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the collisions took place in Sofala Province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but includes Beiru, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coals.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railways for about a week after Renamo threatened with an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was erroneous when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo Party wanted “to warn the international community that the cases in Mozambique were not going well,” said Mazang.
Failure has increased the Government ' s displeasure, and many are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent abductions, says Fernando Lima, head of the Independent Mediacoop Media.
“People believe that the Government and President are responsible for the future of the country, who must find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares for Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to renew peace, they want free access to the roads, ” he said.
The Arth Meinstrim Premier Series will be held in Moscow.
An Arth Meinstrim series of films, where viewers can see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they enter the Procate, will be held at the Rolan cinema from 1 to 5 November, reports the News RIA with a reference to the project organizers.
Opens an Arth-Instrima programme by the French director and actress Reim Kerici "Paris at Any Price".
This is a story of the Mai (as Kerichi) model working in the French capital, which is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film Kerichi, the audience will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duk, Mebius, the melodramatic bayopic of Oliver Hirschbiguel, Diana: The History of Love (Diana), with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Kannian Film Festival, Abdelatif Kesish.
The only Russian participant in the Arth Meinstrema will win the Kinotaur film of Alexander Veldensky Geographic Globes on the basis of Alexei Ivanov's single novel.
The main role, Victor Serkin's promising teacher, was Constantine Habenski, whose work was also marked by the Kiniotavra prize.
Children must study myths and legends as “models of life,” says the author.
The Torah's stories could show that “the crushing force cannot defeat the delicate craftyness”, and the legends of King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
Speaking that many myths would be “slowly wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach in schools”, Krossley Holland advocates the “hard selection” of suitable texts by age.
“I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklors are already part of education,” he said.
I advocated their introduction to the twenty-year curriculum.
He added that the “excessive moralism” of the authors and teachers was “interesting” for children, while the main ideas were “disablished” in fascinating stories.
Krossley-Holland, who translated Beowlf from Anglo-Saxon, as well as wrote the Norwegian Myth Collection for Penguin and the British People's Falls, said, “You may have intentions, but you would rather keep them with you.”
Perhaps a great difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or brought to a happy end, but that it is necessary to have an innate understanding of good and bad.
This must be sublimized; it is revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: Show, not tell.
A soccer fan who broke the window in the station waiting room is detained in Voroneska.
At 9:00 p.m. on 29 October, two soccer fans, the Moscow area, were removed from the passenger train by the Grazi Voronezi police station.
On their way to the favorite team, the boys took a drunken train.
Young people were brought to the police station on duty at the Grazi station to prepare an administrative offence report.
There, fans repented of their antisocial behavior.
The police have issued administrative material and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and waited for the station to arrive at the station.
At midnight, fans left the railway station in the morning, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and smashed the window of the front door in the station's waiting room with his foot.
A transport police officer and CPC security officer were hit by a broken glass.
They were able to detain a wrongdoer trying to escape from the scene.
The Ministry of Internal Oversight Services is inspected by the South-Eastern Ministry of Internal Oversight Services.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was being addressed, and the senior referendum for the provision of information and public relations from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on the transport of Sergei Olhovik had reported.
Vitaly Mutoko: Water ?
I think we're back 15 years ago.
The Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutoko, expressed his view of riots on the rostrum during the Russian Shinnik Cup match, Spartacus.
I'm an advocate for all of this to be responsible for sports organizers: clubs, leagues, RFCs.
But we can see they've taken a screwing position.
They're waiting for someone to come and make order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
The clubs should be able to organize hospitals, and the clubs should invite their stewards instead of letting things go on their own.
We have now drafted a special government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
After it's accepted, we're going to take a close look at this problem.
But I'm still going to invite all the soccer organizers.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, um, let's get the law quicker.
It feels like the Bawari hospitals came to Yaroslavl and they all set it up.
We're outside observers.
It's awful to see the rods hunting from a firefight.
And it's in a country that's preparing for the world championship.
"I feel like we're back 10 or 15 years ago," said Mutko.
Snowen can be interrogated in Russia
The ex-worker of the U.S. special services, Edward Snowen, is likely not to leave Russia to testify on the German Chancellor's telephone talks by Angels Mercel.
As stated by Interfaxu on Friday by a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from the German Genocourist ' s representatives in writing or by sight in Russia.
Edward Snowen's exit outside Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by US alliances," said the agency interviewer.
“In principle, the FWG's Genocuracy could send its representatives to the FRF or refer written questions to Snowden,” added the source, adding that the issue should be dealt with at the inter-State level.
Previously, the German Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebel reported that Edward Snowen was ready to testify on the German Chancellor's case of the U.S. Speaking Services.
Snoudden is ready to testify to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in the territory of Germany.
The CIA's ex-worker made it clear that he knew a lot of things.
Although the U.S. NSA blocked all its movements, Snowen is ready to come to Germany.
To that end, however, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival,” reported the Euronews Telecommunication Strebel.
Counsel of Snowen Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement by the source of Interfax, stated that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how it would be decided by itself.
U.S. Citizen Edward Snowen, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (ANB) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information on United States internet surveillance operations.
Snoudden flew through Moscow transit, but he was unable to leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the U.S. authorities in charge of serious charges, and remained in the Shiremetjevo transit zone before August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document providing him with temporary asylum in Russian territory for a year and left Sheremethevo on the same day.
The American attorney Anatoly Kucheren said yesterday that his client had set up for work in a "great Russian company".
The NSA tracking Angela Mercel last week was reported by German media.
According to journalists, the Chancellor’s telephone talks were heard by Americans as early as 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after publishing these information, stated that surveillance for Mercell violated German laws and sovereignty.
The Ponomers left the Just Russia.
The State Duma deputy from the Justice Russia party, a member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilja Ponomarev, filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
As the parliamentarian stated, he made a statement to the New Siberian Regional Party.
According to its statute, this automatically means that Ponomares have left the ranks of “justspouses”.
We're sitting, drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the painting "Illa Ponomarov puts on the table the bloclett," but it's not that epochy," commented the deputy of his decision.
Ponomares noted that they maintained good relations with the Regional Office of the Esthers.
In the meantime, Ilja Ponomarov has no intention of relinquishing the mandate of the Deputy of the Lord.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the faction and could not leave it by law.
Reports of the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the “Justified Russia” party came on 30 October.
It was reported that Dmitry Goodkov and Valerie Zubov would come out with him, but the latter soon refuted this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese Mida Fumio Kisida met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“After frank exchanges of views on the further development of the political dialogue, discussion of the peace treaty”, said the Kisid meeting.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Prime Minister Sinzo Abe of Japan visited Russia, relations between countries had become warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the RF would meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Newsty.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of disputed North Territories.
In this regard, Tokyo is now hosting protests demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
On the Japanese capital, cars are driven by the loudspeaker, "Take back the northern territories!".
The police are not stopping the protesters; they are watching to ensure that noise is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Commodity Festival: New Yorker
You can say boldly that New York is the place of the bandap comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, an audible artist Frank Fae, who worked a conference at the Palace Theatre theatre theatre in Broadway, began to tell the jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Fey's innovation over time has been captured by others, very recently, the New York Comicist festival.
Caroline Hursh, founder of the Carolins Club Standap, celebrates his tenth anniversary this year, with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these hedlineers started in Carolines, and then they succeeded, reached the level when they were too famous to speak at the club, ” said Horsch.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes presentations by Vanda Saix, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the Standap for heroes, an annual musical and commercial charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springstin, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Kosby will appear.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedies has expanded.
Several comicists participating in the festival this year have become popular in a non-traditional way, for example, through a show on small television channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known because of his role in a small-known cable cable series (in the FXX skeleton on Fentesi-futbola), and is now conducting his own cable show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Sleit entered the actorial composition, both in the Sabbath evening in direct air, and in the Parks and Rest Zone, although she is most well known for a series of viral rotas, Marsel - Bottles.
And Kroll and Sleit, like other young self-similar comedians (Surealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, a wicked one focused on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), are the result of a decentralized world of American comedy.
David Steinberg's interview with Larry David will be one of the most vivid points of the festival.
Steinberg started as a stendap-comic, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an informal historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the leading TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held at the City Hall Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of Larry's entire work, ” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he came here, he sometimes walks on a street between the two houses and thinks, "If I stay completely without money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities began negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported to the Embassy of that country in Britain, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawas Sharif, is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Vice-President Nick Kleg, with whom he discussed Pakistan and India ' s relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
“The Prime Minister reported that the dialogue with the Taliban had begun,” said the statement of the Pakistan Embassy in London.
- He said that he hoped and prayed that the dialogue would work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” added diplomats.
Pakistani Taliban (Techrik and Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the unnamed Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west of the country borders with Afghanistan.
Pakistani Taliban is seeking the creation of an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had attempted to begin negotiations with local talibs, but the movement had renounced the dialogue.
It stated that it would go to negotiations only if the authorities dispatched troops stationed in the areas of the Taliban and released the detainees of the Islam.
Navas Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, the British Prime Minister David Cameron, Head of the Pakistani Government and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell in price to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil has continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about large stocks have hampered the message showing that China's energy-intensive productive sector is gaining strength.
The U.S. petroleum reference class on the December shipment went by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel later on in the European time in electronic bidding on the New York Commerce Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract reached 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the October price of 5.8 per cent.
The rich oil stocks have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Ministry of Energy on Wednesday stated that US reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, the stockpiles were over 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, according to two reports of the Chinese industry that demonstrated its resurgence.
This indicates that China ' s economic recovery can continue to take effect after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after a 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
Petroleum Brent, a reference class of international oil, also used by United States oil-processing enterprises, went up 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel in the London Intercontinent Exchange.
The chief coach of "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goggler Simeon Warlamov from the first minute of the Friday match with "Dallas", expressed confidence that the recent night behind the crack had not shaken his confidence in the Russians had been handed over from Dallas sabotage of Natalia Schmelev.
What are we waiting for, said Rua after the morning fission of Lavin?
Of course, what all of us are worried about, but we are confident of it and feel that it will be useful for him to get out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show us his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure that the situation hasn't been affected by the maid's condition?
I'll see you tonight.
Our players will undoubtedly support Warley by helping him to protect the gate, as was the case in the previous matches of this season.
Most importantly, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court's case is resolved.
There's no need to be a vegan in Siberia: a warm tomato will not replace a soup.
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, correspondent RIA Newsty discovered.
People who completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
There they do not carry the winter without health loss, and no warm tomatoes are compensated, and New Siberian dietologists and doctors are considered to be interviewed prior to the Day of Vegan.
Drinking oil by litres
Strict vegetarianism, when not only the meat and the fish, but also the milk, the honey, the eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, such rigorous dietary standards are at least inappropriate for health.
Animal renunciation is harmful.
Animals contain indispensable amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate with vegetation.
You have to have to include in the diet at least milk or eggs," I'm sure dietologist Marina Gody.
It gives an example of fish containing indispensable fat Omega-3 acid.
Their richest plant oil is linen.
"In order to use it as a man's quantities, you have to drink litres!" says a dietologist.
Medicines are confident that the people of Siberia need to pay special attention to the diet in winter.
During this season, vegetarianism is particularly questioned.
In our realities, there are high demands for food.
You need more calories to stay free of freezing.
"If a person restricts himself by animal products, accordingly, that calorie he fails," says the expert.
That's what Olga Diethologist agrees with.
She adds that wet vegetables and fruits are not a way out.
It is better for a person to feed mainly on products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
Genetic code is designed to better absorb and digest these products.
And in the winter, people do not want to roar, but have a hot soup or something more.
She said that different grains, grains, beans, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries could be useful.
But that is certainly not enough for full food.
According to Claudia Arifulina, a gestroenterologist, the level of vitamins in the organisms is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our tough natural conditions, when the temperature can change to 30 degrees per day and the snow lies in May, is inappropriate.
The organism needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors point out that vegetation is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by maintaining vegetarianism, we give them inappropriate.
Pregnancy also requires increased protein, vitamins and microelement content in the menu.
"The guerrillas do not receive them," I am sure of God.
Arithulin says the adult is free to choose whatever he wants to play the toys he wants.
He's got a body already formed, a skeleton, organs.
And yet, children must eat fully.
If his parents deprive him of some micro-element or amino acid by choosing what he will eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"Sufficiency of any substance for brain development, vision, bones tomorrow will not be restored," she says.
All interviewed medical professionals agree on the low quality of winter-produced heat and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought and raised in the warms contains fewer micro-elements needed to us than (produced) in the open soil.
"The quality of food is wrong," says God.
Ariffulin also notes that imported and warm vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
At times, the desire of producers to produce more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples aren't brown in the slice, the cucumbers are quick to yellow and plunge, the tomatoes are inconsistent and near-matary," is an example of the doctor, adding that they are likely to be overfilled by the excess of fertilizers.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This is not in agreement with the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, a candidate for the rural sciences of Ver Petrouk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the standards and requirements of warming, full vegetables could be cultivated.
If they try to expel more than a square metre, they will, of course, become more frequent and feed plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow fast, they are large but watery and unsatisfactory," she explains, adding that the quality issue is primarily dependent on the producer's conscience.
The Court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “cessing and searching” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the execution of a judgement requiring modifications to the New York Police Department's programme and dismissed the judge from the case.
The US Second District Court of Appeal stated that the execution of Judge Shira Sheindlin ' s decisions would be suspended until the city ' s appeal was received.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution in the manner in which he had carried out the street detention and interrogation programme.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and the correction orders, including the requirement to appoint a supervisor to help the police office to change the practice and the related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the parties ' debate on a motion to suspend the case.
The Court of Appeal stated that it was necessary to dismiss the judge because it had violated the Code of Conduct of the U.S. Judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing prejudice, partly because of a series of interviews in the media and official statements containing a public response to the criticism of the court.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unwarrantedly referring to black and Latin Americans under the “call-and-seeking” programme.
It appointed an external supervisor to oversee the major changes, which include policy reforms, training and monitoring, and also decided to launch a pilot programme to test television cameras in police stations where most detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to discontinue the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after the police check.
The city ' s appeal debate should take place after 14 March 2014.
Tactics of “continue and search” were criticized by a number of civil rights lawyers.
The stop-track has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically in the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record in 2011 of 684,330 people, most of whom are black and Latin.
In 2004, four persons, all representatives of national minorities, filed a collective action.
The police department in New York said that these changes would put an end to unfair practices, form a more robust and effective police service and could affect the way other police departments implement this practice.
The opponents argue that changes will reduce the military spirit of police rather than crime, lead to unnecessary spending of money, and will not address the more global problem of complex police conditions owing to a few thousand reduction in the number of officers in the last decade.
The judge noted that she did not cease the practice of “clause-and-seeking”, which was consistent with the Constitution, but changed the way the New York police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Treyak Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is situated in the area of the Third Gallery and is located two kilometres from the subway station Novokznica to the Blood Square.
Street bags, flowers, benches, urns and toilets have been installed throughout the world, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Climentovsky and Lavrushini, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed for cars, the Ordine impasse, the Great and Small Tolmacews, the Kadashev Coast Area and the Bollocks.
Transport movement on the streets of Maroseik and Petrovka is not limited.
At a pedestrian area in the Pepnic Street from the Newsweek Station Lobby to the Climentary Crossing, the pedestrian conditions were created without de-moving and cutting the carriageway, transmitting newsmsk.com.
In the pedestrian area, there was a third’s gallery, a temple of the Clement of Pope’s Pope’s Clement, museums, libraries, monuments, and other spectacles.
Previously, the full pedestrians were the Tver Passage, the Stolics, and the Kuznetski Most Street.
The large Dmitrov, where the pedestrian zone opened early in September, it was decided to close the cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used a phone hacking to verify a confidential communication
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coleson allegedly used “a telephone hacking, tracking and resistance” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clark's novel, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The Prosecutor, King Andrew Edis, informed the Ald Bayley Court that in May 2005, the News of the World received an unreasonable news that Clark met with Hanna Polby's “interesting special adviser.”
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulkeir to hack Polby's voice mail and to warn her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages, heard the court.
“The accusation considers that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW,” he was not the man who would stand next to someone's house, hoping to find someone out, he's a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they're going to say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the News of the World had used three ways of investigating stories: phone breaking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about the tracking, he just needs to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone breaking?
He says, "No, we say, "Oh, yes!"
The messages of Clark's novel were the first to draw attention to News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Paulby said, "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
A voted cassette received from her phone at least three times was withdrawn from the Mulkaira house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were described as “Projects”.
During the period when she was under surveillance, her grandparents and her grandfather received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former Chief Reporter Neville Turnbek and former reporter James Wezerap monitored Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her a voice message on 18 June 2005, Coleson said: “I have a story that we are planning to publish tomorrow and which I would really like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that Coleson ' s participation in this history took place on the same scenario as other influential people, such as David Blankett, former Minister of the Interior.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blankett on a novel with a married woman while he had met Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny the conspiracy with other people to break telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkayr, Terlbek and Weserap confessed to breaking the phones.
Snowden expresses its readiness to communicate with the authorities of the FWG on the auditorium
CIA ex-worker Edward Snowen expresses his willingness to come to Germany as soon as he has an opportunity to do so, and meet with the authorities of the FRF, transmits the News to the RIA.
A letter from a former member of the CIA to the FWG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday introduced the representative of Bundestag Hans-Cristian Strebele, through which Snowen sent a message to the German authorities.
Strobel had met Snouden in Moscow on the day before.
Four people were affected by the fire on the Tver Street
Four passersby were affected by the combustion in a collector in the centre of Moscow, on the Tver Street.
According to Interfax with a reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, passersby during a fire in a suffocated underground passage suffered.
According to RIA Newsti, referring to the head of the capital Department of Fuel and Energy of Paul Livinsky, all homes in Tver Street are now fully equipped with electricity.
On the evening of 31 October, there was a fire in a heat collector near the house of 15 on the Tver Street.
Strong smoke came from the rain sewage hatches, and the subterranean transition near the Armenia store created a residue.
As a result of the ignition, 11 houses in Tver Street were destroyed.
In the 19:45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. USD cut food allowance for the poor
Nutrition allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday in the United States, the financial provision for products known as “foodstamps” has been reduced since the end of the relevant public programme.
The family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars a month less than the earlier.
This will affect 47 million poorest Americans.
According to the Reuter Agency, in fiscal year 2012, an average of $133 per person per month was one.
The cost of food aid in the United States has risen to $80 billion a year due to an increase in unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid provided by “foodstamps” that have been named since they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans in Congress require further reductions in the funds allocated to the programme, stating that it should aim at helping those who need it more than others.
Food shop owners across the Americas are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
The U.S. Congresses continue to argue as much as possible about reducing government funding.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platformer free of charge.
The Blizzard Studio released his Blackthorne platform on PC free of charge in 1994.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game is now available in Battle.net under the classic games Blizzard.
However, some geymers point out that only users whose shares are associated with the American service are currently able to download it.
The game is not yet available for Russian users.
According to the media, the version Blizzard now released on the PC is not different from the original game.
The soundtrek to Blackforne also remained unchanged.
Blackthorne's platformr, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came to SNES console.
His events took place on the planet of Toul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
On one occasion, the Dark Ruler, Sarlak, decided to kill the bright King Vloros and become the only ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vloros Kyle, whom they rescued from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later he returned to Toul to fight Sarlack's ambassadors and to protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne's publisher was Interplay.
There'll be new machines in Moscow.
But selling tickets to passengers will be not for money, but for meeting.
One trip of 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger of 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by means of modern technology, reports ITAR TASS with reference to the Olympic Committee press service of Russia.
The first equipment will be installed at the Exhibition station on 8 November 2013.
The new tickets will be presented by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Jokov, and the Olympic Gymnastics, Alexei Nemov and Helena Zamlodicov.
The recognition of the National Security Agency is strengthened by the paranoid of corporations with respect to State surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
In accordance with the instructions of the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), Germany's internal intelligence services, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. office building, which is less than 5 kilometres from the European Central Bank and Bundesbank.
The German media say that BfV was hoping to detect antennas of sub-hearing devices, which led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, again assured in September that the United States did not use external intelligence “to steal commercial secrets from foreign companies in the interest of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
But since Edward Snowen, a contract servant who has become a detector, has started publishing his U.S. secret secrets of exploration, European governments and company managers are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted in the word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has monitored the Brazilian Petrobras oil company and had access to data stored in the U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised the paranoia of corporations caused by State surveillance to new altitudes.
The last drop was the news that the chancellor Angela Mercel's phone had been listening for about ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can become a target, of course, the potential targets are also business leaders.
Cnoudden made it clear that extensive cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies was evident.
I think it is likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up, ” says Oliver Grunn, president of the BITMi association, representing Germany's small and medium-sized IT company.
German companies are convinced that the United States is currently at almost the same risk as China in industrial spying and data abduction, according to a study published by the EY Consulting Agency in July.
All the documents opened by Mr. Snowden have yet to show that the United States has transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some capacity in information technology and the Internet and felt that it should try to reduce its dependency on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option, ” says Gasso Platner, president of the German company software provider for the SAP business.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it was not worth letting it die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of U.S. spying agencies that have become known as Snouden’s revelations have been shocking to some companies that previously thought China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A great shift occurs in cloud technologies, where the leaders of European companies are better aware that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance Trade Association, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services of the U.S. cloud provider following the discovery of the American programme for intellectual data analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneib, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said: “We see consumers ask a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in that jurisdiction”.
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and consequently these data must be protected at any price.
What is happening in economic spying is not surprising.
He's always been there.
“It has been a matter of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the ongoing debate, ” says Kurt Bok, Chief Executive Director of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial levels, and we're spying them too, because it's within our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to boast about the response they have taken, as this can give the advantage to the opposer.
In large companies, it has long been learned that taking a free flash on the exhibition or leaving the laptop without a look at the hotel number is at least unwitting.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi Automobile Construction Company, says that for many years it has been a standard practice to collect mobile phones before meetings of government so that they cannot be used as listeners.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service of Germany recommends that companies managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently thrown out.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” warns BfV.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic spy from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report, in February, placed France with Russia and Israel in the second set of offenders who were engaged in hackerry for economic exploration after China, claims The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that, when it comes to the economic spy, “Frenchs are worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former leader of the French DCRI Intelligence Agency, reportedly stated in an interview this month: “The authorities are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died by “unlucky accident” believes their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia whose body was found inside a spindle sports mat in his high school sports hall believes that their son was killed, declared attorney of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Waldost State of Georgia, was found on January 11, in a vertically standing mata, folded back to the rostrum in his high school sports hall.
Investigators of the Loundes District Sheriff department concluded that Johnson had died on a tragic occasion, but the 17-year-old family contested this.
“They are absolutely sure their son was killed,” said Fox News.com Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kennet and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died as sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, physics laws and sound sense,” said Krump.
They think it's a cover for protecting the human or the people responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned in a bag for the corpses,” he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into the death of Johnson, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
Moore made a statement to the press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they go.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I believe that there is sufficient basis” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told the reporters that the primary autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of the positioning asfix.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Loundes District Sheriff office was not available for comment when he was contacted on Thursday.
South Georgia's judge ordered the authorities to publish on Wednesday all videotapes of the surveillance cameras that were examined by investigators.
The parents of a teenager said they were hoping that the video recordings contained the key to determining how he died.

Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools dealing with allergies among children
On Wednesday, centres for disease control and prevention published a list of recommendations for monitoring food allergies in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergies.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that food allergies among children have increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service staff about child food allergies and how to assist in the event of allergic reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep supplies of adrenaline — most commonly for injections — used by an automatic medical syringe EpiPen to help with potentially deadly anaphilanthropy.
State legislatures have recently amended their regulations to allow schools to make stockpiles of adrenaline with fewer difficulties.
The notification also contains a list of the typical symptoms described by children who have allergic reactions.
Children can say, "It feels like something tickles in my tongue," "that I have hair in my language," or "speaking chirpette."
Parents of intersex children can choose “undefined sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender among children born with external genital organs of an intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer be obliged to attribute male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call any gender of such children by allowing parents to indicate sex as “undefined” or “undetermined” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make hasty decisions to impose gender on newborns and to counter discrimination against intersexual people.
One intersexual man, according to BBC, said many years later, “I'm not a man or a woman.”
I'll stay with the doctors created with the bruises and scars.
Approximately one of the two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological substances that are diagnosed as “sexual deterioration” — a collection term for people with a typical chromosomes, honads (effects or seeds) or uncommonly developed external sex bodies.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersex.
Gender identification is still insufficiently explored, but most experts in the United States say that, if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to take advantage of all available information and to assign it than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if any.
The New York Psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification issues, said that the new German law would “make a good idea”.
Intersexual children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require prompt intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign the floor without surgery and then see how the person develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too precise.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It's like a mystery of why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people as distinct from transgender or transgender, as their condition is not gender but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typical of both at the same time or not.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sex, such as the muscle mass, the spread of the hair, the breast and the body complexity; primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general understanding of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crimes.
Boys with gender deficiencies now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or third sex in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian resident, Norry May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “disproportionate”, defending the right of the court to maintain “undefined” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, a third symbol will be used in German passports in addition to M and F to X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to the news release of France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French legislators, this strongly-expressed Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed dissent with the German law, stating that “in a situation where the world is getting into a new state where the sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning over two more pillars of civilization”.
One mother of a newborn child from Maryland also informed the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set up gender at birth.
“It is hard and easy to distribute the child, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child, ” she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital bodies were referred to as Hermaphrodites, a beautiful Greek god who had the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community viewed the gender as a leaf that could erase everything and then draw it again.
But now many challenge the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make a wrong choice without knowing how a child will view the gender as he grows.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an unrestrained psychiatric accident, ” said Drescher.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist; you called a surgeon.
Dominant theory of how to deal with children with intermediate genitals was suggested by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easy to change.
He introduced the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social, the way parents raise children, interact with the child ' s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a male or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy whose penis had been damaged during negligible circumcision, to cast the child completely, also removed his eggs, and to nurture him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of the transition, but that was not the case,” said Drescher.
When he was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors are still “using this model”.
But in the 1990s, when the Internet came, the survivors of these gender-changing operations declared themselves “unsatisfactory”.
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but with intermediate genitals.
The doctors were unable to determine precisely whether he had a large clinic or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never live a “full life” of a man.
Thus, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce’s external genital body and eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said to ABC News.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was assigned to vaginoplastics.
But while depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a sexual infringement that prevented his body from producing sufficient testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone’s shots and taking his chest away.
The operation made him unfruitful.
Today, he speaks in favour of others in an organization called Interface Project, trying to bring people to a standard of perception with intersex.
But Ann Temr-Mettis, executive director of the California Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “worries to navigate the labels and stigmas”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child “undefined sex,” she said.
We fear that he will contribute to interference.
We believe that it is better to assign a male or female gender and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Themer-Mettis said that her organization supported Australian law, since “it allows adults to make choices in favour of the third sex”.
“Agrowth people must be able to make their own decisions on formal sex,” she says.
The German law implies that it is awarded at birth.
It is a battle in which small children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baraz, a Pittsburgh mammoologist who has a daughter who has a sexually infringement and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law would “support” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baraz, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual infringement called “a syndrome of total indifference to anthrogens”.
Since her anorogic receptors are not working correctly, Kathy has developed female signs.
She's got a vagina, but there's no uterus and ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and has a child psychiatric order at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although unfruitful, she hopes to be a parent by adopting or by hestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own, ” said Barath.
It gives them time to do some analyses and to deal with the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “human” or “woman”.
In such a case, you are fine — to raise your child, to love your child.
You have a wonderful child, and you're happy.
We do not need to perform an irreversible operation hastily.
“This enables children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that parents drive because they don’t feel they're doing right, ” she said.
Eventually, the child will decide what sex is more comfortable with — and this is wonderful.
This enables children to make a decision on their own.
The boss of Chicago, Nikolai Habibulin, pointed out that he understands he has to play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two Habibulin Jastrebs first missed six Tampa Bay chabs and four from Ottawa, and in the second game it was replaced after the fourth skipped chaiba.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I couldn't, and CSNChicago brings the word Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, maybe we should approach them as games, and try to get a better outcome.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that you've had.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training, I feel pretty good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some snow comma.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The gateyards -- I don't think I'm alone -- always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not excited.
Whatever happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on my own so that I don't miss so much cheibs.
It's great that my colleagues support, but in principle it's easy: I have to play better.
Two games aren't the whole season, but I wanted to do them much better.
But it happened.
I have to put it away.
I'm just gonna try to play the next match better.
At Altai, the flight bus turned over.
A PAZ flight bus was revolving in the Rubsk region of the Altay region.

There were 12 passengers and drivers in the bus from Rubtsk in Wishnowk, everyone was injured in various degrees of gravity and hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to the City Hospital1 of Rubtsk, two hospitalized at the Rubtsk CRB.
Nedvedev expects the SSJ-100 aircraft to be deployed to Europe
Russia expects superjet 100 aircraft to be installed in Europe as soon as they are installed in the markets of Latin America and Asia.
“We hope that, in general, we will receive more than 170 copies of such aircraft,” quotes Interfax, the words of Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, to him at a press conference with the French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Airo.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as it was a joint project.
We have discussed some of the financial issues involved in insurance today, but we hope that once the aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and in Asia and the Pacific, it will also become our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be put in France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft constructed by the Sukhogo Civil Aermacchi aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The Lainer has been developed on the basis of modern technology and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The Dniepropetratives have launched a unique rescue program... the aists' nests.
In an old age, villagers placed a wheel on a high stake to lead to an aist court, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports are long no longer available, so the aists have admired the columns of the electrical transmission lines - interwoven branches are based on the wire, making the authentic house safe.
Grandmother Ana, whose home in the village of Ivanovca, Petrikov, had been living with a true family for the past 20 years, noticed the nest sitting in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants.
The birds put new branches on top, and the bottom layer is already sifting between the wires, it's about to collapse.
Of course, it's a pity for a family of arists who go to the courtyard each year, to send out and fed three or four birds in the summer, but they don't want to stay.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Grandmother Ania called the Kingdom Reserve, to whom the support belonged.
And I didn't even expect it to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still still in hold, said DTAC 'Dneprobenergo', Sergey Berezovsky.
In fact, corrosion began on wires that were already inside a nest weighing between 150 and 200 kilograms.
At any time, birds could be killed by electrical discharge.
And the local people were at risk of being lightless because of the damage to the wires.
Linear monters have therefore begun a nesting operation, which is not the first time that we've ever done.
Fornitologists from the Dniepropetros National University have helped to develop a nest transfer scheme.
They also conducted training for staff in the district networks.
A well - known denepropetros ornithologist, Alexander Ponomarenko, advised energymen at all stages of nesting reconstruction.
For the first time, it was calculated that more than 50 authentic apartments were located in the emergency situation.
Special metal platforms reminiscent of the crow were quarrelled for their reconstruction.
The base was spilled with the branches of Eve and then carried the old nest there.
According to the experts, it is sufficient to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to learn the nest and return to it.
Then they will build their own dwellings.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peachanka in Novomosk district.
A new iron-propelled pillar was set up near the electrical cord and placed on it a platform with an old nest already covered.
The whole operation cost nine thousand rubber energy.
On the other hand, the same village took place in the village of Ivanovka, Petrikov, on the outskirts of Ani’s grandmother.
Here the platform was locked in the previous place, only lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “home ” has been repaired.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four additional nests in the Dniepropetrovsk region of Po blood and the Queenschan.
By the way, while some rescue rare birds, others kill them ruthlessly.
On the day, the whole area was overflowing with the sad news, in the village of Ust Kamenka of the Apostolic Region, on the day of the opening of the hunting of pheasants, the poachers fired the lebrid family living on the local pond for fun.
The virtuous birds were not feared by the people, but the locals were feeding them and not hurting them.
When the villagers heard the shots, they fled to the pond, the four beautiful lenemen were already dead on the water.
Apostolic police officers now find out who shot birds in the Red Book.
"Russian Marsh" is becoming more popular.
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, the Russian Marshall will be held in Moscow.
According to the “Levada Centre” survey, support for the Russian Mars is increasing - 40 per cent of the citizens are in different degrees concurring with the idea of carrying out the march.
According to the Levada Centre, 40 per cent of the citizens endorse the Russian Mars to a different extent: 11 per cent of them are definitely positive and 29 per cent are “as soon as positive”.
The popularity of the Russian Mars is gradually increasing - in 2006, these shares welcomed only 14 per cent of Russians, and in December 2010, more than twice the number of citizens (28 per cent) supported such activities.
"Definitely negative" to "Russian Mars" is only 7% of Russians, "speed negative" - 19%.
Another 35 per cent were unable to formulate their attitude to this share.
This year the Mayor of Moscow agreed to the holding of the Russian Martial of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, which was reported today by the head of the Department of Security of the capital of Alexey Mayorov.
This nationalist action has been held every year on the Day of People ' s Unity since 2005.
On the question of the Sociologists, “Did you hear that the Russian Mars were being held in Russia on 4 November under the slogans of Russian rights in Russia?" Three quarters (75 percent) of the citizens replied negatively.
Only 1 in 5 Russian (20%) is now aware of this share.
Significantly, in December 2010, nearly one third of the citizens (31 per cent) were heard about the “Russian Mars”.
Remember that three years ago, on 11 December, a natural riot of nationalists was held on the Manese Square, which had escalated into massive riots.
The Levada-center also asked the Russians what celebration was celebrated on 4 November.
In two years, the number of those who knew the correct answer (the Day of People ' s Unity) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of the citizens attend this holiday.
Approximately the same (17 per cent) will be celebrated on 7 November by the October Revolution Day.
Most citizens (62 per cent) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
As Moscow's Mayor agreed the Russian Mars in Ljublino.
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to conduct the Russian Martial on 4 November in Ljublino.
This was reported by the leader of the Russians, the organizer of the Mars of Dmitry Demoskin.
In addition to a march in Ljublino on the Day of People's Unity, a meeting and a rock concert of the Colorat group will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
As the Russian March 2012
On the Day of People's Unity in 2012, the nationalists were marching from the Yakama Coast to the Central House of the artist, where the meeting was held.
The organizers evaluated the number of participants of 20,000, and the Ministry called the figure 6,000.
Communication: Obama ' s pre-election headquarters considered Baiden ' s deletion in favour of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the next advisers of President Barak Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 electoral list.
This discovery is the most vivid feature of all the expected book of Mark Galperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 Stocks: Game Changed 2012.
The Times has received a copy of a book prepared for the exit, and reported on Thursday night that the nearest assistants of the President conducted “master studies in focus groups and public opinion surveys at the end of 2011” to assess whether the Baiden exception could help to raise the diminishing hopes for the re-election of Obama.
According to the political surveyor The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt by high-ranking pre-election headquarters and White House officials, namely, the former head of the White House Administration of Bill Daley, to assess the impact of the election of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago Pre-electoral Headquarters and the Oval Cabinet.
Only six of the President ' s closest advisers, including Daley, the former head of Obama ' s election headquarters, Jim Messin, and former senior advisers of the White House, David Axelrod and David Pluff, were aware that the replacement was being considered.
The book “Stocks Doubled” claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their “blind personal relationships”, but eventually refused this step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the electoral list would not “better substantially the chances of Obama”.
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the Administration was really considering the possibility of replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I have been actively engaged in the consideration of many things, and this was one of them, ” said Daley.
You must remember that the President was in a terrible form at that time, so we thought, "O my God, what are we to do?"
Although Daley described the study as “necessary verification”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the electoral headquarters had invested enough in studying whether this step would lead to a vote.
“The pre-election headquarters do not spend such money on interviews and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” said Martin in the AC 360 programme.
It was not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of a replacement.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about the possible retapping.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President was “explored” for a possible replacement, the former head of administration acknowledged that, “possibly”, Obama knew.
Martin added that the “Stawki doubled” did not provide a clear answer to the question as to whether the results of political sensing had reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he took it seriously that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of deleting Baiden from the electoral list.
"Perhaps," answered Martin.
Would you like a ice cream shining in the dark?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first dark ice ice cream with a honeycomb.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop bright food.
He came to this idea by reading the scientific article on meduses, and convinced scientists in China to regenerate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream responds to the language of the one who eats it, increasing the pH level in the protein and making it light.
Chris says that as the ice cream begins to shine when it responds to the heat mouth, it means that the more you ski, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company, "Learn me, I'm good," says, "It's an incredible thing, but it's still at the earliest stage, if you're talking about production, so for £200 you'll get about 2 g of the substance."
The protein that we use in ice cream is reacting to your language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it's going to increase the pH level and the ice cream begins to shine.
We've tested it over the last few months, and it seemed perfectly to present it to Halloween, because it creates such a wonderful bright effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever done because the lumension of the medous is four times as expensive as gold.
So every balloon is worth about 140 £.
But it's pretty nice to taste.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, raw, beef, and taste of cheese gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This cannot be determined because of the breakdown caused by the ice crystals, which consist of ice ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do so.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of the honeycomb synthesized by Chinese scientists
Vladimir Chebaturkin, a trainer in Avangarda, speaking of his team for a regular CCW championship match, noted that the opacities had conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat of the Magnitogory Matallurg.
The expert stressed that Avangardu needs to be given more attention to the defence game.
We watched a video of a match against the Magnetogorian Metalurg, and we bring out the official Avangarda site of Chebaturkin's words.
- We missed a lot of cheibs, not a very nice moment.
They missed because of their mistakes because of the failure to perform the game task.
We knew the rival had a performer.
The statistics show that they had five attacks on the move -- three shots killed us.
It's a very good thing to do.
Have these mistakes been taken into account in preparing for today's game?
With the guys, we're really good at each match, we're talking after the game, we're getting ready for a new competition.
The main thing is to make the installation work.
Everybody saw the first period of the match against the Metallurg.
The game was done, and the score was 2:0.
They missed the head of the patch, and in the third period, they started to be wrong.
Given the difficulty of the game, I didn't see any sense in the connection of the defenders.
Defense must be done by the whole team.
Now, the Avangard has a long home series, the matches go in the day, and the team's got tired?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to carry out its moments and perform the game task.
Hokkey is an emotional game, if you're running the installation, it's not that hard.
Because of the new rules introduced by Russian Customs, hundreds of vans have been in line for almost a week on the border with Russia.
Today, Dutch officials promised to provide drinking water and biotualites
Hundreds of vans were found at the border points when they entered Russia.
This situation has arisen as a result of a change in Customs rules for the handling of goods.
The Ukrainian border guards and customsmen confirm that the turn creates a Russian side that has not warned in advance of innovation.
Since 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have taken additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, the Deputy Chief of East Customs, Vladimir Denisov, reported.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The passpoints are operated in an intensified manner.
FACTOV correspondent visited the border and communicated with the long-range fighters who were hostage to the situation.
The prices of the road cafeteria shop at the Novoazovsk checkpoint are growing every day, like the furus turn.
The trucks stand several rows, stretching about two kilometres.
The Customs Terminal of Novazovsk - Vévelo-Vissuka provides one of the major transport routes from south of Ukraine on the international highways.
From there, goods are sent to the Stavropolian edge of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday until midnight, these rules were still allowed, and the longitudinal officer, Alexei Headanov, who was carrying goods from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and had been spending almost a week in his car.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an extra package of documents and a payment of cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance to which it is transported.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5 thousand rubles (about 1100 to 1,100 roubles).
Those who go nearby, Georgia, Armenia, with a cargo value of up to $50,000, pay about 15,000 rubles (3,800 roubles) and pass.
And the others stuck -- no one has that big money with him!
Imagine, if the driver carries only $4,000 but still in Moscow, he needs 90,000 rubles (at least 23,000 roubles) to pay for transit!
The conditions for the survival of the border, no, no, no-no-billers, no-no-distances, escorted by their cars.
In border stores and cafes, it's always expensive, but prices like here, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers oriented and promptly accused them: 15 rings stand for the baton, seven griven cups of coffee, 25 grivin dishes of soup.
And the cafeteria is alone.
There's no toilet.
We're sleeping in the stairs, we're going to the toilet.
No washing, no baking...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife got ready for the road.
A week long, Victor Scotranko's other long-runner comforts himself.
Will my car get the line in a week?
Why do you have one and a half litre of water?
It's 11 and 15 rings.
What, a bottle of crystal, or water on silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take something for while there's something else, it's a seller's frozen.
After the media began to report on the plight of Ukrainian drivers, the authorities in the region were drawn to the attention.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novosa Garden Administrations has been entrusted to ensure that all who pass on the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, are provided by the Acting President, Donetska, of the Olgosсад Authority of Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance teams are on duty at the checkpoints.
Biotuales will also be installed for human convenience.
According to the official, the issue of progress will be resolved in the next days.
As reported by the Donetska Ollgosсад Administration, as at 31 October, 32 and 68 vehicles were prosperous at the international crossing points of Spenka and Novoazovsk, respectively.
“FACTS” will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in trying to slander the Lithuanian President.
Russia intends to implement information provocations against high-ranking Lithuanians and East Partnership countries - such a statement was made by the BNS Agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
This information is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular Moscow is going to “speak” to President Lithuania Dal Gribauskait of the Republic of Lithuania and to publish the falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarhiva concerning facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the Special Services, the Department of Public Administration Analysis of Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries is conducting the preparation of the information attack.
The structure is headed by Eugenius Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and participated in the assembly of the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A member of the operation is also allegedly a member of Department of W. Smirnov.
According to the Special Service, Smyrnov, under cover of the scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local policymakers, politicians and media representatives.
Smirnova is now forbidden to enter the country.
The President of Lithuania, Gribauskite, had said that he knew about the information he was preparing for it.
In her view, the primary reason for this is the successful presidency of Lithuania on the Council of the European Union and the “striving for the country's energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader had not previously unanimously criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She thus claimed that in the Kremlin, Lithuania was “not sufficiently respectful.”
In addition, Gribaoukaita accused head of the Vladimir Putin of putting “one only claims” to Lithuania.
Remember, in September Rossemorz suspended the import of the Lithuanian "mills" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products was not consistent with epidemiological standards.
The leader of Lithuania then stated that if Russia did not remove the ban, the Government should prepare a referral to WTO.
In the United States, a school director fired teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools of adolescents literally caused despair.
He said that the man had to take the gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, the young bullies were throwing a man's house with toilet paper.
As a result, the school principal opened a teenage shooting, which resulted in several wounds in the leg and a 15-year-old boy received his hand.
Since the gangsters were not owned by the Director, he was charged with an aggravated attack.
The man was released on bail at $125,000.
Notice that the shooting of civilians in the United States becomes a terrible pattern.
The man fired in the middle of Ridgecrest in California, U.S. state, just across the street.
The perpetrator then captured two casual passersby hostages, hid them in the car trunk and tried to escape.
Previously, a shooting was opened in Newtown primary school, Connecticut.
At school, Adam's mother worked as a teacher.
Shots in American school: wounded 14-year-old girl
A further shooting incident took place on 31 January at the American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were affected: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candys, not sleeping late, and make masks for our neighborhood.
Now I'm more like a scar.
I have not been called upon to distribute candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I'm probably not going to be there this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow with respect to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — namely, 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and will spend a total of $6.9 billion on canvas, suits and ornaments.
The only thing I've been waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion cost will be spent on suits.
This year, sexually unhealthy objects are at the top of the fashion.
Women are no longer required to be sex workers; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
With regard to men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the "Our Deads," and I'm sure that Daft Punk astronauts will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most common suits are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Perhaps there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We had our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, the Americans will spend $330 million this year on domestic animal suits.
That means a lot of ridiculous hot dogs.
When it comes to a confetetta, we don't make any difference.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about £600 million of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds, Twizler chewing monsters and Clark Bar's bats.
According to the U.S. Ministry of Commerce, this is a great news for 41 million children who require a confetus who have been prepared to subjugate our areas.
Moreover, we're going to buy and -- we're not going to lie -- we're going to eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don't want to use is maize kernels; yet, according to the National Conduit Association, nearly 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I still have to solve.
Nothing so expresses Halloween's essence as ghost houses.
They have fascinating names, such as “Awake behind the walls” (which, by the way, is in this prison), “War and Crying” and “The House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost homes in America that generate about $500 million of income, as well as the amazing pictures you almost described, which your friend put on Facebook, and you can't take away, and then the guy you like, sees this picture and leaves a comment like the class expression of your face.
And in conclusion, we'll talk about the tips.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Ticva when we were children, and the cutting of Jack's lamp is like a decoration of Christmas tree, what we've been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, the fashion of a child in a punch starts only last year with the Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumps.
Jack's lighter, slowly climbing out on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which grew £542 million this year.
If you want a more complicated job, visit Tim and Susan Matizon in Napa, California, and try to cut out some of their pumps weighing £2032.
The site of the Minoбороna of Estonia rehabilitated after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The Estonian Ministry of Defence website is rehabilitated after the morning cyberattacy, reports a press service from the department.
According to the Vice-Cancler of the Minoborna on information and administrative matters of Timar Petersop, it was a primitive attack, and the site just overloaded a lot of requests.
Our specialists have quickly set up, and the site has been restored to date.
"Damage to the Ministry is minimal," said Peterkop to the Postimees publication.
According to Peterkop, it's early to talk about who organized the attacks.
“We will certainly examine the causes of the incident and draw conclusions from it, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents,” he admitted.
In fact, on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine group made a response to the hacker attack on the Estonian Minoborna site and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO's servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need a NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia.
Ukraine should not be any slave.
We are in favour of Ukraine's independent.
“Rooks away from Ukraine”, says Anonymous.
Previously, the Minoбороna of Ukraine reported that the company of the Feodosian separate battalion of the Ukrainian marine infantry would participate in the command-based training of the NATO response forces Stadfast Jazz-2013.
Because of the unclean force, several schools and hospitals had to be closed.
Four schools in the South Matabelland Province of Zimbabwe had to be closed because the students were attacked... Goblins.
According to a local elder, the children were panicful, and it was not possible to continue their studies.
The Goblins story could be sounded as a child's bait for the European, but in Africa it was a very serious argument for the closure of school.
Adults also fear the unclean force.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe because hoblins were also attacked by medical personnel.
Issuance of the Land Rover racing series
There are racing seats and six-point belts, as well as internal communications.
Additionally, modernized brakes are available, a package of services providing access to mechanics of Bowler Works, logistical support and storage of a car between activities.
Drrew Bowler, director of the Bowler Motorsport company, said: “Ralley’s turns to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced racers, but people looking for worries, adventures and access to world class events.
We are pleased to propose such a course in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally Reid.
We have been very pleased to develop a Defender Challenge — a really exciting championship.
Defender Challenge also provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as for participation in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The Russian Forces are unaware of the Brat Cluster - New Slum.
This is written by ITERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the RF.
“After the media have reported that the Ministry of Finance of the United States of America has submitted Laps to the checklists on suspicion of membership in the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate 'Bracy', we have reviewed all the databases, but such a group has not been found,” said the agency interviewer.
In his view, the dissemination of this information facilitated the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian Mafia, which allegedly operated abroad.
As previously reported, the U.S. Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the Bracy.
Among them was the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
It's on the list as Grisha, put it on the day before.
They coincide with the popular Russian artist.
A definite name is Grigory Lepsevridze, a creative pseudonym, a place and a date of birth.
In addition to Leps, five others were mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a Uzbek citizen and another of the former USSR whose nationality is not specified.
In the United States, we are confident that Gregory Leps, who lives on Phuket Island, transported money for gangsters on their orders.
A photograph of the singer and all of his data that are in line with the validity of the communication are attached to the communication.
Moreover, Leps really just bought a house in Phuguette.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Human beings in the black lists of the United States Minfina are responsible for blocking their assets in the United States and for banning business contacts with people living in the United States.
Assistant Leps Maya Serikov stated that no notifications were received to the singer: “It is difficult to answer the question whether this is the Grigory, which is now spoken of in connection with the U.S. scandal.”
All that Leps knows is media information.
There were no personal notices to him, although I do not know whether they were in such cases.
"And of course, that's all, on the one hand, ridiculous, and on the other, surprisingly and unexpectedly," she said to Newsty.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuguette, but, according to the U.S. Minfin, he has a house on the Thai island.
She stated that Leps was now in a long tour of the Far East and Siberia and that the news had caught him during his flight to the city of evangelizers.
Fugitive in the Shinnik field
Some details on the character of the fan who escaped on the field during the game 1/16 final Russian Cup between the Yaroslav Shinnik and the Moscow Spartak.
As Arthur Grigorianz, the head of the CDC RFC said, with reference to the data from the IMD, the hospital is Moscow.
He's under arrest at the moment.
“In addition, Gregoryanz described how a fan had managed to break through the field:” It was discovered that the one we call him a viewer had come to an ambulance, escorting two audiences, referring to heart problems.
He came to an ambulance -- that's what the doctor confirmed for us.
Then he pushed the two escorts away and ran to the field.
He fled from the East and South Tribune corner to the East and North Tribune.
He ran through the whole field.
The stewards are responsible for this.
Prior to the entry into force of the Sport Act, this is a stewards zone - the police cannot intervene in what is on the field.
He ran to the rostrum, crossed the East Tribune.
At that time, riots began on the East Tribune and on the runways," said the KDC Head.
Remember that the decision of the KDC, Moscow Spartacus, will carry out the forthcoming meetings of the 15th tour of the Russian Championship v. Lockomotive and Zenita, as well as a fine of 600,000 roubles.
Fire teams were called to save the lost cheek that stuck 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous career stagnation.
Ruby's Coker-Spain fled after getting into a small accident.
Three days later, she was stuck in her career.
The fire came down on a rope on a heated slope to save the dog from the imminent death.
The puppy was fortunately saved after fire teams were summoned to raise it and to take it to a safe place after somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous staircase of a lean slope.
Rubie, a nine-month coker, fled after a car accident on a Sunday day and spent three days alone before she was rescued from a career on Wednesday.
Her husband, Scott Alderson, 25-year-old Scott, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Fleppet's career in the city of Dengolm in West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire firefighting service.
They were fiercely looking for their missing dog and posting treatments on social network sites after she fled to a career after a small accident.
Approximately at 14:15 on Wednesday, a steep dog guide observed Ruby stuck at a height of 50 feet at a career stagnation.
A technical rescue unit from the Klekhiton fire station hurried to the scene of the accident, descended down on the ropes to save Ruby, and used a gear to lift it up the slope.
A rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of a wedge slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move with her muscular while she was saved, she's completely strangled.
But now she's fine.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a rescue officer, said, "The rubies are very lucky that they saved her."
It was likely that she could get a very serious trauma or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for inspection, and it was found that she was fine, except for depletion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “It was scary to observe salvation.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
He said that if she was weakened and lost consciousness, she would probably fall.
The fires were great.
That was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Kitley added: “We were afraid that it might fall, but it remained there.”
The firemen were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger says he didn't play with Katie Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an Australian radio show interview this week, the pop star stated that she was a Baque Vocalist to Jagger's 2004 song Old habits die hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a Vetero, and she said, "He played with me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very good."
In a statement on Thursday, the representative of the seventieth-year-old Jagger said that he “was Catholicly denying that he had ever grieved for Katie Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps it confuses someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as visitors to the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new Prism album was debuted first this week.
George Kerevan: The breakthrough with Europe gives Scottish people a choice.
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to accede to the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for membership in the EU.
There's a time for passport control stories in Bervik and the barbed wire along Adrianov's shaft.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movements in the rest of Europe, although — which is predictable — this was not in the headlines.
Nor did no one point out that EU member countries were spending a lot of time turning their formal rules in a way that was convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen Zone, continued non-compliance will be a cheap assignment for Brussels in exchange for what he really wanted from Scottish people.
So it's not a worthless story.
And so old that it has become fascinating: for the first time, I heard a "pot" that "dependence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
Still, there's an interesting moment lost when you tell an old story.
Why should independent Scotland actually obey European orders?
Why change London’s yoke to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the big post-war plan to unite Europe finally stalled.
Europe is officially dead with Eurocrisis.
Throughout the European Union, parties against the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining force.
Even in Germany, the “Alternative for Germany” party, based only this year, emerged from nowhere and obtained nearly five million votes in September federal elections, thus, in fact, the “Free Democrats” (the “Liberal Democrats”) from Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to a federal European plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The rigid savings imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the trenches imposed on national economies through the preservation of a single currency, led many to the idea that Europe had gone too far.
The euro crisis was little due to the fact that national Governments were working with excessive budget deficits — it was only for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates benefiting German exporters — what German policies and want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, South Europe is in a preconditional disadvantage in production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currencies face a deeper problem of European productive capacities.
As a result of the green energy package introduced by Brussels, a cipher representing the subsidy of French and German energy companies by the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much as electricity and four times as gas in the United States.
It's a paralysingly unfavorable price environment, as we've seen in Grangmouth.
No freezing of salaries in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. language gas over the European oil-chemical industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, was a formerly strong EU supporter.
After the war, the French political elites viewed the EU as a way of controlling Germany and putting Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destructed economy of France in a plight.
The result was the right party against the EU, Marine Le Pen National Front, just won the decisive additional elections by putting the ruling socialist party in third place.
The Frente is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the votes, a timely warning to the British Liborists that it is not possible to assume that the division of the right will automatically affect the left-wing.
What makes Le Pen with his newly acquired popularity among the French white working class?
It would like to use the EU elections next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If, and this is very likely, the parties against the EU will be supported in these elections, such a cluster will be able to take up the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here's my view that the rapidly growing moods against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will come together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become a kind of vague “Europe (spoiled) nations” that General de Gollo liked.
Germany and several economies depending on it can save the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is moving away from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that Britain will remain unattended in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what situation does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of the Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within a more free European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other single-minded countries would be easier in non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, strangely, the most successful political movement in Europe against the rigid savings measures that have received an impressive majority in 2011 because of objections to the reductions proposed (and implemented) by the Leiborist Chancellor of the Treasury by Alyster Darling and the subsequent coalition of tory and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only in order to take measures of rigid savings imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Sexual Age: Ageing Before
Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that sexuality is near
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are guilty
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the early-generation mechanisms
The trend towards early sexual maturity is not the same for boys
A former correspondent from CNN Pat Eterij is a journalist specializing in child health and family matters.
Should mothers be frightened if her daughter begins to have breast - fertilizers and grow forehead hair at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, child endocrineologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time resting my parents, ” said Caplomitz.
Evident signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobbying and mirth hair and body smell, appear before girls.
But there was only a small shift in the age of Menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12.5 years and declined from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breasts begin to grow, at least two to three years before the Menarche, ” said Caplovicz, also author of the book Rainier Sexual Agreed for Girls: How to Copening the Prevalent Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how sexuality will progress.
Discussions are under way on what constitutes actual sexual maturity but are considered “previous” when the increase in breasts is accompanied by a sharp increase to 8 years of growth.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop, which is that a pediatrician can track closely.
More rapid progress can provide a basis for analysis by the endocrinologist to address serious problems such as tumors or bones.
There are procedures to deter early menstruation and to prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which may ultimately lead to slow growth and low adult growth.
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Caplovitz is careful with the drugs, but admits that “sexual development can mitigate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from peers”.
Another big problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even how they can deal with hygiene, ” said Caplovitz.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter had menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset because she was the first of her friends.
There are many declared theories about the causes of early sexual maturity.
Nonetheless, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are guilty.
Boys, like girls, have early sexual adolescence.
The Caplovitz claims that the assumption that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls between 6 and 9 years of age, which links fat to sexual maturity.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other conducive factors.
In that country, Afro-American and Latin American girls tend to reach sexual maturity before their white peers.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, early sexuality is likely to affect everything, from economic conditions and climate to genes.
It is still a mystery: while boys have hair on their face and on their foreheads at a younger age, the trend towards full early sexual maturity is not as high as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
Even infants and cocktail children are exposed to prize and lobby hair.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist at the Horiev Child Horeb Horestown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be embarrassed to receive instructions from the pediatrician on how to speak to their child.
“This may mean an earlier conversation than expected,” explained Caplomitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who flourish early need to be confirmed that even when this happens before, it is a normal part of life.
American Boeing Stalled in Chile is preparing for flight
An unplanned United States aircraft under the Open-Sky Treaty will leave the city ' s air harbour on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 in Moscow.
The airport administration allowed the flight of aboard with the money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the aircraft will fly away to Ulan Woode.
Other figures say he's going to go to the United States.
An aircraft in Ulan Ude was reported to land in the Zabaykal region because of the mist.
Because of unpaid accounts, he was not released from the Chile airport.
Thirty people, including the crew, were on board at the airport for two nights, reported by ITAR TASS.
As reported in the MID RF, under the terms of the Open-Sky Treaty, persons on board aerial vessel are not entitled to go outside the Chile airport, they can undergo border control at only two Russian airports in Cuban and Ulan Ude.
The Open-Sky Treaty was signed in 1992 and 34 States are involved.
Monitoring flights take place over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the promotion of transparency, the promotion of monitoring of arms control agreements, the enhancement of capacity to prevent crises and address crisis situations within OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do deceased celebrities earn, IK in the United States
The rating of living celebrities with the highest incomes in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But she was overwhelmed by deceased Michael Jackson, whose deceased income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Notable are the other celebrities who have lost their lives who worked a few times in the past year.
The second one on the list of the most “sustainable” celebrities produced by Forbes following the year was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the roster below, by Pineuts Charles Schulz, with 37 million.
Elizabeth Taylor, a leader (25 million), and Bob Marley (18 million), also entered the first five.
Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein were also listed.
In Moscow, the first beetle, Igoria Gulaev, opened.
On 23 October, the opening of the first flagship beetle, Igorja Gulayeva, in Moscow, took place.
The designer Igor Gulayev is known to the general public for his magnificent pieces of mechanical luxury.
And now they'll be able to evaluate even more fashion fans -- in Moscow, finally, the first beek opened up, why the designer and the dolce vita party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
So I'm especially glad I've got a shop in Moscow.
It's not just a office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
It was with such words that Igor cut a red tape and invited all those who wanted to... to illustrate the models that he looked at!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are in jeopardy of the width of the seat when large orders are on the horse
There was an intense dispute between the lead aircraft manufacturers about the width of the tourist-class seats on the long-range flights, giving the tone of an aggressive confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute is reversed around the width of the seats provided on long-range flights to the economy class whose interests are not always at the centre of the airlines, while the amount of space assigned to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of a sectoral standard that would include a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economic class salons, but its main American Boeing competitor says that this should be decided by the airline.
The controversy is taking place at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of more and more large versions of their two-month long-range aircraft and potential record orders are expected for 17-21 November.
The rear of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 are seated in a number, is central to the economic performance of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will contain 406 people, based on economic-class seats of over 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus says that its competing version A350 will be transported to an economic class of 350 people in 18 inches wide, 9 inches in a row.
Fixed-wing giants often exchange technical impacts through advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now directing the public to the Dubai air show, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
It has recently demonstrated how a new advertising war could start by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant clipped together, called “Would you agree to it?”
“Boeing offers far-ranging flights on seats narrower than the regional turbowint aircraft,” said the sales manager, John Lihi, of Airbus.
With a change in diet, people take weight, but plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Broadfluorin Boeing 747 set standards for modern travel, the average American man aged 40 to 49 had increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The average 21st-century American man ' s wagon covers 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats in the 1950s, when the average coverage of those recently referred to as “reactive public” has already been.
Airbus said that a study had ordered that an additional inch in the width of the seat would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests the airbus figures for seat sizes and says that manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines can balance tariffs and conveniences.
According to her studies, the convenience of the salon is not limited to the width of the seat.
“Everything really makes it possible for airlines to make choices and to do what they believe they should do in order to succeed,” said Boeing specialist at Kent Craver Salones.
They don't want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The issue for passengers is to increase space side by side, but for suppliers it is increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is followed by an airplane order race, estimated at least at $700 billion at catalytic prices in the coming decades, sufficient to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As reported in July for the first time by the Reuters agency, the location of seats is precisely what fuels rivalry in the battle between the latest jet aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in profitability to one place in their last two-month long-range models compared with the market leader in this segment, 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated Boeing characteristics are partly based on a comparison of 10 rows of 777X with the original 9-member series of constructive decision 777.
The gains are reduced at a given cost compared with the 10-meaning layout currently used.
“The reason for Boeing is to compress more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our development,” said Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus Comfort Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that 10-local salons for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a density that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The day of the eighteen inches would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, the airbus proposal is due to a threat from the 777th model,” said an interior specialist in Mary Kirby, founder and editor Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not deliver chairs, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world’s sellers of jet planes even carry rudders to verify competing plans.
All manufacturers also offer comfortable airlines with a very tight composite compartment for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10 rows, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, airbus stressed the need for additional salon modifications, offering wider access to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other producer of the major modern aircraft, the experts say that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly off”, but it can distract attention from the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine can deprive the process of smoking of pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive cigarette smoking of pleasure.
One dose of vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before the beginning of human tests, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Christall of Wayll Cornell's Medical College in New York stated that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to abandon all the methods available today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to provide genetic information for the production of antinicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infecting liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable antibodies flow.
The antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain to prevent nicotin’s striking.
vaccinated mice, which was subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And mice that weren't given the vaccine was relaxed, and it's a sign that nicotine came to their brains, says researchers,
These experiments are described in Science Translation Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the value of the new vaccine is probably going to be much lower because it turns liver cells into an antibodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was entirely safe, it could be given to children before they wanted to try a cigarette that prevented nicotine dependence.
More likely, though, it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them to get rid of this habit, ” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but they warned that further research was needed.
Oleinikov: one-third of the villages of Submoskovia fully subtracted
Vice Governor Yury Oleiniko stated that almost one third of the rural settlements in the Moscow region were completely subtaneous
A total of 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the region's budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
122 rural settlements ' income subsidies exceed 50 per cent and 83 per cent dotted.
Within the framework of the budget, some 25 billion roubles are being dispatched from the regional budget," said Oleiniko.
The Vice-Governmentor also noted that only three urban settlements - Wettsch, Single and Pushkino - have a budget income of over 1 billion roubles for 2013.
Rural settlement incomes in many areas are less than 3 million roubles, “this is not enough”.
The cost of maintaining a local administrative apparatus in 88 submoskvia settlements is over 70 per cent, “and there is a decrease in the quality of services”, noted Oleinikov.
It had previously commissioned the heads of municipalities of the Submoskya to consider, by the end of November, what settlements needed to be scaled up, merged into urban districts or changed the administrative system.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Until then, the Governor of the Moscow Region stated that the administrative reform in Submoskovier planned to reduce the number of substantiated rural settlements.
Also in Khayrski, the Solnikogorski, Kolomen districts, Ljuvertskas and Koteltels, there is a request for the expansion of municipalities.
This issue will be discussed in the cities and regions of the region in November.
President Igor Brinzalov of the Mossoduma Igor Brinzalov also stated that some 30 rural settlements in the 12 areas of Sub-Moskowia were planned to be combined within the framework of the forthcoming Admreform.
This is because of the less than one third of the 178 rural settlements in Pozmoskovier have a “appropriate” financial base and 100 dotted.
Diane Arbenina celebrated Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not conceal the great pleasure she receives from the upbringing of her children.
Although it is right now that Arbenina is especially time-consuming for creativity and public activities, she still finds the opportunity to ride with Martha and Artem, not only spending time on their education but also entertaining as she can.
During the last week, Diana twice reported to her worshipers about her pedagogical talents.
First she put in Facebook a picture that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday I fought the fans to show you how Artema and Martha were putting on Halloween.
The bat race is ready, our first halloween" -- so named Diana a photograph of her children dressed in the celebrities.
What's not wise is that they're, like no other Russian boys and girls, because they're born in America.
Germany is the first to introduce “undefined sex” in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to register children born to hermofrodites, instead of male or female, to indicate “undefined”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the “sex” in the birth certificate for time.
For “F” (woman) or “M” (human sex) parents may write “H” (undefined) for the time.
This decision aims not to encourage parents to rush into a gender "definition" operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world are born hermofrodite.
The Trinity denies Obeid's influence
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, will be a member of the State's anti-corruption oversight body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, challenges the change in the rental of the naval sites at the request of his political tutor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned the share of three real estate sites on public land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday to see whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers for extending the lease contract to Serkülar Ki, where the Obeid family belongs to two restaurants and cafés, without a tender following their expiration in August 2005.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid ' s secret participation in real estate facilities, following the testimony of Mr. Tripodi Linn Ashpoul, former Deputy Head of Administration, on Thursday.
During the several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that leases should be held for an open competition.
The renters objected to this and also wanted longer leases.
In 2009, lease contracts for Serkülar Ki, which brought the Obeid family about 2.5 million per year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who had been Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
However, he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as recognized by Mr. Tripodi, urged that the Government's rental policy be amended.
The ICAC telephone interviews were made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dann, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the question discussed during these telephone conversations a question of the development of commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wili, Mr. Tripodi.
“No, ” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely the wrong thing.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a high-level official, Israeli warplanes attack targets inside Syria
A senior management officer interviewed Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes had attacked the target in the Syrian port city of Latacia on Thursday night.
The governor did not specify what the purpose was, but said that it was at least one.
Associated Press reports that the purpose was to launch SA-125 rockets.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out aircraft cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign visa workers under subclass 457 may be tested for “validity”
The “factivity” test for foreign visa visas of Class 457 is under consideration by the Government, as it suggests an increase in repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of visas of Class 457 to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Laborist deputy Maxine McKew criticized the Government ' s rhetoric on foreign workers, saying that this could offend Australia ' s neighbours.
“Great declarations of the type “foreigners — at the end of the line” and “working for Australians” are a very unpleasant turnover to times when trade unions demanded a secure labour market,” she said to Australia - India Institute today.
Historically, it meant that it was the white work that had to be protected — and if some in the region saw the revocations of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The paper for discussion sets out 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he meets officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes and the others are under review.
If the criterion of “validity” is accepted, the applicant may be examined for “whether the candidature is genuine in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or a close friend of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also require to report by the number of visa holders in subclass 457, since the former businesses intended to sponsor a small number of employees were then recruited by hundreds.
In the meantime, 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seekers died of allegedly infarct after arrival on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of this man, who was killed with grief, was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he was supported by a cousin who was also on board a ship.
The Australian authorities hurriedly sent a man to the Christmas Hospital where he died.
A friend of Simeon Varlamova stated that Hokkeist suffers from alcoholism
A friend of hokkeist Simeon Varlamova Eugenia Vavrinyuk stated that he suffered from alcoholism, transmits the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” said a woman in particular.
Recall that Vavrinyuk brought to the court for being beaten by the galleyper of the Russian assembly, Simeon Varlamov, who is also a member of the Collorado Club.
She said that the hokkeist had pushed her over her hair and beat her hands, breast, stomach, and neck after the attack.
Varlamov himself came to Denver Police and confessed to be beaten in detail.
He was arrested, but later released on bail at 5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in country movements, but forbade the approach to Vavrinuk.
He also faces imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact of Scotland on the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project is to open a high-speed communication with Scotland and North England, with the beginning of the First Phase in 2026.
The Minister of Transport, Baroness Kramer, noted that the project would “unit Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said that he was “astounded” with the prospect of working on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Phase is completed, the lines will be located in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and North England from 32.7 billion to 42.6 billion dollars.
The British Government, which negotiated with Scotland Transport, requested HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and reduced travel time for North England and Scotland.
This should include an opportunity to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our objective is to establish a real national network that will make Britain and its cities closer to each other”.
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are enormous.
Without it, we will face the crisis of capacity in our railway network.
But this is also the transport of cities to each other; 18 cities throughout Britain, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better reported by HS2.
Scotland Secretary Alister Carmajkle added: “Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland”.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown called on Mr. Carmaikla to “equivalently” support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance of bringing enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general reasoning for high-speed railway across Britain”.
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of a high-speed railway in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the Glasgo Railway, Edinburgh, already planned by the Scotland Government.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British Ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Tory is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
Incineration of hydrocarbons (where they are) adversely affects climate.
Renewable sources of energy require large spaces for generation.
Atomic energy costs no more than that, but it leaves a lot of expensive waste management.
Recently, scientists have drawn attention to a rotor, another radioactive element of the Mendeliev system.
It occurs around the world and, according to experts, its fissile does not leave waste that must be kept for centuries.
Rules on the use of electronic devices on aerial vessels in Australia for the time being in force
Australian airline passengers will need to continue to dismantle their schedules and smartphones during air and landing, despite measures in the United States to mitigate the regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority has allowed American carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos, or play on their devices during the flight and landing, provided that they remain in the Flight Line.
Passengers are already able to do this during the main part of the flight, but many are irritated that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and landing.
Australian carriers were considering this decision, which required the United States airlines to do a great deal of work to meet new requirements, but indicated that they were not planning to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight were still in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority does not currently have special rules governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft”, it stated.
This issue is governed by the rules that require air carriers to maintain security at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety regulations that crew members report to them.
The company Virgin, which had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of the use of the Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, had not opposed the changes but had stated that it would follow the direction of the controller.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of the resolution of the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the batless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” said the Spokesman.
Qantas stated that it would adhere to the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during flight and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon,” she said.
The FAU regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in the regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly study the OPS ' decision and the reasons for it.
For US carriers, the effect of the regulation would vary from airline to airline and depend on the age of their air fleet.
The carriers will have to prove that their aircraft have a resilience to radio disturbance from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, manuals and passenger instructions.
“After the airline checks and confirms the disturbance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as planchets, electronic books and smartphones at any altitude,” said FAU.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off its devices during the landing.
In addition, according to the group ' s recommendation, the heavier devices shall be situated under seats or in the upper luggage compartments during the взлет and landing.
The head of Daghestan is heard in the hymn of Cubania by a note of extremism
The Football match between Angi and the Cuban was a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Daghestan after the painkillers burned the Dagestan flag, and the hymn Cubani sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipip, on Thursday, invited the Republican parliamentarians to appeal to the court because the hymn of the Redodar Land allegedly called for an international conflict, in particular calling for war against the “bassurmans”.
Take the hymn of the Krasnodar province, which is now being approved in 1995.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Then, remembering you as your mother, our enemy, the Basurmanin, we are going to kill us."
Putin achieved impunity for his friend Asada
Now the news is about the ocean, namely, from Syria, where, as we now know, Israel attacked Russian-producing missiles, reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important requirement of destroying its production of chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached by the Russian mediation and allowing the United States not to carry out a military operation to which they came in that summer.
More about the weapons and what this means for the Syrian President will tell our principal international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said Assad's regime would be punished for it.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed by poisoning gas in August.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal made by Asada's friend Vladimir Putin.
Syria will refuse its chemical weapons by the middle of the next year.
And today is a milestone.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had withdrawn the reported chemical production factories.
The longer-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand, it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say Asada's days were counted.
I think Asad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He's no longer a legitiman and he has to leave.
But Asad stays.
And it feels more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napols.
His opponents are disunited and ill-armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Asad has escaped the punishment for mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement was described as a success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Asaad himself made an impression of a person willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, D.C., the U.S. Ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is unlikely to be more easily killed by chemical weapons.
Asad is still holding.
And it changes the weapon to power.
The President of the RF has established a separate Ministry of Construction and the LCHC
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, set up a new Ministry of Construction and the FMC and proposed to lead his ex-Governor, Mikhailou, in the Ivan area, in the process of the personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Mechan at a New Ogarevo residence, and I did not refuse to head the new department.
The Spokesman for the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, explained that all construction and MCH functions are transferred to the new Ministry from the Minority.
Mikhail Man, the son of the famous Orthodox priest Alexander Me, graduated from the Moscow Petrochemical Institute of Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began -- he was elected to the Moscow District Duma of Serbia-Posada, the first Vice-President of the Government of Moscow, the Vice-President of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013 Mikhail Men was governor of the Ivanova region.
Lombard owners in Singapore are doing well while the middle class is having difficulties
Janani Amyrthalinga, at the Bandemir Trade Center in Singapore, is building a gold bracelet, ring and earring to pay for her daughter's schooling.
“My husband and I just bought the house, so all my money is invested there, ” says Ms. Amirthaling.
Although she earns S$3,000 a month as administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt is growing, is such that the ValueMax, where it deals, this week has become the third brokerage registered at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Loan on bail for jewellery is not just a quick way to get money (S$ 1,100 in the case of Mrs. Amirthaling), but is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, typically, the annual interest rate is 17 per cent more than 15.4 per cent proposed in the United overseas Bank office, a local creditor with an affiliate at the same trading centre.
However, lambards have the advantage that they do not require a check of creditworthiness or evidence of pay and can lend more quickly than banks.
For this reason, millions of people throughout the region are being targeted as families feel pressure due to the cost of living and the rapid increase in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the world financial crisis and low-cost loans supported by free monetary policies in developed economies, low-income and middle-income families are targeted in order to compensate for the decline in income as their economies slow down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's, rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the growth of the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest household debt ratio to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list from 80 per cent of GDP as compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continuing decline in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The fact is that with rising prices, people in the middle and bottom [income scales] will look for ways to fill their income wherever they can”, says Song Seng Won, a CIMB economist, of the Malaysian Bank.
Highly high gold prices over the past two years have increased the haste with which people lay their personal belongings because they use the opportunity to obtain money for their family ornaments.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items in 200 lombard cities are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold looks good, let's put in a golden chain of grandmothers and get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest EasyMoney Lombard operator observed an increase in the number of clients using its offices in recent months, up to 20 per cent.
The growth in the Lombard Business is such that the ValueMax, the Bendemir office operator and 15 others in Singapore are planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Ling, Executive Director ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 per cent of the S$66 million invested this week as a result of the stockpiling of Singapore.
While some creditors had caused criticism at high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that the lombard was not only offering cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also did not increase the debt directly.
“The clients lay the items they already owned and the coining of personal assets did not increase the debt of households,” she said.
The Fund has gained wider public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
At the same time, the lombards do not only benefit from the categories of people who are in a difficult financial position.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax branches to create gold or Rolex clocks that can give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value to cash.
We see clients from all sectors of society.
“These include wealthy persons who need to take money for short-term commercial projects or investments, or small business enterprises that need to overcome temporary financial difficulties,” said Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is important for the population, not for the number and status of available health facilities, but for the quality of medical care provided.
Implementation of the Tulse Health Modernization Programme for 2011-2013, the reorganization of our city ' s health institutions will help to create an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynaecological, pregnant and childbirth patients.
For example, after combining with the Hills, there was an even greater opportunity to attract the NHKS narrow professionals to consult pregnant women with different pathologies, and to conduct additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistical base of the maternity home has been significantly improved, and modern equipment has emerged in accordance with world standards.
During those years, approximately 8 million roubles have been allocated for major maintenance of premises, and 112 items of 42 million roubles have been purchased.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operation of the Caesarean section, the Sell Sever machine is used to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, to return its birth, avoid transfusions of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical lab diagnosis.
Electronic registers are in operation in the women ' s consultation, and the introduction of electronic maps and stories of patient illness is planned in the near future.
The development of telemedicine has enabled gynaecological, pregnant, childbirth and newborns to be consulted with provincial specialists.
Chechens beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechnya citizens were arrested by the French police on suspicion of a series of attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been conducted since March this year.
Approximately 60 women were complained about the acts of the Caucasus.
Gangs reportedly ordered prostitutes in one of the ostrich hotels and then beaten and robbed them.
The gang leader was 27 years old, formerly convicted Chechnya.
The Bawari Defense Defense David Alaba became the best athlete in Austria in 2013, reports the official Bundesliga site.
In this dispute, it has preceded winter sports, which are traditionally the best in the country.
Marcel Herscher took the second place, and the third was a skiing skier from Gregor Schlirenzauer.
In the last season, the 21-year-old Filipino-Nigeria Austrian assisted his team in winning the League of Championships, the German Championship and the Cup, as well as the Supercube of UEFA.
Arshavin's ex-wife rests with Andrey Chad's actor
The former civilian wife of the Pieter's Zenita, Andrey Arshavin Yulia Baranovska, carries out leave with Andrey Chadov.
Julia rests in Italy in an actress company of Anastasia Zaroute, her fiancée, the figure of Sergei Vladnova, and Andrea Chadov's actor.
Instagram Anastagram of the Anastasia of the West.
It's not the first joint photograph of Andrey and Julia.
On 5 October, the Satellite published a picture on which a couple should hug up on the Gulf of Finnish in Komarov.
In mid-October, the Habek Zenita, Andrey Arshavin, admitted that he lived separately from his civilian wife, Julia.
Remember, Julia Baranovska and Andrey Arshavin have been together since 2003 with three children.
It has recently been known that Arshavin meets with the ex-model Alisa Kazmina.
A new friend of Arshavin was married to a top manager of the corporation.
325 million rescue package for Tasmania health
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million rescue package for the weakened health system in Tasmania will be supplemented with strict conditions that guarantee that the State Government will not waste the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersse, announced that the Commonwealth was taking “immediate measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the higher level of chronic diseases and the system's limitations.
The decision to finance for four years was taken following the Government ' s consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilki.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will address the specific problems facing the State,” said Ms. Pliberssek today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for the Planned Transaction Bulletin.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic operations and cataract removal operations, will help to overcome the backlog.
Money is also available for hospitals that receive unregistered patients in Hobart and Lonseston to improve the quality of post-patient care, medical training, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical maps in local hospitals.
“These investments will follow the ideas expressed by the leading doctors on how best to help Tasmania's health system,” said Ms. Pliberssek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania would work in strict accountability and accountability.
The State would need to maintain current levels of funding in order to obtain the funds of the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where it was spending the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would be unresolved, “if there is no genuine reform that would put Tasmania's health system on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he had first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that a federal aid package will contribute significantly to the withdrawal of the state's health system from critical condition,” said Mr. Wilki.
According to the State Government, these additional sampling procedures are largely offset by recent reductions.
But the federal opposition representative of health care, Peter Dutton, believes that today's statement is a “decision similar to the leukoplaster”.
“The reason we are here is that the Leiborist Government of the State has removed $430 million from the health system,” he said to the ABC TV.
When the state government loses nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it is not to pretend to be good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersse to guarantee that no dollar of the rescue package would be spent on an additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Guillaume Nicklo of novel Danny Didro can be an exceptional design and historical detail, but it is also more difficult to perceive than it should have been.
A film in France in the 1760s relates the gloomy story of Susanna, a young aristocratic woman sent to the monastery of her family.
When she starts rebellious, she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the satanist and becomes the object of erotic fantasies to others.
The film never goes down or sensational — and that's the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the story risks being a test like the wool and the audience.
Syria destroyed its means of manufacture of chemical weapons, said the Monitoring Group
Syria destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisoning gas, declared on Thursday an international monitoring group, while violent clashes burst in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are supposed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian activist group stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
Statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization, to have Damascus destroyed or “incapable” all chemical weapons production and mechanisms to mix chemicals with poisoning gas and fill them with ammunition.
The conclusion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in the ambitious schedule, which aims to destroy all Damascus chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, is yet to begin destroying existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is expected to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nervous gas.
This statement was made during heavy fighting on Thursday in Safira, where experts believe that there is a chemical weapon production facility and its storage site, reports the Syrian Centre for Human Rights, based in Britain.
The activist group, which tracked the loss through the Syrian network of activists, stated on Thursday that 120,296 people had been killed.
Of that number, 61,067 were said to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,944 persons are members of President Bashar Asad ' s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-governmental militants and 187 Lebanese fighters of Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 Armenian fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 100,000 have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
The Asad War fought in Safire for several weeks with the rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that the victims on Thursday were on both sides, but did not provide specific data.
Boy stressed the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors by the time frame of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal in the wake of the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, states that its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and seen all Syrian critical means of production and equipment for mixing/filling”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Previously this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first verification round by visiting 21 of the 23 sites announced by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two seats for security reasons, stated by the inspectors.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that the two places had been, according to Syria, “the chemical weapons programme and... items in which it contained were moved to other reported sites which had been verified”.
It was not possible to find out immediately whether the site in Safire was one of the two places that OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and courage you all have shown in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzümjy, Chief of the Monitoring Group in the OPCW commentary.
For the third year, civil war has been confronted by rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Asad and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawit sect, the response of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of Rami Abdurrahman Centre said that there was a severe explosion in the environment at the air defence site in the coastal province of Syria of Latacia.
The reason for the explosion is unknown, he said.
Due to the conviction of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The 202 survivors and relatives of the 202 bombs killed in Bali in 2002 responded aggressively to the sentence handed down by the last of the conspiracies brought before the court and stated that Umar Patek was to be shot.
The Patek, who had spent almost 10 years in run as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he is granted parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of massacres as a result of an attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kut, during which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and wounded tens more.
It was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist charges, including church explosions throughout Indonesia in Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that a person called a “subversive” for his reputation as an explosive device master should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of the mother from Pert June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in a terrorist attack carried out by Patec and his accomplices almost ten years ago.
Almost inhibiting tears, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really believe he should follow the steps of other guys.
He's supposed to be in front of the shooting team,' said Ms. Cortin AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I'll no longer have grandchildren and I won't see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was launched parked outside the van immediately after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where the suicide bomber blew up the backpack with an explosive only 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into the coma and “death” for a month three times, connected to the lifesaving system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should share the participation of three other members of the Gemaa Islamia terrorist cell responsible for the bloodbath — Amrosi, Muhlas and Imama Sawida, who had been executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty most.
Save his life, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
The 20 years after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds were not so many.
The Patek is the last of the Bali terrorists to be brought before the court.
He had been hiding for almost ten years, but eventually he was detained in January 2011 in the Pakistan city of Abbotabad, where the United States troops killed Usama bin Laden, former head of Al-Qaida, less than four months later.
During the trial, an Agent of the FBI indicated that the intelligence was evidenced: Patec was in Pakistan to meet Bin Laden in an attempt to restore the links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't give up," said Ms. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much pain he had caused other people.
The sentence was handed down in advance of the tenth anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be held later this year in Bali and Australia.
“This year there will be a lot of tears,” said Ms. Cortin.
Patec can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Savage passengers can now use airplanes (but do not call from a mobile phone)”
Aviapassairs will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play, watch movies, and listen to music, but not to speak on mobile phones — according to the long-awaited new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Authority.
But passengers should not expect changes to take place immediately.
As soon as this change is realized, it will vary depending on the airline, says the FAU administrator Michael Wart at the press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft are in line with the new guidelines and that they update their training manuals for flight crew members and the regulations on the layout of devices in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that had already submitted plans.
“ Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Currently, passengers are obliged to turn off their smartphones, jets and other devices as soon as the airplane door is closed.
They should not restart them until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain gives them “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is declining to land and not to include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic disturbances may allow passengers to use these devices during the взлет, landing and steering, FAU stated.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified to enable passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Corporate Conductors, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve it), it will be a winless option,” Glading said.
We're frankly tired of feeling “school-care” when it comes to this issue.
But connecting to the Internet for surfing, sharing e-mails, text messages or downloading data will still be prohibited at altitudes of less than 10,000 feet, reported by the agency.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, jets and other devices to the airplane.
Thus, there is still no "Slove with Friends" — an intellectual internet game in which Actor Alec Boldwin played in his smartphone in 2011 when the event occurred: an actor was removed from an American Airlines aircraft for refusing to turn the device off while the aircraft was off the landing.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the baggage compartment, as they can traumatize someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls in flight will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Liaison Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may remove the ban on certain electronic devices during the take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Council for Transport Safety, a national expert on CBS News Transport Safety, stated that cellular phones are still considered to be a risk.
“The cell phones are indeed a problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know, thanks to the FSS, that they can cause disturbances for the cell phones when the aircraft is in the air,” said Rosenker.
The sectoral advisory committee established by FAU to examine this issue recommended last month that the Government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure on FAU has increased to reduce restrictions on its use.
Critics such as the Senator-Democrat of Missouri Claire McCashkill state argue that there are no good reasons for security for bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began carrying FM radio accepters, high-tech geggets of the time.
New airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAU as sustainable to electronic disturbances.
Airlines have been offering the use of Wi-Fi at cruise height for several years.
Modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disturbance.
The vast majority of airlines are adapted to wider use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines, said Wart.
Today’s electronic devices usually emit radio signals far lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, emit only minimal signals when translating pages.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to mitigate the restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, company representatives downloaded a whole airliner with their electronic books reader and flyed on Kindle to verify the problems but never found them.
The members of the Advisory Committee of FAU expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Passengers stated that the interference with the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual reports of pilots confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of these reports were very old.
Nevertheless, the Committee recommended that the pilots be allowed to request passengers to disengage devices during light-signalling landings.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sound step to meet passengers who are now using many technology devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director-General of the U.S. Tourist Association.
Autoschools will be able to conduct driving rights examinations
Examinations on driving rights will be able to accept private companies with their own computerized automobile.
This is written by Commersant, referring to the draft Government Regulation on the Permission to Control of Vehicles.
According to the newspaper, there are now only about 30 such dramas in Russia.
The students of such “privileged” schools are expected to count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the General Inspectorate will monitor the examinations every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory examinations and more than 20% of the students do not surrender the first time, such school will be deprived of the privileges of half a year.
The technical requirements for dramas contained in the draft decision of the Government enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheeled driving training.
As of 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass an examination in urban traffic to obtain A rights.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to employ foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird thrown in the air into a safe place from a drilling plant in the North Sea is released back into the wild
A bird thrown in the air to the shore after being found in a depleted state on a North Sea petroleum high was released back into wildlife.
This water pastor was placed in a helicopter to Aberdine last month and then in the Scottish Office of the Animal Abuse Prevention Society (SPCA) in the rescue centre in Alasa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water shepherd is probably a winter migrants from North Europe who have entered a strong wind zone over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has been weakened and has been able to find refuge on a petroleum raid.
He added: "She was unable to fly again, so they asked us for help."
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the European elite ready to business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the commitment to gather business representatives and to determine what changes British welfare and job makers want to see with the EU.
To that end, we ordered the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to speak about Britain, business and EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, representing a wide range of businesses in Britain in size, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will be surprising to many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to countries that are modernizing and growing while the EU countries are stagnating.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than waste time on a long and difficult process of reforming the improper EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antimonopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels are now outweighing the benefits of finding in the trade zone of Europe, even 40 per cent of the major businesses, traditionally the most pro-European-based companies.
The most recent and most significant, our business leaders survey found that the obvious majority wanted Great Britain to undertake a course to change the treaty and relations with the EU based on trade rather than on policies.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that business is insisting on a “significant change”, which will return authority to Britain.
The high rates — the achievement of changes in the treaty and the better conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent shift in voting in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to Britain.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters the path of a closer economic and financial association.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and, as the results of our survey show, for business, this means an increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels ' normative activities.
U.S. Special Services Listen to Pope's personal phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the vigilance of the U.S. Special Service.
New documents from Edward Snowen's collection show that the U.S. intelligence was listening to all the talks of previous Pope Benedict, and now he's apprehensive to Pope Francisk.
His phone began to be listened before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also monitored.
What in the United States was of particular importance.
The special service joined the cardinal cell phones that met in Rome to pick the next pope.
The telephones of the residence where the concubine lived were also heard.
The American spies listened to all the main papal candidates to prevent the presence of undesirable figures on it for Washington.
The Panorama magazine says that the U.S. big ear continued to intercept преlats before the end of the concubine on March 12.
It is alleged that the United States has since 2005 identified Argentine Archbishop Bergolio as the future of the Pope of Rome.
The American Intelligence also followed up negotiations on the election of the new President of the Bank of the Vatican.
The Italian magazine reports that the U.S. Roman Embassy continues to operate by a secret group of CIA and ANC operators who obtain information on policies and financial flows.
The Vatican, in turn, conciliatedly declared that he was not concerned by the American “proof”, even if it was taking place.
The U.S. leadership has no secrets.
A special photographer for the Olympic Cookie
The Russian Bank issued a memorial note on the city of Sochi on Wednesday, where the Olympic Games will be held in the winter.
The nominal bills are 100 roubles.
But online bloggers are already actively embroiling in about a memorial note.
Following the presentation of the Olympic Bulletin on October 30, they noted that the image of a snobbery can be found in photobanks.
In particular, in the free StockExchange photo storage, where the photograph was dated 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop class published on the Russian Mega Overview website on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it was already used in RugGear's Smartphone ad.
The Olympics note is done in a blue blue gamma.
On the one hand, a snoubardist flying over Sochi, on the other, a form of the Olympic Stadium and the Jar Ptina.
The designer of the notebook, Paul Bushhuev, won the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts of Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered, mining, freezing, and jumping from the trumplin, but eventually selected a snoombird, as it was a relatively young sport.
According to the CB source, the regulator is not indifferent to the public ' s view of the wide dissemination of the image of a snoubbridge from the Olympic note and is now exploring the situation.
And in Gostic, there's not too much concern about the noise around the Olympic note.
The Head of the Press Service of the Lord Natalia Nikiforov stated to “Envegetation” that all the arguments about the plagiate are funny.
The Snowbird will be turned to the right, the photos on the network on the left, clarified Nikiforov.
The person on the photo session for the building of a bathroom was taken from different locations, then the final picture was selected, and it was characteristic of the outside of the snobbery.
She also noted that copyright laws did not apply to the Olympic note, since the artist had received wages for work.
In the view of the experts, the discussion on the image on the Olympic Campaign was positive.
Knowledge of the image on the buyer, plus for its promotion, is considered by the executive director of the NP "Rus Brend" by Alexei Povers.
It is difficult to prove a 100 per cent similarity to the image on the buyer and in the photobanks, so it is unlikely that an appeal against intellectual property would be made against the image.
For the first time, the Olympics note appeared in China, and the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 were released a ten-Yuan note.
Russia decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced the Russians to drink less beer
Russian beer's got a bad mood.
According to their assumptions, beer consumption in the country will remain at the previous level next year, which is best.
Although the businessmen originally counted on growth.
After all, the current year has failed: sales fell by 7 per cent.
The head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the President of the Council of the Russian Beast Union, Isaac Sheps, at the third annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demand in Russia, which just ended in Moscow.
It discussed public market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian market for beer has already decreased by 18 per cent, as in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and trafficking of beer, a small amount of alcohol, reported to the Sheps audience.
In no country of the world, there is no such severe limitation on the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of all new and new non-legal prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer said that many legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse did not have a special impact, but there were still new initiatives.
More painfully, the beer manufacturers had struck the ban imposed this year on selling alcohol in the cyos.
"We lost 35,000 consumers right away," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, two projections are in the beer.
Optimistic is the one that the Sheps spoke of: the sale of the penny will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic will fall by another 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the class of mass consumers to the premium class, and beer will be less, but it will be more expensive.
However, the radical effects of the fall of sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
“I have observed that the level of alcohol disease remains roughly the same,” said doctor Alexey Sotnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the proportion of patients who use surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who have smeared alcoholic beverages like Yaguara, whereas ten years ago it was the most predominant “firing” alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Thord Automobile factory in All-World.
According to trade unions, all the prisoners were compensated.
However, the issue of reducing production in the region was more acute than the problems of workers.
At the meeting, the deputy of ZakSah Alexei Etmanov, said that some 600 people had been cut down at the factory of the Ford Company in All-World.
He said that this had taken place in September, when some 600 people had left the factory under the voluntary dismissal programme, which had been developed with the union of the organization.
Several salaries were proposed for workers who decided to quit their own business.
As a result, the vast majority left jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, this number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be the case.
However, in the next two years, the authorities did not plan to adopt any programme of support for pro-private enterprises,” he explained, adding that the Government did not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the significant reduction in jobs.
In the Ford, this information is neither refuted nor confirmed.
We're waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as he gets out, we're going to publish it.
Talking about the reduction of workers at the Ford factory in the All-World is a long time ago.
For example, the company’s plans to dismiss 600 people were known in September.
Previously, the factory had stated that the production of cars had been suspended.
For reasons, the factory was called the fall in the demand for vehicles in Russia.
According to Petrostat, industrial production in Lenoblest has declined by 5.4 per cent as a result of nine months of 2013.
Vehicle and equipment production decreased by 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, mobiles can be used during the air and landing of the aircraft
New regulations for the safety of mobile devices during the air and landing of airliners are approved in the United States, reports BBC Television Corporation.
The U.S. airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and planks throughout the entire flight, and the new rules will start by the end of 2013.
However, Internet connections to receive and send e-mail will be prohibited during flights at altitudes of less than 3 kilometres.
Owing to the risk of disruption of air traffic controls, hundreds of votes will continue to be banned.
Aviation passengers will thus be allowed to read electronic books, play tablets and other gears, and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices throughout the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Authority that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobiles on aircraft and aircraft controls.
According to the source, for example the United States, the current standards for the use of electronic devices in flight could also be revised in Britain.
A new name for the Russian Mafia in the U.S. is the "Bracy."
This week the black list of the Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance introduced three representatives of Russia, two Uzbek nationals and an Israeli to the “Bratsk circle”.
One Russian was the famous singer, Gregory Leps, who is suspected of transporting money for the group.
On the U.S. black list of 22 people involved in the Brazilian community and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts have expressed doubts that such an organization exists.
The statement on the "Bracy" is more based on attempts to combine disparate criminal groups, previously stated by the expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeottie of the University of New York.
In his view, the "Bracy" reflects the popular perception of "Russian Mafia".
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anyone else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” quotes Mr. Galeotty, the American Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime Research.
Mr. Galeotty agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shellie University.
"If they act together, it is more like a criminal network but not an organization," she quotes the Centre for Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotty suggested that the "Bratus circle" was bringing together more closely approached Russian thief in the Aslan Usojan law known as Dead Hassan.
Criminal authority was killed in January this year.
For example, Lashashanasvili and Zechariya Kalashov, who had completed the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dead Hassan and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was a nephew of Dedo Hasan.
However, Mr. Galeottie noted that some individuals were not related to Usayan.
In his view, all of them were more likely to be combined with general financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
In the meantime, the scandal about the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, drew the attention of Creml.
Naturally, we hope that we will receive more detailed information from our American partner colleagues, for which it has been decided why it has been added to such lists, said the Spokesman of the Head of State of Dmitry Peakov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
Like all citizens of the RF, its interests will be protected.
Head of Gasproma Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere.
The start of the Southern Flux pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the head of Gazproma.
“A marking event has taken place today: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Flow, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” said Chairman Gasproma Alexey Miller in his statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
The Southern Flow is designed to diversify Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual contract between Gasprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of the European gas of Russia, raises the risk of conventional routes, say officials.
Miller stated that direct communication with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries had been eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Flow at a reduced price as soon as the project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity for the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staff members were accused of sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission became aware
Two staff members of YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children prior to charges in 2011 against a childcare institution in Karingbach Jonathan Lord, reported to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
However, the Commission ' s opening statement stated that it had “no time to deal with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philippe Haira, was asked about one case when an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes and another case where the trainer of the sports gym at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayr told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He recognized that YMCA had also admitted inaccurate in its opening speech to the Commission, stating that “external reviews of YMCA, which recognized that YMCA was in the first line of child safety”.
The evidence provided by the commissions indicates that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of four possible quality evaluations performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayre, who had entered YMCA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the lower management had failed by hiring Lord and was also unable to ensure a clear understanding by the staff of their obligations regarding reporting violations of child security policies.
Previously this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two-year work at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the assumption that the corporate ethics of YMCA had prevented staff from reporting the violations of the Lord in the area of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, was personally caring for them, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was led by Lord and asked to teach her the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour, showed that Jackie Barnath, the guardian of the YMCA office in Karingbahe, who was the leader of Lord, had found Jackie Barnath, “a very frightening and often inaccessible place”.
The Executive Director said that he did not accept an explanation from staff members that they were uncomfortable to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord had led them to think of the need to report it.
Mr. Hayr said that he had presented to the JMCA Board of New South Wales his view that the lesson for the organization of “the events with Jonathan Lord” was not “tolerated by the provision of information” by the staff members and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements was taken by the Director General of YMCA for the custody of the children of Liam Whitley shortly after the charges were made.
He said that it was intended to prevent the deterioration of evidence, but “rebuilt” and that decision had not been implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during the work of Jonathan Lord in 2009 - 2011, reported to the Commission an expert on childbilling, Professor Stephen Smolboun of the Griffith University.
He said that there were “severe problems” in recruiting, selecting, training, training and controlling staff.
Hearings deferred until 20 December.

Tony Blair said he would take the chance of returning as British Prime Minister but acknowledged that it was unlikely to return.
The 59-year-old politician, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his post, expressed his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years of leadership, Blair has largely avoided discussions on British policy, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Quartet of Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question of whether he would have returned to Prime Minister's office, Blair, according to London Evening Standard, said, “Yes, of course, but this is not likely to happen, so...”

Look at Cocoa, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the connosporting activities travelling to Cardiff to fight for the Lunch Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolchild, just a few months earlier, who had taken his first steps, this kid and his pet, Scottish pony Toffy, leaned through three tourists to take the lead, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple, the same growth, received high estimates for the appearance, behaviour and style of the annual contest, which is held by the Sannibenk Conna Sport Centre in Radri, near Cardiff.
Having come to a general view of men and women in elegant cotton hats, he blew his crap and haughtyly spent a round of two-year-old Toffi.
The judges commended Fenton for his not having developed congenital ability to deal with horses for years.
And Toffy received the highest estimate for the appearance and nature.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday last March, and since then he has been working with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffy make a great duet."
They had many rivals, but the two went out with a golden cup and a rose.
It was just his second speech with Toffy, and we were all excited when he won.
The strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, that near Abb-Wayle in South Wales, walks along the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Hawels, who is exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole public was struck and shouted and smashed.”
He ran through the sand all over the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy from animals — he loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two chicks he cares about.
As he begins, he will be able to participate in the Lashadi Year soon — and I am confident that he will speak well.
The representative of this annual convoy said, “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to deal with his pony”.
Together they're a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their appearance and their presentation on the ring.
They evaluate the coherence of the pony and the factory, Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton helped his attractive dress, he really looked good in his role.
Published Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a call for the release of the accused in the slander of the reporter, must be reorganized, reports the press governor.
The New Express of Guangzhou made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yungjou.
But Mr. Chen subsequently admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
The New Exprese should now be “the complete error correction process”, according to the regulator.
The order of “correct correction” came from the Guandouan Press and Publications, Radio, Cinema and Television Office.
Preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group had published several false reports of the registered Zoomlion Exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The New Expression Revision Guide was dissorted, ” says the regulatory statement.
He reports that it has been decided “to impose administrative sanctions on Chen Yungjou in the form of a revocation of his reporter's licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct the errors of New Express and recommended that it investigate the situation of the newspaper and immediately amend the New Express leadership.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Expression, in which he claimed financial violations in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper issued two calls for his release in the first row, stating that it supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on State television, recognizing that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the whole news media industry and its ability to be trustworthy to the public,” he said to the CTV State broadcasting company.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my guilt.
Following Mr. Chen's confessions, New Express published apology on the front strip, stating that the newspaper had failed to verify his reports properly.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects have confessed on television.
Experts say that the practice of extraction of confessions in China continues to be widespread, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit the authorities from compelling someone to speak in self-response.
U.S. Tunnel detected — Mexico for the transport of drugs equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico has been found with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel with four feet wide by three feet as one of the most complex secret moves they have ever discovered.
This tunnel, which has the length of nearly six football fields, links warehouses near the city of Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is filled with unrecognised warehouses, facilitating the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were unrecognised through it, as the authorities stated.
According to judicial records, law enforcement officials confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and £327 in the detection of a tunnel.
Three men who, according to law enforcement officials, worked as drivers were charged with the storage of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
They are sentenced to imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were detected in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which set up a difficult task for drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of approximately 700 yards equipped with railways from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
In Belarus, pensions increased since November
In Belarus, pensions have been increased since November of this year, and correspondents to BELTA have been informed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection's Chief Pension Administration.
Since 1 November this year, an adjustment to the average wage of employees in the Republic applied to the previous recalculation of pensions will be implemented, with a 5.4 per cent increase in the amount of pensions and the corresponding recalculation of pensions in accordance with Decree No. 478 of 21 October 2013 on the increase of pensions.
As a result of the recosting from November, labour pensions to age are estimated to be an average of 5.3 per cent.
The average age pension will be 295,000 Br2 million.
The increase in pensions relates to 2.4 million people in the Republic.
The expenditure of the Social Protection Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on higher pensions since November of this year will be increased by Br27.3 billion per month.
At the same time, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated in November of this year in connection with an increase in the income minimum average per capita budget.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 million, 47,000, 530, by 2.1 per cent, higher than the period from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, 2.1 per cent since 1 November will be increased to minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, promotions and supplements to pensions.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion to 0.
British Police are sending Assanja notice of extradition
The British police have now given notice to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assanja, who hid himself in the Embassy of Ecuador in London and sought asylum.
In Scottland Yard, it was stated that they had given the 40-year-old Australian “official demand to surrender” to the police station, adding that, in the event of non-compliance, it would be further subject to arrest.
Assanjo threatens to be extradited to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capacity under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, he hid himself on 19 June at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, seeking political asylum from this South American country.
Scottland Yard “provided a 40-year-old man ' s official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice”, as the Spokesman informed.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the service of the police notification.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible spying charges after the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. Diplomatic Depositories on the WikiLeaks website against the secretity of the website.
Driving driver with a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs, fined by 1,000 pounds
The vehicle was fined 1,000 £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot beverage between legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howi, from Typtri, Essex, was observed driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track at Braintri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry him between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester Howi, he admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penal points to his driving certificate resulted in a six-month ban on driving.
Howi also pledged to pay $90 and additional $100 to assist victims of crime.
A tax for foreign real estate owners will make the London bubble flourish
Treasury carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital taxation measure but awaits a final decision from Mr. Osborn, who, in the 2012 budget, introduced a 7 per cent public tax rate for houses worth more than 2 million dollars and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in association rather than as individuals.
To date, the State for residential property in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to £708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, is already exceeding the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, north-eastern, north-west, Yorkshire and Hambir together.
Mr. Cook stated: “After the increase in the State's service to expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against evasion, it is very difficult to claim that taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the influence of an older municipal tax system.”
“But this may result in some foreign investors reluctantly buying real estate in London or the current owners would not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate — the top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market at the price — in the London rich southwest belt, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by record 11.8 per cent in the past year.
According to a study by Savills, the prices at the centre of London continued to show a steady growth of 5.6 per cent in annual calculations, but they were hampered by an active “circraft market” with splashing prices in south-west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tails are related to its mood.
Early research has shown that happy dogs spin their tail on the right side (from the dog’s point of view), while disturbed dogs wag their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family can notice these fine differences in tailing and reacting to them.
Professor Georgeio Vallortigar, a neurobiologist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the formation of motivators that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He added that just as a human, the dogs with the right part of the brain control the left side of the body and vice versa, and two hemispheres play different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs react to the tails of other dogs, researchers watched animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of animal heartbeat and analyzed their behavior.
We may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Professor Vallortigar said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs, either naturalistic versions, or silhouettes to rid themselves of any other distortive factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and guide the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest, the unexpressed dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the tailing dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that their tail was tilted mainly to the left, their heartbeat increased and they looked disturbed.
Professor Vallortigar said that he didn't think the dogs were deliberately interacting with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience, what movements they should worry about, and what movements they should not worry about.
He observes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their tail is related to friendlier behavior and the right side is less friendly, the dog responds on the basis of that experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians, and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
A dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, an inviting scientist at the Bristol University Veterinary School, said that this was not the first study to verify whether the left and right sides were relevant to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists at Lincoln University found that dogs would turn their heads to the left if they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right if they looked at a happy dog.
In another study at the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Obstacles were more likely to approach a work dog when the tail was directed to the left, not to the right, instead of being disturbed, — the opposite of the behavior of the Italian research.”
He said that differences might be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be a useful study of how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“ While there is sufficient evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not an exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct can be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails sometimes go one way or another.
Arctic Monkeys postpone a concert to the Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease.
Rock group Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to the Glasgow after her vocalist had diagnosed Laringitis.
This Sheffild group was scheduled to speak on the Hydro city concert site on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s disease caused them to carry the show.

Pope Francis will call the first cardinals in February
Pope Francesk will bring new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as declared on Thursday by the Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are choosing the pope, so that Francisk will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in his successor's choice.
There are now 201 cardinal.
However, after a cardinal age of 80, he is no longer able to participate in the papal election, which is the prerogative of the group of 120 “Cardinals”.
In announcement of this news, the Vatican Spokesman, Father Federico Lombardy, said that a meeting of all current cardinals known as a conspiracy would be held prior to the San ceremony.
“Papa Francisk decided to report in advance on his decision to convene a conspiracy in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world,” said Lombardy.
Jack Valero, of Catholic voices, said that by February, the number of electoral cardinals would probably decrease.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as it is necessary to bring the number of voter cardinals back to 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he would like.
The conspiracy next year will be important because it will be the first one since Francesk's election in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe, and especially for Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he noted.
In South America, 40 percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a few cardinals.
These will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who are mandated to seek ways of reforming the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that “only possible” Francis would turn to cardinals for advice.
But we have not been in such a situation before — all for us for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually taking the cardinal of the Bishops from the big parishes, but Francisk was “a full of surprises — so we don't know who he would call.”
GM releasing a number of new peaks in the United States to refurbish seat backs
General Motors Co withdraws almost 19,000 completely new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models in 2014 to address problems with the manual control of seat backslash, in accordance with the Friday notification from U.S. regulators in the area of vehicle safety.
On some of the peaks, the front seats may have a defect in the back slope mechanism.
As a result of seat backing, seats are not in conformity with federal vehicle safety standards on head restraints.
“The head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passenger at the rear of the vehicle by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
The models revoked were produced from 1 August to 10 September.
The release of GM peaks started in June and represents the most important launching of a car into a serial production for the lead American autoproducer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the peak defect in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration was unable to consider the notification to the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the sale of cars in October.
The sales of the Silverado and Sierra peaks, which were modernized for the 2014 model series, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM stated on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 peaks of Silverado and 16,503 peaks of Sierra.
GM shares in the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4 per cent on Friday day to $37.47.
Obama’s Despair Cry
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the republican obstruction to nullify commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify the problem of the Obama Health System Reformed Web site, the attack of unmanned pilots
Obama 2008 Memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Second School of Medicine at Harvard University.
I'm reading a terrible sad book in these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me in times of disappointment at the Second School of Medicine and restore hope in me.
It is called “Dersity for Victory”, and it is the memoirs of the 2008 Barak Obama Presidential Campaign.
When I finish my report to my patients at night and go to bed, this book brings me back at a time when the politics inspired millions of people and the speeches could be enthusiastic.
The election victory was a powerful one, and the leading news programmes paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young strategy team was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At Obama ' s entry into the post in 2008, the level of support was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
The return in the present is a rude awakening, as is the emergence from the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memorial, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years that have passed since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for its great and diverse achievements, from the adoption of the law on affordable health care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, to the repeal of the rule “Do not ask, don't talk”, the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and closing the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of Obama's administration, defending it before colleagues and peers, I ended up with the explanations I could provide.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The Republican obstructionism cannot explain the permission to hear foreign leaders or to strike unmanned children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of detectors who disclose the misconduct of the Government.
It cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anwar Al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or the failure to comply with the limits of public finance and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He could not justify the conclusions of the report, which stated that the efforts made by the White House to silence the media were “the most aggressive... since the Nixon administration”.
Recently, it was unable to justify that it was unable to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable health care.
I don't know if that's what I should expect.
Should I at 18 years of age realize that leadership can conflict with the political campaigns that precede him?
Obviously, the work of the elected office is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and incidental events such as the fear of Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have cited above show that they were largely the choice of the administration.
And that's what bothers me most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, and it seemed that he was unable to decide on his own policies or views.
I believed that, within my second term, Obama, freed from the pressures of future elections, would justify the hopes we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating dropped below 45 per cent this week, returning to 2008 through the book became much more difficult.
It makes me miss many of the promises that have gone away.
This week, I read that part of the book that describes how Clinton caused a deaf defeat to Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting on the reasons for failure, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goal.
“ I want us to return our attractiveness, ” he said.
“We must remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in that comment belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer asserts that Deputy Tony Abbot has a conflict of interest with regard to child leave.
Deputy Millionaire Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbot had a conflict of interest in child leave because his daughters could get pregnant and benefit from it.
This magnet of the mining industry, with an unresolved carbon tax dispute of $6 million, made this statement at the time he tried to evade the question of whether he had a conflict.
The Joint Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be critical in deciding on the abolition of carbon taxes and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbot's daughter would personally win from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the Electoral Commission formally declared Mr. Palmer a victor in the fight for the place of Sanshein-Cost of the Ferfax electoral district, with a peak of 53 votes after the recalculation of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the process of counting votes in the elections to expedite the process.
Tony Abbot's daughter Francis and Bridgite.
Should the election be decided two months after we voted?
“We need a better system, ” he said.
Why don't we have to have this system to come, put our data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 18:30 that night?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in ballot papers.
Is that because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Use a pencil today seems strange.
The Electoral Commission examines opportunities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, a 59-year-old, said that his programme included the international airport for Sãošin Kost and would “very seriously” take his new work.
The post of State involves the service of the community.
“We do not seek any reward except for the gratitude of history, for serving this county at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS Strips two exchange trailers
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily suspended two traders in its Currency Operations Unit, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is further evidence that global checks by the controllers of the alleged exchange-market manipulations are rapidly taking turns.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations related to the largest financial market in the world, with daily flows of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff who have been dismissed during an initiating investigation, which is overlapped with a scandal related to the interbank rate of LIBOR manipulation.
Refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators,” reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail and instant messaging records that he received and sent to his former trader, the British Governing Body, the Financial Performance Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, departed from the RBS in 2010 and is known to have been granted leave at his current position as head of European spontaneous exchange bidding in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, leader of European spontaneous bids in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS, was suspended by the bank Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
The instant communication group, Mr. Asher, included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that he had taken action against some of his staff after the Swiss Finma regulator said that he was investigating the alleged manipulations in the currency market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators worldwide — the European Commission, Finma, the Antimonopoly Authority of Switzerland Weko, FCA, the U.S. Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a conspiracy to influence the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal audits or received requests from regulators for information, said the acquaintances.
Banks have examined instantaneous communications and e-mails in several years in search of offences.
The news of verification has spurred traders in the area of activities, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of revenues for the investment banks, which this year, however, have encountered difficulties owing to the low currency volatility deteriorating opportunities for traders.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and high-level currency market, but older traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the enormous volume of daily trades in the currency market, fragmentation of liquidity between different trade platforms and wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “you can begin to influence the market for a very small price”.
This news came on the same day as the Credit Suisse Bank announced that one of the traders of the London Exchange Stocks Division had been fired this week, after it had damaged nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has notified the relevant authorities without delay and has cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader has acted alone and that the issue has been localized,” reported Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported the Obama Health Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has now ruled that Barak Obama's Significant Law on Health is constitutional, which is a major victory for the Obama Administration.
By votes 5 to 4, the judges ruled that individual orders under the Patient Protection Act and accessible health care required citizens to acquire health insurance prior to 2014 or to pay a fine were constitutional in accordance with the tax authority of the Government.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court has also upheld the remaining sections of this 2,700 country law, and further decided that the requirement of the health law that the states should improve compliance with the Medicaid programme, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutionally forced.
The bill was blocked by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the major Republican candidates to the Presidents during the 2012 primordial election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football is the cause of the difference?
In the Office of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts discussed how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals were the banning of football in the North Caucasus, because of the fact that the game was a scandal and a discord.
Speaker Sergei Narichkin recalled recent developments in Birulev and said that in order to reduce “a degree of social tension”, policies and media should be correct in their comments.
He must have meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovsky, who, in one of the television shows, threatened to be surrounded by a barbed wire in the Caucasus if they didn't want to limit the fertility...
All speakers spoke of measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and on measures to harmonize relations among the Russian peoples, which gave debates a comprehension.
Maxim Grigorev stated that the events in Birulev were a “model conflict that could have been predicted”, but “we have too many people and entities to answer these questions”, and seven nuns with no eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which has long been practised by Europe by the public, has failed and must be sought.
Historian Yuri Petrov had high hopes for a new unified book of history.
“There is more to be done to create a handbook on the history of the peoples' culture, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that they live in Daghestan and vice versa,” he said.
Hennadius Zuganov proposed to impose criminal responsibility for "the call for Russia's dismemberment," "if in the U.S. on the radio, you have to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski was trying hard not to incite.
As usual, he accused journalists who have endured severe national problems to the public debate, "In the dust of the debate, there's little to say!"
Vladimir Vasilev, leader of the Uniform Russia faction, promptly advised journalists to conclude a “wart” and agree to speak on the subject carefully, and then the same commitments can take on policy.
We had some 30 laws that regulated migration, and the order as a whole had been established, Mr. Vasilev stated.
As an example, he cited the law that imposes responsibility on regional and municipal authorities for international peace in their territory.
However, Ludmila Andricenko was not appreciative about this law: there is no “clear idea of what adaptation, mechanisms and limits are involved in migrants.
Substantives would then be interpreted in a different manner.
In addition, municipalities do not have the staff required to deal with such complex issues, no means, and the methodological recommendations they could use are not available to them....
The head of the Duma Committee for Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliyev, proposed the establishment of a special department with the horrible title “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tishkov, who was headed by a similar department in the 1990s that was later abolished, opposed.
It is sufficient to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio” to be approached if so.
“We are walking across the edge, the shells are breaking nearby, and it is very important for representatives of different ethnos and religions to speak together against provocations, and this work should be given decent information support,” said the representative of the CPC on relationships to the society of the Universe Chaplin.
No neutrality of the State with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religion, should, in his view, be.
And Olig Neil led the discussion to an unexpected direction, saying, "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, they are still searching for, but they are driven by a wrong path," he said.
"Not that road" is the development of football, "that football players beat all the crowds, and the flags foam, and their comrades stone each other...
Maybe we don't need soccer like that.
There's another type of sport, the Reggie is called...
"They won't be in the world in this kind of sport!", he fervently said.
No one will play in the Caucasus Regbi!
You're still going to give them a ride!
We need to know the national features, it's like the loader "Please" to offer...
In Yaroslavl, the wild behavior in the rostrum was characterized by the Moscow Club, during a game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country...
The head of the RFS Monitoring and Disciplinary Committee, Arthur Grigorianz, reported that Cuban was fined by 500,000 rubles, handed over by SE Correspondent Philipp PAPENKOV from the House of Football.
Such sanctions against the Redodar Club are applied for the burning of the Daghestan flag by the chicks on the rostrum during the 14th tour game against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from RFPL.
We have explored all available materials.
For the misconduct of the Cuban spectators, it is fined by 500,000 rubles.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei filed an action on Nortel's patent
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims on Thursday against mobile phone producers, including the Google company, the price of which she was auctioned by Nortel's bankruptcy.
The Rockstar Consortium, which purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel's patent, filed claims for violation of patent rights before the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is in joint ownership of Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google's accused of breaking seven patents.
These patents cover technology that helps to compare the keywords of Internet search with the appropriate advertising, states the claim, which is the basis for Google search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on Android's operating system from Google, which is highly competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
He played the Nortel Stockstar Patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and in this transaction the determinant was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Despite the failure of attempts to auction patents that are the subject of the claim, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” states the court.
Rockstar demands increased damages from Google because he claims that Google patent rights are deliberate, according to the claim.
Egypt takes the oath of the first freely elected President
Mohammed Murcy accepts the oath, but the day of his triumph is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Murcia promised “new Egypt” when he swore, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, which was overturned 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Murcia also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of State in Egypt, after the renouncement of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He vowed to 18 judges in black mantles in a courthouse on the coast of Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are seeking a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” said Murcy during the solemn ceremony displayed in direct air on State television.
“Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Murcy, a 60-year-old engineer with American education from the Bratew-Muslim, a fundamentalist group, which was mostly out of 84 years of existence, a banned organization that served as a target for the rigid actions of successive Governments.
The building guarded hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Murcia arrived with a small cartage shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the court building to welcome the new President, and unlike the Presidential pump of Mubarak's times, the movement was stopped for only a short time to miss its convoy on a typically live road connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although Murcy has been ridiculed as a non-charismatic “relief wheel” of Bratev, his personal prestige has increased dramatically since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to represent himself not only as an Islamist candidate but also as all those who want to bring the 2011 rebellion to the end of the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern State,” said Mursie, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, the judges in the tough wooden panels where he took the oath.
Murcy later went to Cairo University, where he had to make his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra who carried out a public hymn during which he stood on a “smart stand”.
A Feldmarschal Hussein Tantavay military officer was present.
His visit was met by the slogan “Army and the People — One Hand, ” which scanded hundreds of those who met at the University Main Lecture Hall.
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as an envelope for secular education, in the 1970s became the source of the Islamist Students ' Groups.
Mursie took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the revolt ended by Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year and promised to re-establish the President whose office was deprived of his office by a military council that took the case from the overthrown leader.
But by accepting a formal oath before the court, rather than before the Parliament, as accepted, he exercises the will of the military, and it is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursie’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theateral populist gestures.
A further meeting of the Tumen Region Engineering Association was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Road Manufacturer.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of steel electrical cooking pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study on the marketing of steel designs in Tumen area was conducted in 2011 with the emergence of a new owner.
It has been found that the region consumes more than 50,000 tonnes of cooking pipes per month.
Thereafter, it was decided to change the profile of the factory and to install the equipment for its production.
More than 7,000 tons of manufacture has been shipped this year.
Investments to the factory amounted to over 120 million roubles, and Denis Gribanov told me.
A new state is launched in October, allowing for an increase in assortimation.
The factory produces both a small profile of the pipe that is used for the temporal, small construction forms and in the furniture industry and a large one for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50,000 tonnes per year, which will be about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen area.
Despite the shift in activities, the number of employees in the enterprise has not decreased - now 157, and in new equipment plans - an increase of more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is being retrained and the necessary professionals are selected from existing ones.
A new longitudinal cutting aggregate is expected to be up to five millimetres thick in the next year, thus reducing the cost of products and another condition at a speed of up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, enterprises are about to learn the production of tubes that are used in the housing and communal sector.
The management of the enterprise aims to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumens ' needs for the product.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department, Leonid Ostroum, appealing to the Manufacturing Managers, recommended that more attention be given to modernization of machines.
The forms of public support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on credits for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of leasing it, are also directed.
The current year provides for the allocation of 150 million roubles, two thirds of which have already been spent.
The latter commission, which will consider subsidies contracts, shall adopt documents from enterprises until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of local producers ' participation in international fairs.
For the future year, the budget provides for the amount of 150 million roubles that can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
Five million will be allocated to the fairs, and 3 million will be allocated to energy conservation programmes.
Reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment in the southern Tumen area for the petroleum gas complex has been reduced to 72 million rubles.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, this form of support would in the long run cease, as it was motivated by compensation for the mining tax that oil companies had paid to the regional budget.
At present, they do not do so and subsidies become direct cost-benefit obligations of the region.
In that regard, the Government considers the direct support of industrial enterprises, rather than the financing of the oil industry, to be a priority.
The budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in the workplace.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the situation with regard to petroleum.
The substantiation for their equipment is a competitive advantage of the southern Tumen industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the medium-strip of Russia, where the cheaper labour force is.
In addition, the continuity of the new owner of the TNC-XB, Rosnifth, which has not yet placed his orders in the prisons, is unclear.
The Watt Project Agreement expires in 2013 and no extension requests have been received.
Currently, southern enterprises specializing in oil-gas-related equipment cannot form a portfolio of orders for the future year.
The question remains open whether the taxes from the oil extracted in the Uwatt region will be received to the budget of the region or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the deposits.
Tomic will spend 240 hours on extremist socialist roles
The Lenin District Court of Tomska sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work by the city resident, who had placed on the social network a video of extremist orientation, reported to RIA Newsti on Friday by a representative of the provincial press court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page on a popular social network, which was included in a federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case has been instituted against him under the article of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Action aimed at inciting hatred and hostility, as well as at humiliating the dignity of a person committed publicly.
“The Leeni District Court has dealt with the case in a special manner and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned offence by imposing 240 hours of mandatory work”, said the agency's interview.
She added that the man fully confessed his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians that the price of goods had been collapsed since the signature of an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nicolas Azarov, is convinced that the prices in the country will fall considerably after the country signs an agreement on association with the European Union.
He stated this in communication with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties for importing goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
That would mean that prices should go down.
“This is about the goods that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices would not be that direct and indirect.
However, there should not be a price increase either.
So the reports on bildards, which have recently become quite numerous in our country, that the association with the EU is a price increase, it's not exactly, or if it's not, in fact, that's not true," -- summarized Azarov.
Investigators verify information on child abuse in Bisk
On 29 October, the media reported that one of the Bishk children ' s gardens had locked the child in the basement for educational purposes.
All circumstances are currently being clarified by investigators and legally assessed by the staff of the nursery.
After the accusation of the foolishness of Eugenia Vasilev,
Eugenia Vasilev, whose personal attention has been focused on the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous press publications, both on the abductions in Minoбороna and on her personal relationships with the Minister of Defence, Anatolia Serdukov, her poetry and the addiction to valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the Defense Service figure violated silence.
In an interview of Life News Vasilev, she said, "Of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
There was a blackmail to testify, or I'll be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court to prove our innocence.
We have 100 percent confidence in winning.
In doing so, we can conclude from the interview that perhaps most of all Vasilev was saying that she had no taste.
Probably referred to the statement by the official representative of the SC, Vladimir Markin, that the collection of paintings collected by the Defense Service case had found counterfeiting.
Among the apprehended property, there are a number of paintings that the master, confident of her deep knowledge of the arts, acquired as masterpieces of the world's painting.
However, an artisanal expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they had no artistic value and, in fact, were cheap forgeries”, noted Markin in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
Then they admitted that they weren't stolen from the Minoborna, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal points?
I think it's just an unprecedented thing," says Vasilev.
At the same time, on the question of whether she admits her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes she has been subjected to, Vasiliev stated: “No, of course.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation in this regard.
Just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today ' s SC statement that Vasilev was evading the investigation of the criminal case, the figurer ' s lawyer stated that he and his client “has not been able to get to know the material of the case”.
What led to the revelations of Vasilev, who still had no contact with the press, under house arrest?
How might a woman have failed to answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists "Comsomols" who claimed a couple of days ago that she was "invasived in a greater trance under house arrest" because of the report of Anatolia Serdukov's reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family's bones?
Victor Baranz in his article "Serdukov returned to his wife?" said, "Nearliers do not exclude that after such shock, she may become more conversational on interrogation."
Vasilev used to charge some of the illegal sale of real property of Minoбороna.

This tourist firm is now expecting its main full annual pre-tax profits from $325 to $340 million, compared with the previous projection of $305 to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are achieved, this will be a 12 to 17 per cent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had earned 8 per cent of the first half of its income and had started the second half of the year with good indicators, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the British.
“ From the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to earn a record of profits over a full year before deduction of interest and tax contributions, ” he said.
“This includes Australia and Britain, which usually bring us the largest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business recovered during the second half of the year, compensating a slightly weaker domestic market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in Britain, the Flight Centre's leisure business went well, while corporate clients were spending less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year and the profits were expected for the third full year in a row.
The Flight Centre rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.

In Ekaterinburg, the perpetrator killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, the police are conducting a search for a criminal who was brutally wronged with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the New Region press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlov region, the previous day in the Kyrov district of the Ural city, after the fire in a three-room apartment located in the Housing House on the street of Urala, two women were identified with signs of violent death.
Soon the identity of the dead was established.
It turns out it's sisters, one of them's Yekaterinburg's 44-year-old resident, and the other 33-year-old Orenburg district.
The worst apartment they rented a few days ago.
His investigation took control of the Chief Police Region, Mikhail Boord.
The internal affairs authorities have developed various versions of the killings, tested the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons inclined to do so.
In addition, it is set out the purpose for women to rent their apartment and where they lived before doing what they had been dealing with.
Schools called for increased attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare’s play, 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British artistic literature since 1914.
The examination will also provide “extraprogramme texts” to encourage wider reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will have to pass a separate graduation examination in the language with persistent recommendations for the choice of English literature as a separate examination.
The Department of Education should produce new English and mathematical curricula tomorrow, the first subjects under radical review.
It will amend other major items next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of examinations OFQUAL will present a revised structure of secondary school graduation, with a new system of evaluations and a lower level of course.
In the summer, Minister of Education Michael Gow said that “the broad consensus was reached that we should reform our system of examinations to re-enter public confidence”, insisting that school graduation exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Research shows that English schools spend less time in mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week, for a quarter, than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore holds about 138 hours.
Although there would be no formal requirement for more time in mathematics, coalition sources said that large school graduates in mathematics, combined with an elevated rating factor, would likely provide incentives for schools to provide additional education for the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be given to “purposes from real life”, including financial mathematics.
Hayhe tickets will cost tourists 2,200 roubles
Since tomorrow, tourists will begin to carry ships on the air cushion from the Good Newsk in Hayhae.
For those wishing to come to China, that means additional waste.
The puma ticket has traditionally been much more expensive than the heat.
As reported in the AmurASSO reference service, the cost of the usual ticket would be 2,200 roubles.
It's going to cost 2,800 roubles to travel through the hall of elevated comfort.
In that season, it was said that the tickets were not traveling: at the same price, the puma was carried by tourists and by the spring past, and the autumn year ago.
Dmitri Medvedev: GDP growth rates of RF are insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that its GDP growth is insufficient for the FM and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy by innovating, reports Reuters.
We planned this year to increase GDP in area 3%, maybe even a little more.
It's actually going to be a little less than 2%.
In the background of recession in a number of European countries, it may not be very bad, but for us, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
Now, it's very important that Russian companies, Russian business, get normal loans at normal prices, is the first thing they need to do," stressed the head of government.

Travel on mud, rivers and jungle to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical treatment in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there are few doctors — only one per 5,000
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 major heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 major heroes to become the Hero of the year CNN.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
During 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father return to life and relapse into an unconscious state, throwing himself into hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was traumatized in an accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
First, he had only a broken hand, but the infectious disease spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that resembled himself for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neuroscientists in Cameroon, ” said George Bwell.
If we had money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelly for years escorted his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“ It’s not easy, ” said Bwell.
- You can leave the house at 5:00 p.m., run to the hospital to be first, but you're not the first one.
Patients are a lot.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed dramatically since Father Bwelle died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 in Cameroon.
In the United States, for comparison, the ratio of 413 doctors is one.
And even if the Cameroonians were able to contact a doctor, many of them would have been unable to do so.
Two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of the health costs are private.
“ Their only problem is poverty, ” said Bwell.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their life.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and a lot of his fellow citizens, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year Dr. George Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-profit organization, which is organizing weekend visits to rural areas to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his team of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are imprisoned in vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies, and traveled through the crossed area to visit the needy villages.
They don't always have luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they come, they meet them as real heroes: it's a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that local residents can offer.
Free health care in these villages is indeed an occasion for the holiday, and Bwella, with its wide smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip, ” said Bwell.
They come from all over the neighborhood in a 60 - mile [60 km] radius of the village, and they walk.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment from malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive bones, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the Brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are typically carried out in the school, municipality or home building; patients come up and go to the post-operation zone to release the place for the next person.
Using the generator to light the operating and sanitary processing of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
This is a slow pace, but the brigade's determination is usually helping to support village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and keep working, ” said Bwell.
On Sunday, brigade members return to town, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations in the past year and they know that their assistance may be of great importance to those they assist.
One person explained that his free treatment operation would allow him to work again.
“This will change the future for me and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to these clinical treatments, surgeon Bwella is also working at nights in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It was this second work, he said, that it provided 60 per cent of its non-profit organization's funding; the rest was covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he's sleeping, ” said Katie O'Mally, a medical student at the Second Drexel University in Philadelphia, volunteer in Bwell.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to make money for the organization to continue the campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Mallie, coming from the United States and Europe to join Bwella in his tasks, it is an opportunity for practices that they would never have received at home.
“We have been able to assist in operations where we helped to remove blood spots or hold instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” said O'Malley.
As a secondary student, you would never have been able to do so in America.
Volonter students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often coming with donated medications.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training pays Bwell.
'He's no doubt a hero,' said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help Cameroon's people is endless.
For Bwelle, almost constant loading is not a heavy test.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promises is something that brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this job, ” said Bwelle.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it so people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME site and see what you can do to help.
Snoudden agreed to testify to Mercel
The Bundestag deputy Hans-Cristian Strebele met Moscow with Edward Snowen.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snouden could be questioned as a witness by the FRF Genocoral Procurator in the case of the possible hearing of the German Chancellor by the U.S. Snouden.
Snoudden expressed the readiness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knew very much.
Although the National Security Agency led by Kit Alexander blocked all its movements, Snowen is ready to come to Germany.
First, however, it is necessary to define clearly all the conditions for his arrival.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators are beginning to respond to a scandal around the U.S. spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the United States Department of Electronic Intelligence.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Machei, stated to the journalists at a press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, reports correspondent in BELTA.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkey relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the Government of the two countries will provide wide-ranging assistance and support to entrepreneurs who have direct trade and economic contacts among themselves,” said Vladimir Machei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions and provide maximum assistance to that end.
The Minister also reported that an 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkey Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, following which the protocol was signed.
Parties have developed a road map for Belarus-Turkey interaction, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and the search for new forms and directions of interaction.
“The proceedings of the past meeting have been met in full, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey are considering each other as trustworthy partners,” he said.
The Turkish Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that the two heads of foreign policy agencies had decided to continue to develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects during the negotiations.
The Minister believes that trade between Belarus and Turkey should be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, since there is unused potential in this area, he believes.
We have always had a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will further strengthen and expand in the future.
As well as all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic ties and for the successful operation of Turkish companies in Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to speak of health
Among the storms of criticism, President Obama went to a cloak yesterday with regard to his often repeated, unambiguous promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notices of discontinuing service delivery from their providers, Republicans have in recent days criticized the President for misleading the American society.
Yesterday, Obama subscribed to his original public promise.
“The majority of people with medical insurance that works can preserve it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
With regard to what he described as “a shock in the news” regarding the discontinuation of services, Obama called on American recipients to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain better, integrated health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than projected.
“You'll get better conditions,” he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the population buying insurance on their own could be forced to change plans because they did not meet the new standards required by the law on affordable health care.
“Let me tell these Americans: you deserve the best,” said Sibelius in her address to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who governed the implementation of the law on affordable health care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site had been “grimly bad” since October.
“ I’m upset and angry just like everything else, ” she said.
“I really want to return your trust.”
The irritated Sibelius dismissed this phrase, which was captured by the included microphone sitting behind her at the Chamber ' s hearings in the Chamber in the aftermath of a hot debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billi Long, a republican from the State of Missouri, as to whether she was obliged to enter the Obama health programme herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “Architator” of the law on affordable health care voluntarily did not renounce government-sponsored insurance for a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes to millions of Americans.
The Rosbalt Agency deprived the media of its status as a non-communicable armour.
On 31 October, Mosgorud decided to recognize an invalid licence for registration of the Rosbalt Agency, writes “Lanta”.
In deprivation of the Agreed Media status, Roskokomonodor insisted on systematic and gross violations of the media law.
An unpleasant precedent was set up in the process: the court considered it possible to close the media, de facto refusing the publication in the right to make counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"?
The ZAO “Information Agency Rosbalt” was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In subsequent years, the agency opened the second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The Agency also has representations in the former USSR countries.
Rosbalt has developed and operated as a federal information and analysis agency since 2001.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most known private media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the nucleus of the Agency ' s exclusive publications (and still form) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of publication to force structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
While Rosbalt had an extensive source base in various agencies, it was also suggested that Natala Chaplina, the wife of Victor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
The role of Chaplina in the Rosbalt leadership is not clear to the extent that it is often referred to as “project leader”.
The Director-General of the agency is Larisa Afonine, chief editor, Nicolas Ullianov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been listed in federal media ratings, either by quotation or by audience.
In October, the agency took a 25th place in the LiveInternet version of Russian media websites.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the rosbalt.ru site is about 150,000 unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), and the monthly average of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular material in the past five months is the note on the powerlessness of the Kremlin in relations with Ukraine, the death of the "Korol and the jokes" group, raids in the capital of Birulev.
The Rosbalt conflict with Roskomondor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law had entered into force, prohibiting journalists from censorship.
The statement found a banned lexicon in two of the videos published on the website (“Jigit from Redodor and Pussy Riot desecrated oil excavations”).
The further sides are described in different ways.
On the basis of the detected videos, Rosbalt was accused of gross and systematic violations of the media law and asked the court to take the licence from the agency.
The Rosbalta stated that the agency's claims were wrong: first, the videos were not drafted, secondly, the mother words were masked, and third, immediately after warning, the videos were removed from the site.
The representatives of the agency appealed the claims of Roskomádor to the World Court, and when Mosgorud adopted the claim of Roskomover on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 members of the world's judge have not ruled in favour of “Rosbalta”: Nikolai Ulyanov, chief editor, was found guilty of a violation of the Code on Administrative Offences and had been fined by 20,000 roubles, 10,000 per video.
Obviously, that prejudged the outcome of the hearing in Moscow -- if you abandon the thought that the outcome could have been prejudged before.
On 31 October, the court ruled that the “Rosbalt” registration certificate was invalid, depriving the media's status.
It cannot be said that the Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The Agency supported the Deputies of the Lord (the statement addressed to the Head of Roskomнадзор, Alexander Jarow, on 10 October, was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted at the initiative of the CRC).
The Head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Paul Gusev and the President of the Presidential Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotov, stated the wrongfulness of closing the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomondor even provided him with some guarantees that the case would not be reached before the licence was revoked.
The Rosbalt Court indicated that whose jurisdiction is safer for the media in Russia today is a big issue.
Syria destroyed chemical equipment
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons production capacity, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first phase of disarmament, Damascus has completed one day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy the production and other support facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisoning substances to be used by BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of poisoning substances or their chemicals must be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, poisoning substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
The international inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were reportedly killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste the time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemicals - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These productive capacities will now be closely monitored to prevent them from being repaired.
The next mile is mid-November: by this time, OPCW and Syrians should agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of already available stockpiles of poisoning substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly examined by Western intelligence agencies.
They would be willing to consult the inspectors with new facilities to check if they suspected that Damascus was not entirely frank.
It is estimated that this fire was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by the Russian mediation, destroy or unworkable all the capacity for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for filling in the equipment.
Now that this phase is over, the next step must be the destruction of the already existing chemicals of the Syrian army.
It is expected that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve and paralytic poisoning substances, petroleum gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
It requires that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities begin to agree on a timetable for action, which takes two weeks to do so.
The OPCW leader Jerry Smith stated that his inspectors had “exhibited the destruction of equipment”.
“They are no longer able to carry out further production or mixture of chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW statement states that the inspectors visited 21 out of 23 facilities in Syria and found that the shell and poisoning plants were either destroyed or brought into discomfort.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out the inspection, as stated in the document, but the equipment was transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical-producing infrastructure was “especially difficult”, as it had to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, it was not time for the inspectors to celebrate it until they were too busy.
John Carrie says in his unprecedented confession that the U.S. spy was “drawn unprecedentedly far”
John Carrie demonstrated the mitigation of U.S. surveillance tactics by making an unprecedented recognition that in some cases the U.S. spying “has gone unprecedentedly far”.
The Secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barak Obama, of being “in the autopilot” at Edward Snowen's heavy detection of the ANC spy activities.
These information leaks have placed the U.S. Government in a diplomatic scandal centre with its allies.
Speaking on videos at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and other members of the Government have actually taken some of the things that are happening on the autopilot because such an opportunity has already existed — both during the Second World War and during the very difficult years of the cold war and, of course, on 11 September”.
He was then the first high-ranking member of the United States Government to recognize that the United States spy had gone too far, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases this has gone unpleasantly far.
And the President is determined to shed light on the matter and explain itself to people, and is now undertaking a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has any sense of abuse.
I assure you that there is no mistreatment of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had worked for good reasons and that his operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are willing to explode themselves.
There is a radical extremism in the world, unreasonable and determined to kill people, explode people and attack Governments.
And if you were able to intercept this, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented the crashes of aircraft, buildings explosions and killings because we have been able to learn about these plans in advance.”
In the meantime, the U.S. legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to the alleged U.S. spying overseas and persuade the Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorist activities with the United States, said the chairman of the Senate Senate ' s subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday.
The Senator from Connecticut, Chris Murphy, said that he had interviewed members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to end participation in anti-terrorist organizations due to the disappointment of the National Security Agency ' s monitoring.
“For the interests of national security of the United States, it is indeed important that the Europeans remain our supporters for our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who is the first term and chairman of the European Senate International Relations Subcommittee, in an interview from Washington.
“And I go to Europe to make them realize that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programmes.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has deteriorated with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency stated this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Other discrepancies included documents published by Snouden, indicating that the NSA monitored the German Chancellor’s mobile phone, Angels Mercel, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, defended spying activities against allies as necessary and said that this was a customary case on both sides.
In the background of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to the members of the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would be composed of members of both parties and of the two chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be pronounced in the coming days.
He said that the travel programme was still under development.
While Murphy stated that the purpose of the visit was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “vigority for the best motive” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programmes they themselves used for many years.
“When we can change our tracking programmes to better protect the rights of the Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who are engaged in intelligence activities,” said Murphy.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerri should go to these weekends to the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States intelligence activities.
New members of public monitoring commissions will have increased the influence of prison guards
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) is able to approve new compositions of public observation commissions (FNCs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the voted option is adopted, the lobbis siloviks will increase their influence.
NCK is public structures that control conditions of detention in places of detention.
The works of Sergei Magnetsky and Leonida Rossjava, the turmoils in the penal colony -- it is through the FNC that the majority of the resonance incidents are reported behind the crate.
The FNC controls the fight between human rights defenders and the lobbista siloviks.
At the meeting of the JI working group on the formation of the FNC, I suggested that the selection criteria should be made for human rights experience.
"They didn't accept him and they made lists without the criteria," says Valerie Borczov.
The barrence is the current chairman of the Moscow Observatory and the Association of Independent Observers, the all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
In the home, he had drafted a law regulating the activities of the NCC by the deputy of the Lord of the Apple.
The JP Council should vote in favour of the Constituencies of ONC in 43 regions of the country.
For 1,800 vacant seats, fewer than a thousand wishing, and in Ingushetia and Cabardino-Balkariya, competitions were unable to organize owing to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a prenatal to vacancies.
NCK of Moscow is one of the few competition commissions, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borchev, the current capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 siloviks, and the option that is voting in the PK, the ratio is 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders were wanted to go to the capital commission.
At the same time, a representative of the Bio Brotherhood Vyacheslav Kalinin may re-enter the new membership.
He had been a member of ONC for three years, but he had never visited the prisoners.
The Borchev believes that the Forcesmen, by appointing their chairmanship of the FNC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not preclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of forcemen is coordinated by an ONC member of Anton Flowov, headed by the Russian Officials, an organization advocating the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies in the womb," said Anton Flower daily RBC.
He denies that he lobbys the movement of any lists and that he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opponents.
According to Florkova, he was not even interested in the list of OPs.
He considered the publication of Borsche information to be a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelabine NCC.
Her former leaders will be retreated because of last year ' s copayan turmoil.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
Now, NCK Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to siloviks.
Of the new lists, the “solved” human rights defender-president of the local commission, but one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber expelled him for unethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Voltage Commissions of Borchev consider it “the place for the Coast”.
The Defense of Tolokonica did not affect the Mordovia FNC, which is considered “powerful”, and only one human rights defender wanted to be added to the new body, and she did not even have documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolaiko Swanidze, told the RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he was dismayed by the situation in Moscow and Rostove-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the Council.
His OP colleague Paul Gusev said he voted in favour of the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the compilation of the lists of ONCs by the Under-Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIN Research Institute.
Grib told the RBC daily that it was not appropriate to share candidates for human rights defenders and forcesmen and disagreed that the chairpersons of the commissions had sufficient powers to impede the work of its members.
The mushroom does not foresee the outcome of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the revised version will be put to the vote in the next days.
Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 days of prison on Phuket Island for false claims that she had been attacked by a taxist, appealed and released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bemford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June for a false suit following a report by the Thai police that the local taxist had carried out an attack on the night of Sunday on 10 June, while the other two men held her.
However, the video surveillance cameras later found that she had safely returned to her hotel after she broke up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed that she fabricated that story.
Before the trial, it was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day imprisonment at the general prison centre in the outskirts of Phuketa, not the female adult prison.
She is the daughter of the former player of the Australian League, Peter Tanks, who applied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra for assistance to his daughter.
Tanks said in Sidney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of her daughter and was awaiting her return to Australia.
“It is obvious that it was an alarming time, but we hope that it will be safe to return home as soon as possible, ” said Tanks.
Bamford appealed his sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 batts.
According to the Australian reports, she has been on her leave in the Krabi area in southern Thailand at the present time.
The Thai legal sources reported that Bamford was currently represented by a local lawyer in Phouket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the court ' s sentence to two years and forced her to serve in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of the Australian tourgent Michelle Smith in Phouket, Thailand can also seek to rebuild its eroded tourist image, resulting in a justifiable sentence.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris to present his novel Eltischeva, translated into French.
Remember, it was his novel that became the finalist of four prizes: "Light Pole," "Russian Buker", "National Bestseller" and "Big Book."
Last year, the writer of the book was awarded an award from the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undeniable leader in the generation of the current thirtieth and forty-year-old prozaics.
Almost every publication of its rigid, modern - day narrative stories and narratives is a source of hot debate among critics of a variety of ways.
It can be argued that the articles gathered together on the prose and publication of Senchin, the reviews of his books and journal publications produce an interesting and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of the 2010s.
The debate on “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to the critic Sergei Chuprin, is largely the subject of what its participants understand under the word “literacy” as they see the present and the future not only of our verbality but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow most articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere to be included.
Analytical and review articles are generally provided in the reductions in the sections “Abazas ...”
