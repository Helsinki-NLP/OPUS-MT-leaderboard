Parliament does not support the amendment to freedom of Timoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, rejected an attempt to abolish the article under which the leader of the opposition, Julia Timoschenko, was convicted.
An amendment that would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister ' s prison was rejected during the second reading of the Bill on the Mitigation of Economic Offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years ' imprisonment for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was found to be inappropriate.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will consider Timoshenko ' s appeal in December.
Timothychenko claims that the sentence is the political venue of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspicious of prejudice.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to be ratified.
Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Qaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert without him the war ended.
It's time to determine the winners.
As a general rule, Islamists prevail in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of Shariah's customary law, which we have already heard of.
Libya will become a country without crime, as the penalty for theft is the cutting off of the hand.
Women may forget emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; etc.
Instead of a dictator, a society consisting of rival clan will be united by the Quran.
There will be a order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which is unlikely to wish.
In any event, our way of life is neither the only one of its kind nor the best and most likely to be approached, for example, to the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants have accepted assistance from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that NATO's attacks were not guided by the American general, but Allah, whose greatness they glorified after each strike.
And if Libya seeks winners, the West does not belong to them.
We participated in the shootings, the service of Islam, and our politicians removed the dictator, their political allies, without any assurance of the benefits.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to renounce the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, should not worry about the expulsion of the Cristonos.
Although without occupation, would the oil companies receive the black gold of Libya for almost an invaluable price?
And then the West will finally be able to screw up with unselfish protection of civil rights.
Unless the followers of Shariah put an end to this.
Starting a new wave of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe are currently focusing on investors.
The static storm was over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP data in 3 quarters.
As compared with the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, Germany and France showed growth.
Still, the debt market hits the record today.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurason countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have issued their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany ' s GDP grew by the expected 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted the data for the second quarter in which the cases were better than expected (0.3 per cent instead of original 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decrease of 0.1 per cent (initial information was expected to be stagnated).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, GDP was stagnant compared to the previous quarter, and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, this confirmed a tendency to slow down economic growth in a gradual manner.
The results were worse than predicted by analysts.
Key developments:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it was stagnant compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany ' s economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the Eurasona and the European Union showed an increase of 0.2 per cent compared to the previous quarter, which coincides with the analyst forecasts.
Greece ' s economy demonstrated a preliminary decline of 5.2 per cent.
The income of its 10-year bonds is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical mark.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium are beginning to face difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the income of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4 per cent.
In Germany, ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech Assembly was screened in the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1:0 and celebrate an unexpected 200 million prize.
The national team has successfully handled the most challenging task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful naked Peter Jirachek, they won with an account 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team had been happily able to maintain a significant advantage after the domestic response match and will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz monitored the match and produced a detailed report.
Practically nothing remarkable in the first time and great luck in the second.
The Czech national assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the great Chech; and the heroic Jericho; the winner of the 1:0 in Montenegro and the adventure of the European Championship.
The great defense of the Czech team allowed Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianović and Vucnić became the most unsuccessful pair of matches after the two magnificent opportunities were missed.
Brilliant Petra Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech national assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech soccer will earn about 200 million Czech kroner.
From the very first few minutes, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty in combining; the game was at the centre of the field for most of the time.
This also explains the absence of pressure from the host team at the first time, and further attacks on the line of defence were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have established a live shield around an atomic power plant in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme in the face of a possible attack by Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, a mob was followed by a mob of deaths both in the United States and in Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have established a live shield around the Isfahan Uranium enrichment factory.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country's nuclear programme at the expense of their own lives.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all indicated that Iran had not abandoned its efforts to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran has been discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Uranus enrichment factory was followed by a mob of deaths both in the United States and in Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at the maximum paralyzing of the Iranian nuclear programme, the objectives would be, according to the Israeli press, installations both in Isfahan and in Natanza, where uranium enrichment was carried out.
Children with obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are weighing more; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5 per cent suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children with obesity tend to come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
Once again, we see the importance of the environment and models of conduct associated with man for his or her healthy development.
For example, cobbas appear on tables of children with obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of children suffering from obesity ate for the meal of fry potato fri on the eve of an educational event called Obesity is not accidental.
Moreover, the families of children with obesity do not engage in sports, but most of the families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 per cent of the children were told that their parents were taking time for sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last school year, with nearly 900 elementary classes participating throughout Bohemia.
Obesity was not accidental for the second consecutive year, with the support of the Všeobecná zdravotni pojišovna and Unilever insurance company.
To date, over 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 to 8 grades have joined the project.
Good nutrition and sufficient sporting work are the main determinants of the rapidly increasing number of children suffering either from excessive weight or from obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said that they were eating five times a day, on a breakfast-recus-lunch-punch-winder, which is one of the indispensable conditions of proper nutrition,” says one of the findings of the study.
No lunch and no sausage in the evenings.
Experts warn that even relative aspects of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of the families of schoolchildren have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has separate breakfast.
The worst discovery is that in every tenth family, people don't have any breakfast at all.
Still, breakfast is the foundation of a proper daily diet.
The study found that hot food is more common in families with children affected by obesity.
Almost everyone, irrespective of weight, drinks sweet cooling drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly engage in sports, the figure declines more than twice as much to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were invited to form their own menus based on the proposed products and on their tastes and preferences.
“The meal of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 is far from ideal for healthy nutrition”.
Their favorite food includes a large number of martyrs, meats, and sweet foods.
“Specific alarm is the popularity of sweet cool drinks,” says the final part of the study.
As the main lunch meal, the pasta won a small - scale bird.
However, the children had little interest in beans, fish and vegetables.
Determined to a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also showed that children were willing to change their meals on the condition that they would be provided with information.
“Many participants in the research control team have shown a significant shift in the preferences towards healthy food when they filled out the questionnaire after the lecture is done with obesity,” says the outcome of the project.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cool drinks, more children prefer them just water.
In addition, as a major meal, children often observed birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet foods and bakings.
Stilist must also be a good psychologist, professors claim.
In the first article on stylist training, I made a reference to the amount of information in the introduction sessions.
I had no idea what was going on.
Lectures of three experts in this area; advice on the choice of clothing for non-standard figures; and seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Next, more.
The closer we are to the final examination, the more information and practical tasks we are looking forward to.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really full of information.
This time, with Alenka, director, (no man, of course,) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
One short neck, another with a babe without proper shape, weighs more than one.
The stylist must know how to narrow the broad shoulders, extend the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were advised how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopes, that is, more splendid breasts and thighs and narrow tales, and not wearing them too arrogantly.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and the thigh is so large that you can't pick up the skirt or the trousers, you should have at least one thing that you put in order.
You will obviously not regret your investments because perfectly sitting clothes are invaluable.
In the skirt you'll feel much better in order than in the one who's constantly driving, rolling, naking, etc.
Boys, on the other hand, may wear rubber clothing, application, folding or folding.
Given the abundance of such information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand.
Still, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we've got.
Each participant had to come up with two outs for any celebrity: day and night.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style of clothing and the type of figure.
I have to put on Mirandu Kerr, which you can know from Victoria's advertising campaigns.
I rejoice to myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spirs, Christina Aguiler, who has recently recovered tonne (would you mind that I am exaggerating), or even a young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut our clothes out of the magazines or find them online, print and process using graphic programs.
Mudbord -- so called the outcome of the work -- then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep the graphic composition of the style in mind.
The style is not merely clothing real people, but produces food pages in magazines (based on specific instructions, such as fashion bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Camenic told us.
But it was only Sunday.
Stylist Needs General Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, saturated with information on the type of figures, was reinvigorated by three guests, specialists in this field.
Stilist, Honza Poorna, fashion designer, Yakub Polanka; and fashionable photographer Ben Rench.
Yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a styleist should use that fact.
A good styleist can use one piece of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a coat-train can be typically worn over jeans and t-shirts like a coat; but it can also be worn on a naked body, without tears like a dress.
Another way is to roll a sleeve or lift a collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Hey, play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I appreciated most of the advice, "For your work you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them, 'Jakub told us.
Here I finally realized why we're dental all the definitions and rules that combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we're often seeing quite different things.
Not to mention the fashion show.
Ben, a photographer, I found out that the stylist's got to have more outfit than the number of photos he has to take.
So, for a fashion review on 10 pages (equivalent to ten instalments) I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that on the picture, clothing often looks and works together with others in a way that's different from the reality.
We must bear that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Subhurana confirmed that often image and style was half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have an amazing fiber, but her image and marketing turned her into a world star.
The treatment of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even known people often think that's too much (and believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something, or what they look like second time).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we should expect them to call us a different size than the one they really wear.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about some celebrity of the celebrity of the celebrity of the celebrity of the celibacy, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that the stylist was not sufficient to understand the fashion and to be able to get dressed.
Our work mainly consists of association with the people we wear; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them or to follow their views.
"If the manager requests you to examine her clothes and add some beautiful things, you cannot throw out the whole of her wardrobe, saying to her that her clothes are horrible."
"Look at least a few things you can commend, and suggest that you can wear with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the working bag should be specific.
It's the bag you tie around the waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as scissors, sticky rolls, or English benches, it should contain neurons (the neurons use them when they collect certain items, such as bags or hats), special tickets for the back tissue if the cloth is too large (the plates and similar items are prohibited because they are powdering clothing) or a set for sewing.
To get away from the lectures and to get some practical experience, we learned to make the right tips on our shoes.
Even during a studio survey, where the floor is smooth, the pods can be damaged, not to mention the street photographs.
And we've got a glue.
You don't have to touch the shoe with scissors so you don't screw them up.
This requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario commended my work.
The skills I have mentioned have not come to my senses.
It's just part of what we heard in part two of the weekend courses.
I'm beginning to realize that being a professional stylist is not so easy no matter what you say.
V Need for Speed: Running in America.
Overview
What should have been a careless walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and negligible mistakes.
The ambitions were to some extent satisfied, but that was not important because no one obviously wanted to do any work.
Before entering the new version with the subheading “Feed”, there were great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; the demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero comes out of the car and runs.
As it often happens to NFS, the result is a lot different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the general impression is that some unnecessary mistakes have been made in this series of games for several years.
So it's not really a mistake, it's an unexplainable Lens of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You become part of a story, the main hero, Jack, who solves some personal problems by engaging in an illegal race across America.
You go to a car on the western coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to get to New York first.
This design has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race is travelling along its own route, and individual stages are taking place in a different and interesting environment.
So there's no feeling that the game is going on all the time.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in previous parts of the series, some roads are enjoyable.
Still, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving the car through the desert, the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains are enjoyable.
Besides, the race sometimes revitalizes the unusual part.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, you need to be careful in the mountains to avoid falling under avalanche.
Individual races are pretty well streamlined.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a time, you're trying to chase a few rivals (in fact, a regular race); then you're trying to improve time (the standard race with a seconds); or you're competing with one opponent.
Among other things, you sometimes face the police, which further complicates your task.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack runs away from someone for most of the time and you have to help him by pushing buttons at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
It's amazing that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
It actually turns out that it's good for the game because it's not annoying; given the above, it's one of the things that make the game more interesting.
The racing model follows previous models.
This means that it no longer represents something special, but it cannot be considered a shortage.
If you're looking for a real life imitation, you're going to have to find another place.
Still, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic races, although better options can be found in the market.
So far, it's very good.
But after a while, problems begin.
Unlike driving, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect such a game to change and collision, but if you don't know what you're talking about before a clash with an object, what your car does, something's wrong.
Usually, while driving or passing by cars in a tight stream, you sometimes have a little touch on another car, but sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car starts freaking out.
Or it's broken.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to ruin the fun.
The restarts are arranged so that if you break or go far from the road, the game returns you to the point where it interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you're using them all, you're going to have to start a race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely entirely on it.
Sometimes you do not have enough restarting, and you have to make use of a separate part of the race.
The important lack of play is the fact that the same thing often happens in the same place.
For example, some turns need to be taken in a certain way, or you just won't get happier.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a specific location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your rival pass easily between two cars moving in the opposite direction, while when you get there, the cars are already positioned to either drive them or drop their speed.
It doesn't matter when you're next to them; everything's arranged that the situation always happens just in front of your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several locations where, regardless of time, the same rival is placing you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge, where you're going in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your rival must stand in front of you, no matter what.
The fact is, when he's in front of you, he's deteriorating your review, which leads to one or more accidents in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it starts to get upset.
It's a pity because despite the simple driving pattern, the game is so interesting and sometimes so intense that you don't have time to look at what's happening around you.
It doesn't matter what makes you miss -- the concept of fivety unique roads, the sequence of races, or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the race is unusual.
You need to track the gas stations on the road, because it is on them that your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports are suited to cities; powerful American cars are for direct cuts of highways; and exotic super-cutters for technical driving, for example, on bent-down mountain tracks.
The main mode of history mode is closely linked to the challenge mode mode; it is the racing of individual sites you learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal case both medals and glasses common to the regimes of challenges and story.
Many opportunities are available for higher driving, starting from cars and ending with profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the Autolog online function, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here is another gap that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the tunnel of the subway (to be sure) where you run the rails in the dark (to be sure).
Your spidometer shows the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (to be counted as yes) when suddenly the train of the subway flys on you, turning your car into a scrap metal.
For a few days, our edition has been discussing whether no one really thought at the time of creating a game, or whether its creators really think we're such an asshole.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video show is mostly pleasant, sometimes fascinating.
Although it is regrettable that, in some critical times, the quality of the record is declining, sometimes rather severe.
This is particularly true in the case of incidents with a large number of participants, where the good recording would not be particularly helpful.
The sound is fine; the soundtrek is for the amateur.
To please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrek has entered different styles; but few people will buy a game because of its music.
The general impression of Need for Speed: The escape is pretty unmanageable.
If the game avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that running is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, play leaves a feeling of incomplete.
Of course, it's a good fun, but prepare for the shortcomings that will blind you as a searchlight at the airport.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation of disfellowshippers and skeptics relative to the euro.
“The Treaty of Lisbon has caused considerable differences between individual organizations.”
"I didn't expect such a violent war."
“Five or six years before the situation stabilizes, it will calm down and all players will get used to their new roles”, Ambassador Milena Vizenov of the EU rigidly started his lecture at the Faculty of Law.
It has proved to be true of its “Light and Openly on Europe” in the first part of its lecture, where it described the individual EU agencies and their relationships as simple and clear that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law would be obsessed.
Moreover, Vizenov commended the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Wang Rompei:
"The critics said he was a regular gray office mouse, which cannot perform any role; I must say everyone was struck by how well he did his role."
"He is a man who can listen to the twenty-seven participating countries at the same time, is wonderful to communicate with them, and has a clear understanding of which side the EU needs to be developed."
She explained her new position as representative for international relations and security issues as the answer to the question, "Who is the European Union? What number should I call for?" as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union ' s policy towards such countries as China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
The focus was further on a programme key to the EU in the past, present and near future.
She referred to the success of the Czech presidency in the past year.
The Czech Republic had dealt with the current financial crisis; they had overcome the crisis and organized the East Partnership Summit.
She said that the resignation of the Government at that time was a negative phenomenon that had caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
At present, Czech representatives to the EU are very busy.
As the Ambassador said, both the Presidency and the subsequent financial crisis have led to the ongoing bloom.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the EU needs to be adopted, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget would be scarce and cost-effective, what areas would be preferred; which countries would receive greater support and which fewer; all these issues in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels, "O Europe, in Understanding."
"I really don't like the reductions, the foreign words and the jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people do not try to sell curves or round round rounds, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese classes.
It also intends to make better use of the EU environment and to attract more Czechs in European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe - Our Future
The Ambassador argues that the Czechs are considered to be Euro-sceptics; as well as people who are rather negative than positive.
She wanted more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
It believes that this is the responsibility of several factors: for example, the modestness of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful presidency of Czech Republic, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Wisefed Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we are joined by a dictionary, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, for what reason is the meeting again, the Vishegrad group?" and he's not happy at all."
In the future, Vizenova expects mostly new strict rules for the budget policy of States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea to be two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside of Eurasone."
"We have the Schengen Zone, and we already have the institution of enhanced cooperation."
“The first time it was said that the countries that want to be united should be united, whereas those who do not want to stay side by side.”
“The number of such institutions will increase; it will be really two-speed Europe” is awaiting Vizenov.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Romanpei in advancing the rule that all issues relating to the EU as a whole should be discussed by all participating countries, not only those in the EU.
Brand history:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that best expresses an IMB strategy, the most closest will probably be "long-term."
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid by her first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson Elder.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be solved easily if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumay!" thus became a stamp around which the life of the future giant was rotated (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
"To us in the IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because she remained faithful to her original values, although she was not afraid to change everything around her.
In our first hundred years, this has enabled us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care, just as Batya in the Czech Republic was one of the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms and a complex system of bonuses for best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Similarly, long-term relationships between IBM and consumers are advanced.
From the outset, the company has found a brilliant use of talented people, which was one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it a great choice.
Agreed with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan by which a woman, Virginia Rometti, would replace Palmisano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is now a director of sales, marketing and development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, in which many future innovations have emerged.
No wonder there are many ideas — about half a million people work in the company.
Organization with good reputation
The firm ' s strong position in the business is a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, from the point of view of the IBM concept, it was rather an organization, not a technology company,” said the Economist Professor Harvard Business School and author of the book on the IBM Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve technology-based business problems," adds Joge Colony from the Forrester Research Consulting Company.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Over a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of his logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It appears to be the most universal technology company - hardware and software development; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services - from servers to nanotechnology.
She owns the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of her employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, banking, bank map, financial swap, bar code and diskette.
From $220 billion, market capitalization data showed that IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first place, Apple), cheating Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look forward
Not all of her products were tasted by buyers and enrolled in the era, for example, IBM suffered a failure with its OS/2 operating system; prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is determined by the movement forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms -- if they don't work, it refuses them.
It's different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, which is based and undergoing falls on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
The main income of IBM is derived from services, and about one fifth in each case comes from computer software and hardware.
While in 1990, it was twice as small as its capital, it was the strongest producer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, and at the same time it has invested 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued investment even after 2008, when the current economic crisis was the first to hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment in the years of the Great Depression.
Until IBM seems to have damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM shares has increased by record 120 per cent; the net earnings of the company have continued to rise.
The IBM corporate motivation is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis arises, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM history: from cheese knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, its original name, "Corption, Tabulation, Records" was quite complicated.
She took the name IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for the offices of the company in Canada and South America.
The foundations for the future IBM were set up by the merger of four companies whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies, such as legendary "tabel watch", i.e. hours, fixing the time when staff members come and leave work.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlet Flint, a businessman who also chaired a board of trustees by 1930.
Flint hired the director of the competitor, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then put the founder of IBM in a shadow - Watson's ideas remain the base of an inevitable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as clearly from the name, began with the production and sale of various equipment for business - from cheese knives and meat cuts to cash machines.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, the benefit doubled to $9 million, and a massive expansion of the company to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his seat in the director's chair took his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In the 1960s, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA to control space flights -- Mercury, Saturn and 1969 -- to man's flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family, IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, IBM 5150, was found in the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers by the Chinese company Lenovo, while buying the Practical WaterhouseCoopers Consulting Office, which focused fully on consulting and high value added services.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great progress in its Smarter Planet concept.
Its objective is to use technology in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve road and urban governance.
In the area of commerce, IBM has recently presented the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businesses to control the entire trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country simultaneously in central and eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is located in Prague, where the world level research team is also working to recognize speech.
Richtargeva about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, leave me a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzeva (53) said it's over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtarge (53), became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosov (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
Nevertheless, she no longer wants to wait, and she has defined clear rules for her future life.
"The Pepa can come home, but it's no longer like my partner," explained Richtarzew.
When Darina Richtarzeva gave Bartoshaw’s bed in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she forced Ivette to leave Rzychan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he confessed publicly that he loved her.
After a while, Darina surrendered, pretending to have complied with her husband's novelty; and now she finally forgave him.
I don't care who his wife's sleeping with.
Even if Richtarge and Bartosowa are ever to break up, his wife won't take him with his hugs.
"He's my sons' biological father, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out."
"So he'll end his days, not like my beloved, lost and found old fool, but the man who binds me with," said Richtarzev, adding that she's already freed from her husband and insists only on mutual addictions.
As long as Joseph has nothing to do with what his wife rejected him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Eve, I'm not going to change this."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our alliance is still in operation; I'm responsible for repairing, gardening, house and sping."
"Darina and I are communicating perfectly well, only we don't share bed anymore," said Richtarge Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richtarzewah finds a new love, he won't interfere with her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I'm in love with Iveta and I'm in full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
Worst women's habits: Do they touch you?
When you ask men to call out some typical women's bad habits, they usually list them all right away.
Dear ladies, do you find yourself in the next lines describing a few women's habits that make men angry?
Spring
Is your second half complaining that you're always shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping on big sales?
If so, your sping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their passion for spinning.
Still, who of you will refuse to walk around the clothes shops in search of perfectly sitting clothes and illustrations of them (who would like to be in different colors) in the illustrations?
Chopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it might be a hell.
Just remember how many times you told your second half to wait outside...
Continuing resentment
"I'm too fat?"
"I have to drop at least five kilograms, maybe I'm going to start making a gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracting me?"
Do you know those phrases?
Yeah?
Then you are part of a group of women who are inhibited by their appearance.
Not that you need to stop watching yourself, but many men literally have an allergic reaction to the regular complaints of a partner’s appearance.
The strong sex also agrees that the more complaints are raised, the more women are irritating them.
The Most Important Order and Cleanness
It's like an endless story.
Myka's ceilings, dust cleaning, sex washing, dusting, bathing, at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming on a clean kafel in dirty boots; children for mud in a clean shell and fingerprints on a window glass in a living room that was so hard to clean?
If you are suffering from this “deviation”, try to realize that being extremes is not good; and that your family should not have the order and the cleanness of the family.
A harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships as well as the whole family.
Determined to Command
"Put your laundry in the basket."
"You gonna wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Small towels shouldn't lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your mate several times a day, it may be very naive.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood it, women wouldn't have had to command them so often...
Songs
Some women like to gossip, insult, and intrigue against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, and why.
From time to time, I guess each of us has gossip.
We'll be frank, that's the nature of all women.
Anyway, there are more serious gossipers, women who often gossip and despise others, especially in a women's working group, who pose a great threat to their environment.
Results of Yagra and Vorchoka have helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers of the Hokqueyajr Yaromir Yagra helped Philadelphia win the 5:3 on the Carolina ice and again became the most effective Czech player in the match.
In both cases, Claude Gira used the experience of a thirtieth-year-old star; he added another transfer and was declared the best match player.
Two successful match transfers also belonged to a team with Yagrem Yakub Vorachek.
After the Yagre match, he told foreign journalists that he had predicted to Gira a great night.
"I told him before the match he'd kill the Hit Trik."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," explained Jag, after whose actions Girus killed his head at the first opportunity Flaires gave.
A little later, the second leg of the team also had the Czech trail.
The Harriquenz Vorcatche was caught by a chaiboy and handed it over to Maxim Talbot, who killed it between the circles.
One second before the first break, the home player Patrick Dwyer reduced the gap to a large advantage, but at the beginning of the second time, Flyers again took over.
Especially Jehu.
After the Iagra was put to death the third head; in the future, he was transformed into the fourth head of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best league player, but he's definitely in the three of the best," said Jag, commending his center.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play with a hokquee player like him."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my teammates have tried to help me, and now my turn has come," added the Jag.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rutu and the Dwyer toolbars, reducing the gap to one naked.
Further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger's been fine in our area."
"He hit the chimney, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far edge."
"I was aiming at him, and I'm glad it worked," he described his impression from the last naked match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the Eastern Conference.
The guard of Monreal ceh Yaroslav Spachk did not complete a match with Buffalo; he left the game during the second period because of the injury of the upper body.
With an experienced defender, Canada lost its two-fold advantage and lost 2:3 after the toolbar series.
Tomas Plecans couldn't kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the coach was saddened by a large number of injuries in the back because the match ended with only five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We ended the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people."
"No matter what, we can't do anything about it, we just need to accept it," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the chabou out of our zone."
"What was our weak side," added the counselor P.K. Subban
After 30 attacks, the Czech Halkper Onjah Pavelz helped Winnipegs defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Golas Jets, who interrupted the fivefold series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Trends in travel prices since 1989
Prior to 1989, only five government tourism agencies could work in the former Czechoslovakia: žedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since travel to the West was severely limited, tourists at that time mainly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, Czech tourists travelled to the German Democratic Republic for holidays; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Krym on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (either country on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Baladon).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, resulting in considerable restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual visits to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go by himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was needed from that country; it was not possible to travel individually.
At the time, tourism agencies offered to travel to the West, but they had to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have good friends in the agency.
And that was not all.
Currency permits were needed to travel to the West, not to be issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely converted; without currency permit it was impossible to obtain funds (western currencies) for travel to the West.
Most of the Czechs had spent their vacations at home, leading to a large number of cottages and summer homes, and this habit has continued to this day.
Since 1989, tourism in Czech Republic has thus experienced the present revolution.
While before 1989 the GDR or Bulgarian leave was the culmination of our trips, the Czechs held 4.5 million leaves in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that until 1989, we were unable to visit Croatia, the most popular of all, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need to obtain a visa to neighbouring Western European countries had been lifted, leading to a huge wave of short journeys, mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get rid of the West, and everyone wanted to go there for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents because their income at that time was not enough for a hotel or boarding room.
A typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring its own food (conservations, salts, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a free-converted Czech crown, and after decades, our tourists are finally able to buy a western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important situation about 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, there was no need for visas to visit virtually all developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys even easier.
The next significant event in the history of the post- revolution took place in 2000, with a great demand leading to the historic first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have brought Czech to the warm exotic countries, with 12 exotic flights from the Czech Republic in the winter.
Currently, about 100,000 Czechs are visiting exotic countries every year!
Another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain visas for Czech tourists, and our country thus joined the most developed world countries forever.
For the first time in history, in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their leaves abroad (50.3 per cent); for the first time in history, they spent over 15,000 kroner per person for leave abroad, including their costs at destination.
The General Assembly must choose the President, the threat of the Pat is back.
For about five months, there was no President of Czech football, and there is the risk that successor Ivan Gaschek, head of the Czech soccer association (FAHR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on the rules of the elections.
Without that, there will be no beginning of a vote for one of the three candidates.
Jindrzych Rychl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are thirsty to lead Czech football.
Gasek left his post in June, leaving, he called on his colleagues to join and find a strong identity that would lead football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Gascheka age has reloaded soccer between the two chambers of an association that cannot choose a single candidate.
This became very clear on 16 September when a new President had to be elected.
Members of the General Assembly had not been able to arrive at the National House in Prague, Smikhs, since negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote in the general assembly, only lawful representatives or also officials to whom the credentials had been granted.
This period has since been partially settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Rights that representation based on credentials is not possible.
Disputes on the rules of the elections, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help too much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was largely engaged in this issue.
Views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is: how can we move to the 3rd round and avoid the Pat?
“The argument is whether to follow the standards or to find another model”, says one of the Vice-Presidents of FAHR Dushan Freedom, who represents professional football at the Association Authority.
Based on the model provided for by the Charter, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received much support from the Chamber from which he is nominated.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to compromise to be the winner of the election of the candidate with the largest number of voters in both Chambers.
The Czech side insists on the assumption that, in a general percentage ratio, the winner shall obtain at least two thirds of the votes.
“Although, the two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; this would have totally rejected the concept of the two Chambers”, Freedom agreed with the arguments of Moravia, and he said that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing rules.
A few unexpectedly, Tomas Pazlik agrees with his opinion, although it is estimated that the rules of the elections set out by the statute set up the Pelta more than other candidates.
"I'd like the elections to pass as much as possible by the statute."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representative foolishness as in the previous general assembly," says Victoria Plsen, who is the first candidate; and in his remarks he basically contradicted Pelte.
The pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new President would be known in Nimburg; he also hoped that in the future candidates would cooperate constructively.
“Every emotional drowsing will calm down after today's expected release of a national assembly at the European Championship.”
“Futball will be happy again, people will be more willing to cooperate,” said the representative of Iblanica, and of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both the professional and the regional levels.
Rachel's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous."
"It's not between Bohemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to deliberately adapt the rules."
"This can cause another break in the general assembly."
"I hope that healthy meaning will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual talks have been held directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
The additional flight, which was to be carried, among other things, to the Vice-Presidents of Daliber Kucher and Rykhla to the Podgorica, did not fly out of Prague in the morning because of technical failure, and sought an alternative to bring the part of the executive committee to the place of the winning match.
Eventually, a ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be crucial.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobesh, would like the opponents of the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
Much is at stake: government subsidies; creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ‰STV with the new direction of Czech sport following the financial problems of Sazki.
Patzlik is in the presidential struggle because he doesn't see a suitable candidate.
If before the Extraordinary General Assembly, the head of the soccerists, Plzen Tomas Pazlik, saw a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements for the President of the Futball Association of the Czech Republic (FARR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If I had been a dignified candidate, I would have fought for him and I wouldn't take part in the fight."
"But such a man hasn't been found yet," said Patzlik αTK.
The motivation of Patzlik to fight Miroslav Pelta and Jindrzhich Reich to try to prevent Pelte, the alleged favourite of the elections, from entering FAHR.
Moreover, Patzlik stresses that in the event of victory, he will remain President only until 2013 when another general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to take up an experienced top manager, not too tied to soccer life.
"I talked to a few people that could be meant."
"To me it was terrible to hear some of them say they don't even want to be connected to Czech football at the moment."
"I'd like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, Patzlik and Pelta are the main controversies associated with the relationship between the latter and Roman Berbra, President of the regional soccer association in Plzen. Berb is a person of controversial reputation, known behind the streets as an influential lobby, capable of influencing the voices of delegates of the general assembly.
Patzlik thus finds it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged, and soccer will not move forward."
"With the support of Berb, a capable businessman, that would be even more harmful to football," said Patzlik.
He suggests that, a few years ago, the name of Pelta was recorded during the hearing of the telephones in the corruption case; Pelte has succeeded in avoiding the sentence.
"I don't know the prestige of Pelta's victory would bring football."
"And what we would look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Patzlik, no longer mentioning his previous statement that he would "sell a club of Pelta if he became President."
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelt in the future.
This is shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Patzlik supported before the general congregation in September, which ended with a fiasco.
"He would be the first one to whom I would call."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it in the head of the assembly."
"But he can't control the association."
"Now I don't slack my nose in what I don't know," said Patzlik, who attracted a lot of attention in September, when he supported the removal of a judicial brigade headed by Lucék Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Patzlik claims he'll risk controlling the association.
He refers to his experience in the management of private companies; since last summer, he has run a team of Plzen, which, with his help, celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the soccer environment change, to support her changes to the best."
“To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to abhorrent situations,” said Patzlik, and he did not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinsky.
One of its priorities will be the strengthening of the relationship between the Czech Olympic Committee, with the assistance of which it will lobby at the highest political level the allocation of more money for sports from lottery fees.
"It's one of the key points that the new President has to do."
"If taxes are taxed on gambling, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
Patzlik does not believe that his relationship with the Plzen Club is a burden, although he claims that the President of FARR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Yablonian, and Reichl's with the Prague Douche.
"It's not a perfect option."
"And yet I don't see any sense in the hypocritical transfer of my pills club to someone else, once I'm going to go back there in six months," says Patzlik.
Pelta promised new rules of FARR that would avoid the Electoral Pata
Two days before the general soccer association, one of the candidates for the President, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was chosen, he would fight for the new FARR rules to avoid disputes over the rules of election in the future.
Prior to the negotiations on Thursday in Nimburg, the Yablonica function remains an optimist and believes that the attention paid by the electoral struggle will greatly detract from today's expected success of our soccer assembly.
Prior to the September elections, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus both on representation and on obtaining funding.
He decided to participate in the elections at the last moment in front of the last general assembly. a two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his idea of football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"They feel that it's time for someone to lead the association," asserts a person primarily associated with the Yabloni club; but he's spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the association.
That gives him reason to assume that he's experienced enough to run Czech football.
He believes that the present problems are caused by the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Gaschek.
"Alas, the rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If the different modes of representation had not been adopted, we would have already had the President since September," said Pelta.
He referred to the census of the key civil association document as a false purpose for delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as my personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails."
"This is a fundamental question without which we can't exist," claims Pelta.
In addition, he says he's not trying to stand out in the background of the rivals.
In the past, he had stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindrzikh Rykhl, whom he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware that his opposing candidate should become his first Vice-President.
For a long time, he had not attacked Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in soccer for more than a year, and he's made some success."
“Whatever the case, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his pre-election campaign.”
"Everything is why some of them now question his true identity," said Pelta about their competitor, and Pelta himself claims to be true to the declarations that he announced in September.
It considers its main weapon the knowledge of football, from competition at the lowest level to national assembly.
The national assembly must represent the whole football.
"I would also try to end all incidents, beginning with the case of the Bohemians or the consequences of last year's corruption scandal."
“I would immediately focus on negotiations with both the private and the public sectors to guarantee enough money for all football,” said the 40-year-old candidate two months ago.
He then promised that his election to a soccer head would not lead to the dismissal of the staff.
"I'll need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." It was his message to the Insurance where the protracted period of interstate was a clear nerve.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios associated with the planned general congregation, he believed that delegates would come to Nimburg on Thursday in vain.
"If the only controversial question is how to hold the elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
"Futbola needs the trust he can obtain, only by finally choosing his leader," says Pelta, who, two days before the key day of his career, remains an optimist.
Rachel promises that he will act actively in his leadership.
If the meeting on Thursday, Jindrzh Rychl, the vice president, became President of the Czech soccer association, many people in the Association would be dissatisfied.
Rachel promises that if he is chosen, the time of hard work will come.
He wanted to establish changes in the system and made the executive committee responsible for selected areas in soccer.
He also promises to address the problem of the Bohemians; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money to football; and to continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashek.
"As a president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole."
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national assembly, professional soccer and soccer activities for youth”.
"Then I don't want to say I'll do it myself," said Rychle in his interview for the TK.
"I'm a commander, and I want to allocate powers to the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area."
"I'm going to give you the task so that in each of these segments, soccer moves a lot forward."
"It probably won't like many people, because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement allegedly caused him to doubt his candidacy.
"Oh, I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know whether there is any meaning in this; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put my sticks in my wheels and question my every step," he explained his doubts.
"Although, many people told me I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"It's a trust I can't abandon," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gaschek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to override all of this."
"There were processes that could produce results in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be selected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Hashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelta is unlikely to be competent."
"He's surrounded by people who would be doing soccer so that he can only be available to the chosen ones."
"It's a lot of accusation to me, but it's definitely not a subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make soccer accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he denounces the charges that he will only be the President of Czech Republic.
"While many people are trying to claim the opposite, I'm planning to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, the time has come to think about the division of the second League into the Czech and Moravian side, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"It will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moral teams in the League, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," said Rachel.
While Plsenzen Tomas Patzlik, president of the presidential struggle, Rachel is not daring to assess his chances of winning.
“I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me as my vice president, and I see that I have made some obvious achievements,” said Rychl, and to his success, he attributes the savings of tens of millions of crowns on unfavourable contracts, television contract negotiations and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he is partially guilty of the lack of unity in the association.
Affirming that Pelta was “excluded from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football”, he considers another rival, Patzlik, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Plzene this year."
“If he is chosen, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Gaskek started without significant human changes in the committees.”
"He wouldn't distort facts for his benefit," said Rachel about his rival.

Children's basins with universal fibre optics and status basins in Budapest can test the incredible water of Europe - and relax the stagnant body in jakuza after a tour of town or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder had been able to do during her research trips for the past six and a half years: without her bathing suit.
Leaning on her back in the water, she looked up at the tasted domes, sailed to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the basin and admired carefully restored swimming basins in aerno-style.
She hastened to add each favorite basin to her notebook with important details about building and the history of the building.
The historian of the Meder Architecture examined more than 200 swimming basins - and now gathered impressions in her recently published book Ba dedereuden (Boot Party), where everything came from the public basins in Munich to the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and the “functional concrete buildings” in Towns.
Its “travel to the most unusual baths in Central Europe” was conducted through 13 countries, in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and visited the bathalins in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a real enthusiast of the bulk culture.
She's very little enthusiasm for sports, says Mader, but in water everything is different.
The only deficiency is that swimming worshipers must tolerate the blue calf and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the attractive smell of dry forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"One time I asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so horrible," says a living in Vienna Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the sauna oils are a health factor in the bathrooms, because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulating.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure to the eyes if the builders take on such work.
"The surface is very transparent but also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All visually reflected: high ceilings, color tiles and temples.
The illustrated Bathing Radio on 190 pages provides valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of health oasiss - and makes you want to jump into the water.
The Meder collector found several outstanding copies during the Hungarian study.
It found abundant nitrate water in the Carste Cave (The Pearl Bath in Mischolt-Tapolz) and the thermal bath filled with luxury water in a building built in the form of a bottle (Városi Termalfürdö in Yasbrín) as well as excellent therapeutic bathings, such as the 100-year-old Scenenas in Budapest.
Of many heated open basins in Switzerland and Austria, there's an amazing sight, and you can see all of Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or view the snowed Arlberg from the open basin in St. Anton, and there's a vapour window that allows you to see what's happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design is expected by the bathers in Langenfeld, and the Aqua-Academ in Etztal looks like the NFO, just landing in the Alps.
In winter, couples of three open shells rise from it, seemingly small in the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in Schwarzwald
Meder basin collector did not meet the smell of chlorine in every pool.
A lot of thermal baths smell like sulfur, and the Arpad's name's bath in Bekeschab is so much smelling of oil that you can hardly believe you're in a health source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbonates in liquid water, and the water is almost black from the ila that is sticking to the skin as soon as you get into the basin is a healthful experience of a particular type.
Iris Meder, however, was disappointed at some point in her search for beautiful bathing places, and when she tried to visit the Czech baths in the Lugachovicas, she found that the territory was sealed.
The Kubalins, designed by the architect Dushan Jurković in 1902, were closed.
When the Meder looked into the red-white-glass window, she saw the weeds growing between the calves.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by hot footprints is the amazing swimming basin in Schwarzwald, the Palais des thermal waters in Bad Wildbad.
You will find not only the neo-romanic elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra Hall, which was added in about 1900.
After thoroughly reconstructed in 1995, the Termal Palace, the favorite swimming pool of Iris Meder basin, was not only because it was from Schwartzwald.
"This is a real achievement, so skillful to combine such different architectural styles," says Meder.
To dig into a thermal basin in such a palace is a definitely secondary exercise.
Speculation of agricultural products
The Bank is investigating agricultural trade.
Christian Tives
Will the Bank stop the trade in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director is planning to make changes in January.
Hamburg--
For German citizens, the situation is clear: according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans are considered inadmissible that banks are speculating agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study carried out by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa by the organization of Foodwatch consumers.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Shuman, demonstrates that the game at world commodity exchange rates raises prices -- and the banks are thus involved in world hunger.
The campaign of consumer defenders is directed directly against the head of the Bank of Doiche, Joseph Ackermann, although large banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade in the same way.
Initially, the rates for goods were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any event, most experts now agree that players have renounced the rules of supply and demand - and are profitable from the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism and promised to investigate the accusations and said that no trade was “not worth risking the good reputation of Doiche Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be presented to the Board of Directors of the Bank, with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank will then announce the changes that will be followed by the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decline or end completely.
Accermann's working on his image.
President Foodwatch Tilo Bode was pleased with the news by stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. “Stacks of growing food prices are a stimulating example of how foolish banks are now acting against common interests”.
As the bank's chief lobbist, Ackermann has a certain responsibility, in Bode's opinion.
"The Bank must remove from the portfolio all the investments that make the money rates for food prices," said Bode.
“It doesn't matter whether it's about hungry people or the reputation of Doiche Bank.”
Accermann's quick reaction first starts to surprise, but the Director would like to have an inviolable image only a few months before he ends his office.
The Bank announced on Monday that the President would not move to the Monitoring Board, as planned.
The revocation of disputed speculation on the food market could improve its image.
Nor is it practically necessary to care for the costs, with the consequences of dealing with his successor.
Each other would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, a study was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa on 7 and 8 November, and 1001 participants participated.
No more than eleven per cent believe that the investments making the food price rate are acceptable to the Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade, and according to the study, each other would withdraw the contributions that ultimately lead to the speculation of goods.
43 per cent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 per cent said that they would think of closing the account and going to another bank.
21st Century in Vienna
Pavilion is new.
Ingeborg Winsowsky
Architecture history with prizes, falls, and happy ends. Austrian Pavilion for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels has won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, deserted and abandoned.
Now it's reopened as a exhibition center.
The pavilion of Austria, designed by Carl Schwanzer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of the modern postwar architecture with its simple forms, glass lounges, bold expressions of belief in technical progress.
Pavilion Schwanzera conquered Gran Pré on architecture in 1958 for his light varieties of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so known that he also built an Austrian pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
Eventually, he was glorified throughout the world in 1973 by his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister, a cup-shaped building.
Pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building, was transferred to the Swiss Garden near the South Valley of Vienna, transformed and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - and often referred to as the 20th Century House for that reason.
Whatever the case, the building was not suitable for the Museum for technical and spatial reasons -- there were no walls on which art could be hanged, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house has been deserted since 2001, and its condition has grown worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Kryshanitz has now reinstated the pavilion, called the 21st Century House, and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum's office, which will open the first exhibit on Tuesday night, in all its senses, a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvetter Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Huslan-Arko, a graduate of the Art History Faculty, with a brilliant career figure in youth, who worked in Sotheby's, the Hussei Museum of Guggenheim and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernness in Salzburg, persuaded politicians and guardians to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided how the building would be used.
The new museum was to include a permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votroba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern arts, and also a office building was to be built.
Strong controls & limited budget
Kryshanitz was the ideal candidate for the project at that time.
He was known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession, Joseph Olbrich, and won the contest, but he also studied at Schwantzer at the University of Technology, and the pavilion was an “excellent place” for him, where he visited exhibitions “once every week”.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks ahead of the building, a building that had lost part of its greatness and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose in the last reorganization were much more serious, and the building was a “energy absorber”, says Kryshanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, the glass was inserted with a secure glass, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strong, secure glass.
Steel translations of the heat bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos were removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, and the burning well between the building and the streets provided light - a virtually new building, but still elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated into an old red-rooted protection against corrosion.
Hall of movie theater is the same as it used to be.
All of this is under strict museum control and with limited budgets.
"We've often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by museum administration," says Kryshanitz, pointing to an unequal moisture in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite limitations, problems and transformation.
Kryshanitz recently noticed that the pavilion from Brussels was rough - typical story of "copli in town."
Such an architecture "not at all" and still wants to "stimulate real awareness."
The home of the 21st century is in a very proper place, as the planning of the city has resulted in unexpected luck, and the fully reconstructed headquarters quartal with offices and housing property is growing around the Swiss garden.
The 21st-century home may be a second happy event, and it may be complemented by the second building of Kryshanitz, the French collector von Gabsburg has acquired the Interim Berlin Exhibition Hall and is reported to have negotiated with the city about its neighbourhood in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion-million-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn promulgated an anti-crisis plan to avoid abolition of trains in winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
Expenses will amount to millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year to avoid winter revocation and lateness of trains.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn ' s internal anti-crisis plan, the Bild reports that by 2015 investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned.
Investments are intended to improve the capacity of locomotives and the railway network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of staff members involved in snow cleaning from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The aim is to clear the platforms from snow and ice before the start of work and 90 per cent of the necessary arrows within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancelling and late trains in the winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
During the winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it lacked reserves when weather conditions deteriorated.
Many new regional trains were awaiting the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays in filing ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check for many years the ICE axes much more frequently after one of the ICE trains had broken an axle at the main station in Cologne.
Douche Bank will pay many million pounds of fines in the United States
New troubles came after the turmoils surrounding Josef Ackermann, Director-General of Doiche Bank: Doiche Bank threatens a U.S. fine in many millions of pounds of sterlings.
It was as if the Bank had little problems in the country, the past industrial giant in the United States had now overturned it, and the Bank with headquarters in Frankfurt would pay $145 million (106 million euro) to alleviate the disputes that had arisen since bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem was about the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of their use of false promises to tempt credit unions to buy their financial products.
The cost of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are glad that we have solved this problem without the parties to the court”, said the representative of the Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not accept its guilt.
The same is true for the Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
The National Office of Credit Unions (NCUA) is responsible for US credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is struggling to compensate for losses that come out of billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and in the summer initiated a case against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The doubtful mortgage bonds are the so-called securities provided by the mortgage pool.
They are supported by domestic loans.
This decided the destiny of a number of financial companies when they dropped the bubble in the United States real estate market in 2007.
The American Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers, ordered a long life in September 2008 on the dam of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have raised a large number of claims in order to pay compensation or punish fraudulents.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is behind the largest wave of claims.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having acquired bail agreements from American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for about $200 billion.
The Bank is also in danger of prosecuting FHFA for numerous agreements with a total of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires the bank with headquarters in Frankfurt to assume responsibility for “existent losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
The Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and indicated its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffet invests 10 billion in IBM.
The financial guru Buffet is actively investing in IBM.
Since March, he had purchased more than ten billion dollars in stock.
To date, the largest United States investor, Warren Buffet, has always stated that he has not invested in computers and IT, as their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report IBM had changed his view of investments to this industry.
According to Buffett, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for IT for departments of other companies.
In the financial world, the investments of Warren Buffett have been regarded as a rival act.
IBM, IT veteran, now got the name "Sir IBM."
In an interview with the American Business Canal, CNBC Buffet reported that he had acquired an IBM stock of $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment Holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even the IBM had not known anything before recently about his participation.
He commended the management that had been successful in making profits even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffet, referring to the management strategy.
The long time of the IBM was focused on high-income IT services, such as the date-centres.
The computer industry, now over 100 years old, has also offered software and advisory services, as well as powerful business computers.
Buffet has so far avoided technological companies.
He argued that he was only investing in those companies whose business he understood.
and invested, for example, in rail freight, lubricants and engineering.
Its Berkshire Hathaway has shares in the long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (former Münchener Rück), together with some 80 of its own daughter companies.
81-year-old Berkshire Hathaway had acquired a small textile company in the 1960s and had built one of the world's most expensive companies on its basis through skilled investments.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest,
Making it a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct in making money brought him the name "Oracula from Omahi."
The share price of IBM increased by one per cent before the opening of the markets after the Buffet investment was announced.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, is worth over 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world, along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffet, however, said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder, Bill Gates, is his close friend.
Immediate danger
Following the detection of a “Keeki in Cvikkau”, Turkish media questioned the power of the law in Germany.
One newspaper speaks of blood ideology, which now rises again on the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessmen between 2000 and 2006 were the result of the right extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have been the response to this communication in Turkey and the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has led to long-standing fears, such as law-extremist attacks on Turks since the mellion firings in November 1992 and Zolingen in May 1993.
There was no doubt, however, that xenophobia existed in Germany.
However, the right-wing network that has now been discovered has a scale that is not yet fully comprehensible.
"The birth of blood ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Haberturk newspaper.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of secret services and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in the right-wing extremist moor.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, refusing the victims of racial hatred with a silent peak in front of the Brandenburg gate on those weekends.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Community of Berlin held a ceremony involving German and Turkish politicians to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkey bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light, as a history of success.
Some Turkish media education was like a plaque. "Germany's 50th Anniversary" is the title of a Turkish Internet portal "Haber X" commenting on the circumstances of a series of murders.
The German edition of Hürriyet did not miss the occasion for this parallel.
"It starts to smell bad" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He notes that people who have paid taxes and their work have made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany have been killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful raid have been severely criticized by German-Turkish Internet operations.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not previously thought of monitoring suspicious persons in the right-wing circles.
Some authors have reached a rather sharp rhetoric. “If they continue to act in the same manner, migrants will have no other choice than armed self-defence.”
"It'll be the best self-defence."
"The world in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network will be hidden and on the rightfulness of punishment," says Selen.
Crimes in Melle and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat to peace in Germany.
Photographs of burned ruins in Zolingen were deeply impressed by Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown the Turks who live here so clearly that they are at risk and the Germans that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, have increased the sense of unity of the Turks.
Do Not Repeat the Past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failures of the German police following the attacks, and Helmut Col refused to visit the survivors in Mellene.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burns in Zolingen, but his participation in the memorial ceremony in Kelna was received by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel, in his speech, to calculate the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
As if he had defined the value of a person by the taxes he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks to the current German State has deepened since then.
It was clear that there was a need to be done now, in addition to the identification and reassessment of the legal extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on the Lake Zurich
Most of the leading risky policies of European banks are not in France or Italy but in Switzerland.
UBS has barely been mistreated during the financial crisis, and since then it has been an uninterrupted struggle with one or the other crisis.
Now the German has to get him back to the right course.
Alex Weber certainly didn't know he'd get that part.
In July, after his effective departure from the office of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 it would begin to serve as an equally effective chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss Bank of UBS; an unexpected and profitable career.
Alex Weber was obviously fascinated, commended Switzerland for her beauty, the UBS for its renewed strength and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to make a difference."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Philiger and Oswald Grubel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be different.
The UBS Trader in London has cheated on bank security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The Executive Director of UBS, Oswald Grubely, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the president of the UBS board has been considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally come to his office?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank stated on Tuesday, he would be chaired by the Council in May and not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of the economy and specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will no doubt need time to adapt.
He suddenly became responsible for the bank's strategy, which once again proved that he's long deserved to be called "the biggest bank scandal in Europe."
UBS, on the one hand, is very large -- until recently, it's been managing the largest assets in the world -- and on the other, it doesn't come out of scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank does not spare anything.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The Bank has aligned the image of a hidden and sustainable, while at the same time a slender asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more wealthy customers than any other bank in the world,
As an investment bank, the largest banks of the world have entered the league.
It was impressive.
Hans Heiger, a former banker and a banking professor who has long been a teacher at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains, "I have always brought UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"Knowing what we know now, you might ask how I could make this mistake."
He was really mistaken.
It was only in 2007 that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffley's executive director, who was considered to be an outstanding intellectual and to the same extent a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to assume why he left.
The bank ' s investment unit attempted to play substandard securities and had to write down billions.
Believe you don't want to, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs in order to cope with the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors -- but investors whose services many bankers have recently politely refused -- one very untransparent Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund that is hidden to the point that even its name has not been reported.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to announce the new billion losses, and the chairman of the board of directors, Marcel Ospel, the second salary level of the Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, a catastrophe arose, and owing to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, the UBS was at risk of collapse and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic securities for an unnamed number of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for converted bonds with mandatory converts to become bank owners.
Switzerland was shocked: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks had settled in a small country.
Finally, the UBS final balance in 2007 was five times higher than the total production of Switzerland (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says the bank analyst Geiger.
The second catastrophe came shortly after the first.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in a tax dispute with the United States and said that he was ready to transmit data to wealthy customers who might have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of compensation for unjustified business revenues plus fines.
The UBS thus recognized that it was a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always his advantage in the fight for rich customers, a key to secrecy.
Thereafter, the Swiss banking secret was not the same as before.
The Executive Director and the President of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
It's starting to produce customers' money.
In several months, the bank has lost its confidence in both main areas of its activities - investments due to failure in speculation and asset management as a result of aid and tax evasion.
And it just calmed down and it began to seem that the UBS was able to solve the situation, as the affair with an affiliate-trider occurred, and the single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
"The incident from Adoboli has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Jansen, professor of economy and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks also doubts, “The UBS problem is that it has no risk control tool”.
It is the precaution that has long made Swiss bankers the world's largest assets - not an unnecessary risk, but the security of money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine Republic or not.
The safes of Swiss banks have become a symbol of irresistible reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the delicate taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still corresponds to the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Her position is classic.
The bank's main office is located in Zurich in Banhofstrass, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, surrounding the snowcapped chips of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rent rates are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss stores like Confiserie Sprüngli, there are such jewelry firms as Tiffany's.
The Swiss banks were located here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the palace of Credie Suiss and elite private banks, such as Julius Bar.
A heavy door leads to the UBS Lobby.
There are large leather sofas along the walls covered by the marble, alongside the emblem bank, a large Saif index.
UBS knows what his clients need, is reliability.
But both of the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned Swiss notions of banking -- or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the paper -- like all the Swiss bankers, he's collaborating with the two largest banks.
He believes that the UBS has become too large, particularly in an investment banking, where the Anglosaxes are very active.
In his view, the Swiss had nothing to add here.
"And if there is anything, then they've adapted for a long time to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it's the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS, brought him the first big profits -- and then the fiasco -- and no other European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became evident on 15 October 2008.
“In that environment, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million made the largest lifesaving operation in the history of the country,” writes Lucas Hesig in his book The UBS Crashe.
Politicians approved the provision of SwF 68 billion (about Euro45 billion) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have been before?
If they ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined one large group in June 1998.
A bank has been established that was too large for little Switzerland at the time of merger, and a bank that has continued to grow.
It was also helpful that two UBS banks were complementary, one was a rich but advanced bank specialized in Zurich for asset management; the other was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to the large amount of money they could use to rotate the all-mighty wheel.
Two names relate to UBS growth: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wolfley and Ospel were a dream team," says bank analyst Hans Geiger.
"Walfly, the outstanding intellectual, modest and deeply understanding models and statistics, and the Ospel, with its internal instinct, went all the way upstairs, starting with the intern in the bank."
But the Ashel eventually put it on Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake, "He thought his models were real," says Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride is preceded by defeat.
UBS are well aware of the meetings of government members at which Wolfli has always repeated the same slogan to move Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was headed by a tournament table, where bank successes were made.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of this way.
UBS was the largest player in currency trade and public securities.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak place, according to the parameter referred to in the bank terminology as “permanent income”, the UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in American mortgage products.
To close the hole, the UBS got involved in an adventure that barely cost him his life.
In an effort to increase, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in American sub-standard securities.
This has developed into a big mechanism that combined the securities, based on American mortgage loans, and sold them further, continuing to carry the risks.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way to get out of this process, the UBS has not stopped.
"UBS purchased until the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," says a bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to go as the bank tried to make order more difficult than it seemed.
The UBS posts have become children's chairs and remain unreliable until now.
Anyone who leads this huge bank faces almost no challenge.
He must find a strategy for the bank that has turned back on all the existing business models.
The Geiger banking analyst already has the idea of relinquishing investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be stabilized substantially.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Switzerland banker was in fact considered only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly separated from his predecessor, Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to demonstrate character and now, as stated by the Zurich Bank on Tuesday, has headed the UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3,500 jobs.
But it won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision of development.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
Axel Weber certainly asks these questions.
Publicly, he just said that he and his wife were looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fears of recession in Europe go down the American Stock Exchange
The current recession in Europe has deteriorated the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome was not very effective.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has hampered the hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the embryo.
The general relief that followed the change of government in Rome and Athens has not been backed up.
Euro fell towards the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered to be half full, not half empty, but now the problems are re-entered, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges were, inter alia, on sales lists.
The industrial index of Dow Jones has been closed at 12.078 with a fall of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer varied between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1251 point, falling per cent.
The Nasdaq Technological Index lost 0.8 per cent, trading at 2657 locations.
Frankfurt Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5985 points.
Industry in 17 euro zones has significantly reduced production and adapted to the end of growth.
The Eurostat Statistical Service reported that in September companies had produced two per cent less than in the previous month.
This report spurred American investors into skepsis, "We're not on the island, we're dependent on them," said Steve Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe was unlikely to fasten the recession and that banks showed further signs of weakness.
The legendary investor Warren Buffet was able to confirm these concerns, and in an interview with CNBC, he said that it was still unclear whether Europe was strong enough to do what was needed to end the crisis.
In his view, therefore, it was too early to invest in European public bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffet dumped a decade-long principle into the trash basket and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investments in IBM amounting to more than $10 billion raised the price of this oldest company's shares by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares were close at $187.35, with almost no change.
Buffet stated that he paid an average of $170 per share and now had a share of 5.5 per cent.
The price of his investment company, Berkshire Hathway, fell by 1.3 per cent.
The shares of the Bank of America fell by 2.6 per cent, much stronger than the market.

The shares of 630 companies had completed the sales, 1913 falling and 82 remaining at the same level at Nasdaq at 1.38 billion shares.
Crowds of intent fill cities
The players are considered to be troubled birds in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to be expelled from cities.
Some love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible, and the crows have been part of the city landscape for centuries, but people who complain about mud and noise are growing in many settlements.
The solution to the bird problem, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first Crown Symposium, in Ler in East Freezia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to be driven out of towns.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Finding Urban Alternatives
Conservationists argued that the root of the urban problem was in the migration of particularly protected gallons, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly disrupting traditional habitats.
The hunting, the expansion of the construction and disposal of traditional trees made life more difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
There are large colonies in Zestphalia and in the northwest of Yever, Dipholce, Achima under Bremen and Lera, with over 600 parental couples.
A mixed project to shoot the Crown in Lera caused grudging newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the fishing of birds in traps and their beating with sticks as a special cruelty.
"Simplified movement and spraying do nothing." said Architecture and landscape designer Werner Claver of Lear.
Manfred Caiser, environmental expert from Lara, Baden-Württemberg, said that the dumping of nests is often undesirable.
"Living people are scattered, and large colonies are divided and extended to other areas."
Intimidation is possible only in the form of exceptions near hospitals, homes of the elderly and schools.
"We have to live with them.
The problem in cities will not be solved in the distance from the surrounding areas, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
The combination of birds ' intimidation from those in need of protection in the residential areas and their inducing them to return to other areas could be an exit.
"Information stands instead of benzopil" was a slogan proposed by psychologist Utah Maria Jurgents and ethnologist, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We must be sure of ourselves to cope with this problem."
Jürgents was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schlezwig-Golstein, where information on the information stands is provided with information about the life of very thoughtful gamblers.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jurgents also expressed her opinion about the noise complaints made by birds, "The noise is a great deal of information, and they have to tell each other a lot of things."
The gambles often use not only tools to capture the gambled, but they also make the guns themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested a bird mind measure on four players.
In one experiment, birds quickly realized that they had to knock on a rainbow to get a larvae of moth.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the rain.
In another experiment, sound players had to do a more difficult task.
The researchers placed a small ceiling with a moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get the bell.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds took the wire to make terns and use terns to tie the ceiling behind the pen and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done this since the first attempt.
Ronaldou is bringing Portugal to Euro-2012.
The hopes of Bosnians and Turks for victory in the last minute have not lasted long.
The Favorists of Portugal, Croatia and Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Croatia, Portugal, Czech Republic and Ireland took the latest places in the Euro-2012 Championship in Poland and Ukraine.

The Czech Republic was 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of Plei-off versus Montenegro's off-site, after the first round was purely won (2:0).
Croatia had not missed its chance of playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland had easily reached accounts 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.

Ronaldou took an early start, hit free at a gate of about 30 meters.
The good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his far-reaching ability, from a 25-metre mark, increasing the account to 2:0.

The former Wolfsburg leader of Manchester City's English championship sent his ball to the bottom of the trouser, but the ball did not cross the gate line.
Yirach's forbearing Czech
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was the focus.
Following an attack on Elder Pashtig in the Bosnians' 36th minute fine, Stark decided that the Portuguese player was simulating and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a doubtful hand barometer after Foal Fabiu Kuentran - Misimović implemented it.
After a break in Europe's vice championships, the account was added to four more heads.
Petr Yirach dissolved all the remaining doubts about the Czechs for the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are sent to the European Championship five consecutive times.
The team of coach Michal Bilek and legislators of Bundesliga Mihael Kadlez (Bayer Levercusen) and Thomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) also smiled after an error at the outset that could have been catastrophic.
The doctor Peter Chech for the 9th minute, thanks to the instant reflex, prevented the potential Tomas Sivoka car.
The best chance of Montenegro was when Stephen Jobetic and Dean Damianovic were duetted on the field.
Damianović attacked the edge of the fine at 40 minutes and barely killed Chehu's nak.
After the interruption, the scrap was saved by the already wrecked needle of the world class of Chech after the forward FC Seoul left the field for 50 minutes.
The winner was killed just before the final whistle.
Meanwhile, Turkey lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks were unable to play better than 0.0 in Zagreb.
Although it is now almost unquestionable that the coach of the Gas Hiddink collector will now free the seat on the bench of the team that reached the third seat in 2002, the Croats are now in the final tour of the European Championship.
The Turks have almost been able to start 31,000 audiences at the Maximir Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's further blow for seven minutes was in the back, and the attacker Kazim Kazim was unable to break the ball into the net.
Croatia then woke up and gained control of the game.
After a break, the Croats continued the game in excellent shape.
The Legislators of the Bundesliga Daniel Pranich (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aynfracht, Frankfurt) were in the field with Mario Manjukić of the Wolfsburg team, who had taken the place of Ivan Perishic from Dortmund for 62 minutes.
Trapattony's on Euro-2012.
The Irish people in Dublin celebrated their first visit to Euro after Germany in 1988.
The team of the coach Jovanni Trapattoni -- who had already looked certain of her place after the first victory of 4:0 -- captured leadership for the 32rd minute thanks to the head of Stephen Ward.
Constantine Vasilev of the guest team compared the account for the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the very beginning, but only at the 23rd minute Robbie Keen from Los Angeles hit the first clean headlamp.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender had been able to prevent Ireland from moving forward.
Hall was killed for the 32nd minute.
After walking on Paul’s guard, Ward was in the right place, and by passing the ball through the line, he changed the bill by 1:0.

Mass killings - human dimension
The tense and very good new book Peter Englund "Beautiful and Woe: Personal History of the First World War" begins with a long list of actors whose heart is dying.
Here's how to read the next: be careful to clear this page and use it as a bookmark.
You'll get to know these people very close as you tell Mr. Englund, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your lighthouse at the moments when, like one of these men and women, you'll get rid of the road and lose in the mist of war.
Mr. Angelund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize on Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it quite precisely as "working on anti-history."
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, feasible journalists, or tactics and warfare.
It's not as much a book as it was, he explains, "How much a book about what it looked like," it's about "sense, impressions, experiences, and the state of the spirit."
The book “Beautiful and Trouble” has combined the experience of 20 more than or less intriguing men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolchildren and caregivers to Alpinists, doctors, ambulance drivers and employees.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone's gonna get captive, lose his hand or his leg, get mad or die.
Their lives are flickering here like church candles: new ones are added to a multitude of others, and some will be extinguished at that time.
The book of Mr. Englund is a departure from the standard of historical books.
It is also an amendment to the submission that the First World War was only a heavy trench war in the West Front.
"Beautiful and sad" is a master of other theatres of hostilities: the Alp, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers fall on the bee hives in this book; one of them meets Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is the tsetse flies.
It's a fascinating book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina smelling of smokeless dust.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your children, will you stay in place or run away?
Anyway, who's going on?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why you have to fight in this war.
"Sufficiency of fact," observes Mr. Angelund, "followed by speculations, assumptions, hopes, fears, imposing ideas, conspiracy, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Beautiful and sad" tracks the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German Open Sea Flot.
Their stories are largely taken from memoirs, letters and other publications already published.
The stories about their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are highly alive because of Mr. Anglound's small moments and intriguing details.
Many of them are about deprivations and how to deal with them.
Speaking the story of a German school girl, he says, "Erzac, everywhere erzac."
"A substitute, counterfeit aluminium, non-real rubber, paper trunks, wooden buttons."
He's still talking about the ersa foam in Germany.
It describes “the meat of the pressed rice of ram fat (and decorated with false bone made of wood); the tobacco made of dried roots and dried potatoes; the shoes undertook by the tree.”
He notes that there were “837 registered substitutes for meat authorized in the production of colbasa, 511 registered substitutes for coffee”.
Some stories tell us about honor and courage.
One American observes in itself the tendency to be cruel and says of the war, "You feel that, after all, this is what men have been created for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarette and whiskey, evening newspaper or besteller, and to claim that this show is a civilization and your tinkered shirt does not hide barbaric."
The British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or be disappointed.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrificing, he would like to think that this will happen in front of the public," he writes.
But it's the opposite, it's scary to look like "the sentenced man who's been hanging in secret."
Other comments concern the collapse of old Europe and new forms of fear.
"Conflict was becoming more economic competitors," writes Mr. Anglound, "war factories."
He observes the coming of someone who is called “a new species in the untiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-silden suit, which carries a massacre, sitting at a written table.”
People act in an unforeseen way: low-deeds are as much as heroism.
Mr. Angelund told of soldiers who had tried to get a venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid service on the front.
"The very grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in the Gonorrey Dwarf, which the soldiers bought and lubricated on their own genitals in the hope of going to hospital," he writes.
"The despairers have wiped him in their eyes, which has often led to life blindness."
The prose of Mr. Englund, translated with Swedish Peter Greyves, is flexible but negotiable, perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In tens of the small scenes, he shows how war “freeed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People start asking why their leaders make them fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as "The Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassell or such novels as "The West Front Without Change" by Eriha-Marie Remarca, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this insane pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final that I can remember in a bad literature.
I won't tell him.
But it's like he's got to the page with a list of characters, grabbed it from your hands, and burned it with a match.
After a previous mistake, a carefully calculated raid
Hundreds of police officers were engaged in the operation, some in protective helmets.
Night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because the Zukotti Park was supposed to be the least people in that time.
The operation was kept secret from all but a few high-ranking officers, and the others first said they were leaving for teaching.
Police Commissioner Raymond U. Kelly was at the centre of the events, and his presence stressed how much importance the Department of Police had attached to the operations.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of list gas against protesters, which was contrary to the departmental rules and caused the public to be sympathized with the occupants.
Thus, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation was launched to free Zukotti Park protesters.
The authorities were preparing to observe occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis teachings were held on the island of Randels in Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called counter-terrorism riot trainings, involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers, in view of Lower Manhattan.
The last training was held on Monday night on East River Manhattan side.
The order came into the park at the last minute, and the source was familiar with orders in which the assignment was referred only to as "training."
"These few cops I know and who were summoned to do so didn't say they were being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke under anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons for secrecy was the lesson that the city learned.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clear the park, but they retreated before hundreds of protesters who had been indoors before the scheduled deadline, hearing about the plans.
On Tuesday, various police units, including police teams from districts, were involved in the operations, which were usually used to control criminal areas around the region.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as workplaced, came and left the park during the day, which made it an hour of the night a suitable time to arrive.
"That was the right thing to do when the park is the least of the people," he said.
Rescue cars with searchlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
A searchlight and a recorded message from loudspeakers seem to have intimidated many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protesters just gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the tents had not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters the time to gather the things.
Other police teams, according to eyewitnesses, met at a perimeter to enter if arrests were needed in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a representative of the Head of the Police Department, said that this was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been given a witness to the police and that the police have treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that cars with telecamers on Cherc Street, along the western border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went to the west through the bore of personal objects of protesters, including bags, plastic carpets and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Sanitary Department teams followed her, collecting what had been abandoned.
Some protesters who refused to leave were pulled out, photographs of this soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions next to the kitchen camp, at the center of the park.
Some have built barricades, and the police were entering, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp's episcentre hooked themselves together for hands.
And two people got themselves tied up with the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Rescue officers were called to cut the locks.
No arrests were taken in the park until about 3:30 a.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The cleaning operation was completed in about 75 minutes, and the police reported.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 persons had been arrested in the park.
The majority were arrested for “a disturbance of public order and resistance in detention”, he said.
The highest-level officer in the field was Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, head of the police searches in the department, was there too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, “not led the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second police team was waiting along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if it needed to enter.
The barriers were placed in Cortland Street, a quarter north of the park, and in Pine Street, a quarter south.
The observers saw the police extend the perimeter even farther away from the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people further.
About 28 people were in the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night took place south of the park.
About five o'clock in the morning south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped on the roof of a police car, while others, according to eyewitnesses, fired air from police van tyres.
At some point, a piece of fountain has flew out of the crowd.
As a result, a police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
Trade Union of School Serving Personnel will bring the city to court for dismissal
Trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who have lost their places last month, plans to bring the city to court on Wednesday, stating that dismissals were not necessary and were discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students are enrolled.
Judicial proceedings are probably the last means available to the Union of the District Council of 37 to try to abolish dismissal.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, working with parents and other employees who were among the lowest-paid employees in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the fact that the trade union leaders called the political response to their refusal to provide the city with access to health funds managed by groups of workers to close the hole in the budget last spring.
Urban officials categorically rejected the accusation.
At the Urban Council hearings last month, the Chancellor of Schools, Dennis M. Walcott, said that dismissals were part of the budget they had signed in June.
One of the Board members coupled, telling him that nowhere in the budget had been indicated that school support staff would be dismissed.
Representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had notified the claims by warning the Department of Education that a claim was filed against them; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to file a formal complaint before the Supreme Court of the State in Manhattan.
As respondents, Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the City will be listed as respondents, and eight temporary workers will be dismissed as plaintiffs, all black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the City Legal Department, said that the city had not seen a claim and could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint before New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim for unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and there were few in the Upper East Said or Tribek schools, 17 school supporters lost their places in the district of 23 in Browsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave the districts of 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
While noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants who worked at a free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the complaint states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill the gaps in the budget”.
P.S. The 36th budget was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way in which to calculate additional funding for every poor student who enters school.
Trade Union also claims that school directors could be misleaded by a notification that allows dismissal of focal points for work with parents.
The notice used the word “excess”, although the word “excess” was more commonly referred to when the teacher from the school payroll was moved to the list of available employees paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six focal points for work with parents were dismissed," says the draft claim, "and not just transferred."
Mission over, Congress is ready for the Libyan Agreement
It seems that the Republicans and democrats in the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the Libyan rebellion.
All it needed was for the rebellion to succeed, a long-standing dictator Muamar Kaddafi was captured and killed, and the American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Committee should consider a resolution put forward by the President John Kerry (Democrates, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McKain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (Independent, Connectikut), who commend the Libyans for the successful rebellion and the United States troops for their “respect”.
“The purpose of this resolution is to honor the courageous people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country,” said Kerry.
“This is a confirmation of their support for the democratic aspirations of both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions that endorse or condemn the role of the American Army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution allowing the limited use of the United States armed forces in Libya.
The draft law was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority vote of both parties and has not yet been voted to the Senate.
But on the same day when the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the Chamber also failed to support a proposal that would cut down the financing of the United States operation in Libya.
This left the United States mission with a kind of legislative purgatory -- when Congress is frustrated enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not so angry that it can actually kick the soil out of her foot.
Then the events stemmed the indecision of the Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels and, on 20 October, Kaddafi was killed.
NATO Mission officially concluded on 31 October.
The Senate can now be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “recognized by the people of Libya for their incredible bravery and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom” and thanked the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who had participated in the military operation for the protection of the Libyan people for their outstanding courage and professionalism”.
The resolution also “approves the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will new measures be fully supported by the Council for Foreign Affairs or dissolved by legislators as the June Bill?
Senator Richard H. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee, spoke against the last version.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the last version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitolia House of Representatives this week must vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republican and some of the democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by a member of the House of Representatives by Bob Goodlat (republican, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary of the Congress.
Other legislators have not yet been able to introduce their amendments to the plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Gudlat's amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that affect a wide range of issues that have been made in that convening.
Some duplications - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and in the Senate - others were slight variations.
There are at least 15 versions of the Balanced Budget Amendments only in the House of Representatives and a number more on “Contracting Federal Expenditures”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mostly to the newly elected Republicans wishing to adorn their summaries, the opportunity to boast that they have “suggested” such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required that both the House of Representatives and the Senate vote for the amendment of the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of an unconditional resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congresses wish to limit the term of office of the members of the Congress, and a member of the House of Representatives, José Serrano (Democrates, New York) wishes to cancel the restriction of two terms for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Junior (Democrates, Illinois) proposed numerous amendments guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment prohibiting single-sex marriages has been proposed for many years, like another forbidding flag incineration.
Some legislators also wish to allow the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the States object to them.
As members of the Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are no quicker than in previous years.
In the 111th congress, legislators proposed 77 of these amendments and made 66 in the 110th.
This rate will be measured in comparison with the beginning of the 1990s, when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they did nothing more than now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, 27, was approved in 1992, but it was actually submitted to Congress in 1789.
"Brought but not winned," says Gifffords in his first television interview after the attempt.
Ten months after the armed man shot at her in focus on the public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, underwent a musical show from the Broadway show “The Sun will come tomorrow” and said that he wanted to get better than to return to Congress.
Having emerged from the 20/20 Y-Bi News programme with Diana Soyer, Giffords had been difficult to formulate proposals and needed assistance in walking.
The programme showed her a difficult way of recovery after a bullet had been hit by a skull and smashed the left side of the brain from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she suddenly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill on the limit debt.
In her first television interview after the January shooting, in which 13 people were killed and wounded, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "hard."
Soyer's question, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Gifffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the “20/20” hour special issue, which was shown on the eve of the new book of Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The special release told of the rehabilitation of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
On Kelly's first few weeks video, she's lying on a hospital bed with a razor head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Gifffords sitting in a wheelchair and physiotherapists teaching her how to do simple actions.
Kick your head.
Get your lips out.
And then her first word, "what."
A few days later, Gifffords said the second word, "tost," a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video EBC shows that music played a central role in cureing Gifffords: we see the congressman singing with the "Girls just want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview, Soyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she didn't remember the day of the attempt.
Her husband told me that he had read the Giffords article in the 12 March shooting paper when she stopped him to ask the first time about the six who were killed.
The suspected attacker, Jard Li Lafner, is detained in Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment in anticipation of trial.
"Many people have died," said Giffords Soyer.
"It's hard, hard, hard."
One day when she was recovered, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm over."
"And I said, "Gabby, you're not winning," said Kelly.
You're just beaten.
And you're going through this, you're gonna get better and come back stronger than ever.
The warrior feels more sorry than respect.
The event was a Wall Street holiday that collected millions of dollars for the homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballot about helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and marine infantrymen were signaled to march around him.
The stomach auditorium applauded him standing.
"The soldiers looked like heroes," said David Salzman, who organized a spring collection of money.
The Senior Military Officer at the concert, at which he was also the then Chairman of the Staff Chiefs Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” wrote the officer in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respectful, it was pity.
Quite opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
The warriors are distributing praises for their sacrifices.
But the praises have their price, the soldiers say.
The public feels more and more as if it feels sorry for people in form.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and is soon on his way to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to show some support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive theme for military leaders who do not want to look unthankful or dissenting with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger experienced by returning troops in recent years of war in Viet Nam was much worse.
As a result, most pity talks take place quietly and only between war veterans.
After two of his sons returned from the hostilities of the marine infantry, the Colonel in his resignation, Mark Kenchn, warned them that the people not from the army would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration because they thundered the rebels and were in exotic places.
Others would think that there was no "under the mask of a cruel evil veteran," said Kenchn, who fought in Iraq and, on his return, took a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were careful to ask if he could withstand the stress of responsible work in Washington immediately after the fighting.
Kenstein recalls how he said to his sons, "When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative effects."
The awkwardness of the military is partly due to American indifference to wars.
Victories in the battlefield are rarely commended by a country that is not familiar with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer appreciate military heroism as usual in World War II,” says the Lieutenant-General in the resignation of David Bernow, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is concentrated mainly on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
The troops are estimated by the number of trains they have done, by the number of comrades they lost or by the scale of loss.
Army faces the increasing pressure of supporters to fight rape
This week ' s historic hearings must be decided whether a claim by 28 men and women against the Army to accuse the non-intervention of rape would be adopted.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will be in line with the following.
Elizabeth Lyman, first grade, was raped by her colleague at night for 25 years and 11 weeks for pregnancy.
It was in October 2008 that she returned to her barracks in the Miramar airfield north of San Diego after dinner with her friend and met a male colleague carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Texas's crop took off her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instinct then."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man came to her back, fell and raped, says she.
This week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 current and former military personnel will be strenuously awaiting the judgment of the court at the historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the action they have filed against the former Minister of Defence, Robert Gates, and his predecessor, Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim states that Gates and Ramsfeld have not been able to deal with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim submitted in February by Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 plaintiffs but grew up to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men who all claim that they had been raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow workers and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or failed to ensure due justice after alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeted at the top of the army because the problem begins with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?"
Burke also said that she had been contacted by some 400 other victims since February, many of whom could participate in future claims.
Her strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case -- putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, it's going to open a lot of work if it's needed to maintain pressure.
The defence team of the Ministry of Defence, led by the Federal Prosecutor Neil McBrayd, took steps to discontinue the case.
The Judicial Documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mostly consisting of the fact that former or current soldiers cannot file claims by the army for damage to the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, Doctrine Ferez, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by persons in the military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs”, states the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still formally forbidden to participate in battle, this division is only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the fighting zone.
The result: 150 women soldiers — two thirds of them in battle — died between the two wars.
It's time for the army to become modern, says Burke.
She's not alone in her struggle; three others are in addition to her claim.
At the Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against the four largest military academy in charge of promoting a women's hate atmosphere.
A separately non-profit association of American veterans of war in Viet Nam is preparing a suit against the army in which the diagnoses of “personal change” who are victims of violence to remove them from their service are common, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwat, of the human rights group, the Organization of Action for Women soldiers.
Its group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing him of discriminatory treatment of pensions for people who claimed to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives of both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Trafficking Prevention and Sexual Violence Service, 3.158 rape attempts were reported.
However, it is reported that the attacks are often not reported, and according to Pentagon ' s own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 per cent of the alleged 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also investigates the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases reached court cases, twice as few as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case refer to attacks against them only as the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of rape separately 11 times to the police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge in a hearing in which she was asked whether she had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six men gave a positive character to the accused, who was ultimately justified.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was playing, I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric office, and when I left, I remember my commander said, "It wasn't a trial for him, it was a trial against me."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a change of identity, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with poor language, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the case put forward by Lyman and her suitmates is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at George Washington University School of Law.
However, he notes: “I believe they are in a position to move forward.”
The doctrine that has been criticized since it appeared stands between them and the verdict.
I've been criticizing Doctrine Ferez all my life.
The army has been retreated for decades because it has no incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds: "Shances are largely against them ... but it is important for them to try."
These things will change only when good people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favour, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiff, will gather hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is no reform,” she says.
Or until we die, depending on what's going to happen before.
The walls have eyes: How do researchers study you on Facebook?
Before becoming a new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Brejvik was a regular guy to present his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to the massacre in Norway in July, which killed 77 people, appeared at his first public hearing.
Although Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from alone online; he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer with millions of nationalists who support right groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how can we find them?
It's easy to just go to Facebook.
"We realized that it was easy to approach them," says Jaimy Bartlett, the lead author of the recently published report on the European cyber populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The record of personal data on Facebook is so large, says Bartlett, that researchers could easily use the website's advertising tool to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that marketers have been doing for several years.
The Bartlett team found half a million fans of right groups throughout Europe and then promoted advertising, but instead of showing a new group or dietary product, the advertising offered the user to undertake a survey that raised questions about their level of education, their attitude to violence and their optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, they were able to interview more than 10,000 participants of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries without even leaving the office.
"This is a completely new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not as impressive as the right-wing groups are mostly male youth, dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less aggressive than those who hide behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and politicians use the site to study everything in the world, from health to social trends expressed in Laikh, post on the wall and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three entries per day, Facebook's “subper-actual information” is a boom of research, increasing the number of scientific articles in the title of the site by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot approach a notebook on the street.
"Rearer, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," says Bartlett.
"FaceBook excludes all of this, you turn to them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and examine social health problems.
The latest study by Dr. Megan Morona of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues, showed that students discussing their drunken vices in Facebook were much more susceptible to the risk of alcoholism than students who were silent on the subject.
Morono suggests that students, such as their hostage tutors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates the drinking status too often.
"You can't solve the problem without detecting it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christoxis, co-author Morono, and Director of the Children's Health, Conduct and Development Centre at the Children's Research Institute of Seattle.
"We've found a way to identify children from a risk group that we wouldn't find otherwise."
Facebook also regularly collects data on its users.
The website data-processing team reviewed the status and day statistics of St. Valentine, the appearance of voters in the mid-term in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (usually using information available only to them, cyberfree champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available to the research community).
But Facebook users know that the site watches them, likes them, or doesn't -- in exchange for playing Skrabble with a friend in thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become involved in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strictly defined standards for offline research, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users have at least thought about what a researcher can monitor their profiles," says Nail Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using the public pages of Facebook students.
"As much as they imagined, it was only between them and their friends."
The question of methodology then arises.
Even offline has no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
In Facebook, it is not possible to know how many information in the profile and the user page are true.
"What you say in Facebook and what you do outside Facebook is two completely different things," says Selvin.
That is why, despite its years of technological research, Selvin thinks that the notebook and the pen are still the best research tools to use.
"Nothing can replace the way out into real peace and communication with real people," he says.
“Social research is supposed to be social, and most of the social studies are still offline.”
"Clean and Inhuman": Anders Bering Brejvik will be publicly tried for the first time
Anders Bering Brejvik, a man who confessed to a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter at the first public appearance in Oslo court.
“I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Rizarei of Tamplières of Norway”, he said before 500 in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I admit actions, but I don't admit guilt."
Judge Torquiel Nescheim interrupted Bravik during this monology, because he didn't want to give Breyvik the opportunity to use this hearing as a site for expressing his own views.
For the same reason, he refused to authorize Brevík, who had delivered the written speech with him, to contact the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nessheim also ordered the police to hold Bravik in custody for another 12 weeks, prohibited his access to the media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivica in the eyes, others to make sure he's held under the castle.
All came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian channel NRK one of the survivors in Utah.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made me feel a little easier when I saw and heard the suspect."
Brewick, dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, kept calm and professionalism throughout the hearing and looked in the eyes of journalists and survivors when he came in and out of the building.
Despite the strange idea of Breivik that he was part of the great opposition movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with his associates.
Some may be comforted by the fact that the attacks of July 22 seem to be the work of a single extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but that's not the way," said the relative of a victim.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, which is shown in this week's theater
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Innovator of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can count as the greatest discovery in a newly discovered interview, which they remember in advance of the prerequisite in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and in production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer and thought he was a hippie, but he was also a predatory organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from "the pains to think that the really big idea is 90% of work... [but] the great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skilled work."
So, back in 1995, Bob Cringley was creating a television series of Triumph Nerds on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, about 10 years had passed since Job was expelled from Apple, and he had been working all the time in his new NeXT computer company waiting for a massive Internet development.
While a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nards, he says the original interviews were lost in transportation.
Only after Job's death was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This renovated material, slightly edited, was the basis for the 68-minute film of Steve Jobs: Lost Interview, which comes in Landmark Theaters on this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a person known for his hatred for detailed interviews, Jobs seems unusually ready here to express his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers -- meditation for 10 to 15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more precisely.
There are also moments where Job's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems to be annoying Kringley's questions, which make him move faster to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Era Pyxar, ipods and iphons of Lost Interview, there's something more ominously prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies do correctly and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technology.
One thing is to read about Job's death evaluations, but there's something inspiring and inspiring in Jobs, which we see here, a worrisome dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should have been.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of the seven significant findings of the lost interview:
About how he learned how to lead the business:
"For all the time in the business I've been asking, "Why do you do this?" and the answers you always get, "Oh, it's just doing that."
No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, no one thinks very deeply about business.
That's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize the reporting in Apple.
Disappointed by the way in which to record the costs, often beginning with the standard costs, which were taken from the ceiling and then retracted by means of a “declining”, he created an automated structure that guaranteed that they would be able to track business costs up to a little.
About the pope's joke:
Jobs describes in detail the blue box that he had with Steve Woznyak, a device that enabled people to effectively break up the telephone company and call for long distances free.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' euphoria here, when you describe the blue box as an act of power is contagious.
He tells us how he and Vozniak tested a box using a phone automobile, ordering a conversation, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connect as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the globe half a dozen times, and you've yelled a phone-tomat, and it's penetrated a minute later into a neighbor's cell phone," says Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned is that we could invent something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could baffle a little thing that could control a big thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think without that, it could ever be Apple.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous exit that he and Wozniak had practically dealt with by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking Pope's phone to try hard to copy Henry Kissinger.
When the different members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two burst out laughter just before the pope was raised to answer on the phone.
About technology enrolment (and the cold proclamation of Bill Hulett):
When he was 12 years old, he found Bill Hulett in a phonebook and called him in the search for spare parts to collect a frequency meter.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a summer work in Hewlett Parkerd.
"It had a strong influence on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees."
Jobs later became a member of the HP who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer."
He was the size of the suitcase, he had a little monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I often traveled to HP by a teenager and rotated around that car and wrote programs for it.
On improvised innovation:
In a few places of interview, Jobs talks about the invention of new foods on the summer.
At the dawn of his career, when he went out to sell a handful of fees, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
While working only 30 days in credit, he had to think about the collection and delivery of ready devices.
Later in Apple, he recalls the difficulties he encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the violent arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], and I was washed up my throat, and I came out and found a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15 that was incredibly reliable.
About large companies that lose energy:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs had accurately foresaw how many industry leaders would be mistaken in seeing the situation and lose control over their share of the market.
"Let's say you work in IBM or Xerox, so you do the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company's not getting any more successful.
Selling and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who eventually come to management by companies, and the people who make the product are pushed away from the decision-making area.
The product, which led to this monopolistic position, is crowded out by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required skill.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could take over the whole information technology industry.
He could've been ten times as big as that, could be Mikerosofft of the '90s...
They were defeated by the victory.
Innovation as a form of art:
"The great idea of a great product separates a huge amount of skilled work... when you twist a big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll learn a lot about her thinness.
There are compromises that you need to go to -- some things you can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your mind -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
Ultimately, everything comes to taste -- everything comes to trying to express itself in the best that people have ever done, and later -- trying to bring it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
Part of what McIntos made famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who had come to be the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are lunching with opponents of the health law while the court is considering the case.
On the day that the Supreme Court met with closed doors to discuss a politically controversial question whether it would hear the revocation of the law on the health of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonine Scalia and Clarence Thomas, held for lunch sponsored by a legal firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
This case took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss petitions.
One of the cases on the agenda was the application supported by 26 states which challenged the rapid revision of health, adopted by Congress last year, of a law that united conservative activists throughout the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, the turning debate of 5,1/2 hours is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be an obstacle to the presidential race, which will be at the outset by the time the judgement was heard.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the health law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney-General at the time of President George W. Bush.
The Clement Law firm, Bancroft PLC, was one of almost two dozen firms who helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Society of Federalists, a long-standing group that has consistently upheld conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the oppression.
The lunch was held at Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health law.
Honorable guests at lunch?
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the activities of the Society of Federalists for many years.
This does not contradict ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
Had they been subject to, they might have come under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “The judges may attend charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge may not be a rapporteur, an honourable guest or mentioned in the programme of such an event”.
However, the apparent proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with a large financial interest, was sufficiently a signal for ethics activists in the Government.
“This flagrant violation of ethics and indifference to the Code is contrary to the statements made by some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Affairs.
"They have drank and dinner at the official money-gathering action with the lawyers whose cases are currently before the court."
Their emergence and assistance in the collection of money for this activity undermines all declarations of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix the cases with those in the cases of groups such as the Society of Federalists.
And Thomas's wife, Jeannie, is a famous conservative activist.
Moreover, the conservatives claim that this is the case with Judge Helena Kagan, and not of Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Obama administration when the first judicial objections to the law were filed at the level of the First Instance Court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in the protection of the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan has never shown that she's going to do that.
Boeing gets a record 18 million order on planes.
Emirates' airline orders 50 Boeing 777 broadband liners and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the transaction size is more than $1 billion.
It's hardly the news that the company is ordered for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. plane builder, and the pre-emptive price for all of these 50 planes is $18 billion.
It is as important where Boeing was ordered: the Middle East, the growing gold, lived for future orders on the planes.
In a forecast issued on Monday, the Chicago company estimated that the Middle East would need 2.520 aircraft at a cost of 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced on these weekends his largest dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft -- 50 Boeing 777 two-passing Boeing aircraft.
An incredible order was received from Emirates Airlines in Dubai.
The airline also has an opportunity to purchase 20 additional aircraft that will raise the total pre-scort price to $26 billion, Boeing stated on Aviasho Dubai 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, so-called Dreamliner, which could be praised by a much better fuel saving and passenger convenience.
The pre-scort price for six planes is more than $1 billion.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said the Morningstar Nile Diora.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many of the near-east airlines own the oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, not only do they have money to pay for the aircraft, but they also have increased fuel prices, which are usually detrimental to airlines, as one of the largest objects of expenditure is not so destructive because the country earns money at high oil prices.
It's important because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel orders when the prices go up, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates' command strengthens Boeing leadership in the broad fluse airplane market and helps prevent the Airbus SAS rival from attacking his rule with his airliner A350.
Boeing's victory on the air show took place four months after airbus had declared that he would postpone the largest A350, which was competing exactly from 777 to 300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the autumn load after buyers demanded that the cargo and the distance of the flight be increased.
Boeing Co shares grew by 1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico evidently lost in the Michoacan elections
Louise Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers helped Opposer Fausto Vallejo of the RPI in the pre-election race.
President Felipe Calderon, the sister of President Felipe, seems to have failed to implement her application for Governor Michoacana during the violent public elections, and she stated on Monday that drug traffickers helped to incite a race in favour of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results indicate that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP, is the leader of the West State Governor's race.
“The intervention of organized crime during the entire electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming not only for Michoacan but also for the whole country,” said Louise Maria Calderon on radio interview the following day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our electoral officers... they took the urns to vote, put the obstacles... and made people vote" for the IRP.
The IIR managed Mexico for seven decades until the Presidentship was lost in 2000.
She's preparing a return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this attempt.
IRI hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallecho seems to have slightly beaten Calderon, who led the ratings before the election day.
Calderon, a national action candidate, or PNI headed by her brother, refused to accept Vallecho as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DDR, now owned by the Governor's chair, came a third, a serious defeat for the divided and failure left to the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallecho, former mayor of the capital of Morella, denied the links with drug traffickers and encouraged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacana, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine have long been dominated.
This is President Calderon's native state, and he chose Michoacan to start a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence has continued.
The mayor from the PND was killed a week before the elections when he aggressed Luiz Maria Calderon, and several candidates came out of the local electoral race because of fear.
For the IIR, however, no matter how horrific the elections in Michoacana, the victory will give the party a driving impetus.
The man who was supposed to represent the IRP in the Presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valleho and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the next year's front door."
ABB convince Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to helping to save the eurozone from the European debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term downturn that will stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajt Nag, director of the ADB office in Manila, said that two of the fastest-growing economies should “make all they can” to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either by the International Monetary Fund or by direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries viewed Europe ' s difficulties “indifferently” and said that Asia ' s financial assistance side by side with European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"It's about all of us."
“That is why anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful,” he said in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent but may not be unduly vulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy ' s borrowing funds had increased threateningly, and the Prime Ministers both Italy and Greece had resigned.
The European debt crisis had created fears that it could bring the world economy back to recession and had called on the leading developing economies to gather together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Neg foretold that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation, such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance bonds, the funds to ensure financial stability in Europe, had a tremendous effect on the negotiations of the Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Commerce in India, said that India would do its best to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a decline in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory requirement, because where we find work for tens of millions of our young men and girls."
Others argue that for developing economies such as India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varshni, professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to politically support Europe for the Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live by $2 per day or less.
"They will find out at some point that the Greeks retire at 50 years of age and go to the sea holidays and that this will not be accepted well," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to include Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, wasteful enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Neg said that the Eurozone crisis threatened with “significant direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ADB projection of 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 was now faced with “positive risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop “extraordinary plans” to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The fearful warnings of the Pentagon on potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defense, Leon Panetta, escalated on Monday at Congress, warned that the expected automatic budget reductions would undermine national security and would lead to a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civil assembly.
Pentagon has already experienced a reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now fearful that additional reductions of 600 billion or more can be inevitable if the Congress cannot reach an agreement on expenditure.
“The consequences of these reductions will be destructive to the Ministry,” said Panetta in a letter to the senators of the Republic of John McKein, Arizona, and the Republican of Lindsi Gréham, South Carolina.
He said that the congress's failure to adopt a budget agreement and the so-called sevester resulting in a general reduction of 23 per cent and a cessation of many new projects.
"Such a strong reduction, so thoughtlessly applied, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfulfillable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building -- and cause serious damage to other modernization attempts," wrote the Senators.
"We also have to fire many of our state employees, and since the reduction will be done so quickly, we will almost certainly have to dismiss the state to achieve the goal."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and will cause serious damage to the war."
The reductions will eventually affect the military parts, said Panetta.
“While military funding in foreign emergency operations is not directly affected by a sequential service, military accomplishments will be seriously affected by a serious disruption in the core budgets”, warned Pannett.
“Contract personnel will be reduced, ending with the cancellation of contracts and the contract of oversight that supports troops.”
“Stat personnel will be reduced, resulting in late payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to Paneta 10 days ago, asking for details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
“The result of the sevester in the Ministry of Defence will be the rapid fall of the United States as the leading world military power.”
"We stand firm against this dragon act," told the senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they published the letter of the Panetta.
"It's not the way we can live with, and it's not the way we have to impose ourselves."
“The Sectur is a threat to the national security of the United States, and this cannot be done.”
Whether the letter of the Panetta or the latest warnings of the Senators will lead to a budgetary compromise or increase calls for Pentagon's release, we shall see later.
The Panetta was absolutely frank about possible reductions, although he had come to work in the Pentagon leadership after many years of budgetary reviews in Congress and the White House, and aware that it was faced with difficult choices.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence painted a sad picture of what might follow -- troops with a shell but without a nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a bulletless unit."
"This is the wing of the plane without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," said Panetta in his opening remarks in Pentagon.
"It's the force that suffers from a volatile war spirit, bad readiness, and is unable to fight potential enemies."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McKein and Graham Pannett, new details of how reductions are “sufficient operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and catastrophes; seriously limiting our opportunity to be the first to be deployed and reacted throughout the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future war operations”.
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already been tested, and some were only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 striker, a planned new bomber, a ballistic submarine of the new generation, a new coastal warship and a new ground-based warfare vehicle that the Army and the Marine Infant need to replace the Hammer.
The end of further development and testing of F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say that this is a vital next step to improve and confront the potential threats of China and other opponents.
How to Lie
A fleeting view of the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for the Presidents of the Republicans, Herman Kane, is charged with the charges of sexual harassment by several women; each party is accusing the other of a lie.
The Pennsylvania University administrations were charged with false witnessing because they allegedly concealed that a soccer coach retired raped boys.
Last week, President Nicolas Sarkosi of France was caught when Barak Obama, President of the United States, on the part of the microphone, said that Israel's Prime Minister Binjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
False destroys careers and shocks countries.
The New York Congressman and the Internet expotionist Anthony Weiner put himself up as a fool, denying his derivatives, which was quickly contested by indisputable evidence.
The former candidate for President John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during the campaign to cover out-of-marriage ties.
Again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton who finds himself lying about his sexual relations with Monica Levinsky during his second term of posting.
History of fraud at school and college is a normal case.
There were instances when teachers gave students answers to tests so that they could have a good assessment of their performance.
Teachers who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
One day, research shows, you can lie between 10 and 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of acquaintances.
Identification of falsehood or lying is necessary for everyone for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, let's say, the shalades, where you call "Happy!", the detection of a lie is a serious course of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of falsehood have been developed.
Liars look in their eyes.
They don't always stop, stutter, red, or fuss.
It should not be concluded that the liars are hard to notice and hard to expose.
An experienced detector of falsehood can come to the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the mimics, the structure of the issues and the timeliness.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a wide-ranging and growing segment of knowledge of falsehood, and it is clear that the detection of lies is a modern skill that can easily be learned and that helps guide our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include routing, interviewing, negotiating or governance.
Fine liars are skillful in reading others, making them feel unforced, controlling their own emotions and intuitive feelings as others perceive them.
We know from the study that extraвертs lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women are about others, usually to protect someone's feeling that married people are less liar to their partners than unmarried (but the lie they say is most often negligible).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty, deceiving you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "definition of initial state."
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing the changes further.
Observe the gambling, laughter, vocal characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know whether a person roars in a regular state, then you will not make unjust accusations when you see foot steering in the middle of the meeting.
Then seek groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal acts.
Think of these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Lyingers can record the upper part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their feet towards the door, lean to the exit, change their position in a certain way, or show “the relief after the interview” -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
The investigators often falsify the end of the interrogation signal to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, look at your object's speech.
Scott Peterson is known to have retreated and used the past, claiming that his wife is alive, leading to her search throughout the country.
The abusers may also use distance in speech, "I have not had sexual relations with this woman... Miss Levinski," or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely caught.
Someone can use "qualification language" when answering the difficult question, "Okay... truthfully... how well I know... how well I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect a lie, but you can learn how to detect a lie.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone not to be a victim of skilled buggers in professional and personal life.
The controversy plan for the oil pipeline needs to be revised after the US threat to postpone its approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, arousing the anger of trade unions, but reassuring environmental advocates, the oil pipeline company asserts that it will readily revise the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada reported on Monday night that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Peach Hills in Nebraska and that it would still be approved.
The company made the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of the State of Nebraska.
The representative of TransCanada, Alex Purbas, said that the company was confident that it would eventually receive approval on the oil pipeline, although on another route.
This is the case following a statement by the Department of State last week that it will defer the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Pescha Hills region and the Ogalala aquatic underground reserve of water.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise ordered by the Department of State is likely to dispatch decision-making until 2013, following the elections in the next year, although the authorities denied that the decision had interfered with the policy.
Obama, in a written statement last week, referred to the decision as an appeal from the Department of State and expressed its support.
The oil pipeline, with a length of 1,700 miles, should extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to get 700,000 barrels a day from Albert's province to the oil plants in Texas.
To do that, he needs to cross six states.
He is hated by environmental defenders, but he is loved by trade unions that hope for some 20,000 jobs associated with the oil pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators who oppose the plan are considering the bill to expedite the movement from the Sand Hills and the Ogalalla area, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the Department of State on Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but the source of energy in the industry stated that the auditor of the Department had ordered a separate review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Eliott, who was a adviser in Hillari Clinton's 2008 campaign, is a conflict of interest for the programme.
Another was whether the firm that had been hired to conduct an initial study was not appropriate because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patty La Belle was brought to court for allegedly causing a child sickness from fear.
The New York City family argues that the disco wonder of Patty La Belle began to burst into the lobby of their house in Manhattan, intimidating their little daughter to the extent that it was so terrified.
The Tirada of the Lady Marmalade, the executive, frightened the 18-month Geneva Monk, so much that she carried “a change of identity, sleep disorder” and “a strong fear of strangers”, says her family to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This was on November 10, last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the tutor of the kindergarten, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching a car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of a building on the Riverside bulwark with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped at the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came to me back and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said yes, and she went to pick her up," she said.
La Belle has angrily delivered her sentence to a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter behind the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you're talking about or thinking."
She became fierce and began to be abusive -- the word C and the word F, -- in high tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of a bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had a hysterical start.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
La Belle threw herself on her mother, who was still holding Geneva, and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that she was touched, she added.
Later, the family sent La Belle a note of apology but did not receive a reply.
Lawyer and representatives of La Belle are not responding to the commentary calls.
The amount of compensation for the injury is not reported, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he had taken up the case free of charge and that the family was planning to donate any money that would receive to the charity of the children with cancer.
"The purpose is to get Patty La Belle responsible for his actions," said Davis.
“This conduct is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child-education institution with an 18-month child on hand.”
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López's reign, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign financing decreased and the economy weakened.
2011, which will be part of the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, also called the year of change, which gave rise to high hopes for economic development, but given the unfavourable climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but the decline in key economic development indicators was recorded.
The low temperatures of February not only resulted in the loss of millions for the agricultural sector but also limited the potential for growth in the public economy by a total of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which had had an impact on the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on areas affected by the cold provided by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were damaged entirely and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially damaged, and the main crops were vegetables, corn and wool.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in state unemployment, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters, an accelerated increase in unemployment, from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa, with an increase of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, up to 5.28 per cent in the second quarter, and from July to September, it continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, the percentage of more than 74,000 unemployed people in Sinaloa, an increase of 18.969 compared with the first half.
Liquidity reduction
Unemployment in Sinaloa has been exacerbated by many factors over the course of the year, for economist Gerrardo López Servantez, Director of the Autonomous University Economic and Social Science Faculty (UAS), the increase of unemployment may be explained indirectly by the actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is the increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market, with a view to limiting the resources imposed by the law adopted at Congress to combat money-laundering, since it is difficult for people who own dollars to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
López Cervantes said that there was also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of employment abroad has been limited in the United States, especially because of the complexity of entry, and the second because, once in the course of their stay, they are already facing a lot of difficulties in finding employment, so that a group of people remains and demands jobs here, in the state, as a result of increasing unemployment," he said.
Violation of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is worse by paying attention to the large number of violations predominant in labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State is working without being mentioned as employees in any institution of social protection.
In addition to unemployment and inadequacy, another reminder of employment in the State is provided by low wages; the state has the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Social Security Institute and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was by September 5,352 pesos, much lower than the average in the country, which was 7.375 pesos.
FDI Reduction
In addition to the downturn in economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, was $630,697 from January to July of the State FDI, representing a decline of 87.74 per cent compared with $5.143.312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government has recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment in the course of the year, mostly from service companies.
Long
Against the background of the economic downturn, the State Government requested, during the State Congress, credit approval of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revitalize the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez shows a lack of capacity for the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was no need to harmonize the wishes of the various sectors, including the State Government itself.
“The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, it has to work hard to get back the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble our efforts, we have not been able to agree on the efforts of all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better,” he said.
Deceleration of the economy
López Loredo said that events such as early frosts stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“The small amounts of the economy are the result of several events, including the cold, one of the main effects of a slow economy, which is not fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Theodora Salazar Uriarte, President of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that the state needed to continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we found that we were working on it, we believe that a long-term programme that will redetermine the direction and economic course of the state is needed to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Work to be undertaken
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining a future direction in order to better guide the Government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme,” he said.
He noted that the current Administration had demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policies.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is beginning to get involved in the work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is much more to do," he said.
He's sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day income fine, such sentence was handed down to Navolato for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Attorney-General ' s Office reported that the sentenced drug dealer Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a crime against health, had been storing a marijuana for the purpose of proliferation.
According to the case AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrolling of Cypruso Valdes Street, before No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driven by a white peak car, where he was carrying a black bag in a box in a car and a small backpack in a passenger seat, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the removal was brought to the Second District Court, and the accused continues to be held in the Centre for Support of the Legal Consequences of Crime.
Contributions should be made to work
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Rescue of Public Proficiency and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being unfinished or overdue due to lack of funds, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, while working programmes were still being developed, they were at risk, as the State Government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be paid by the State, and that only the Federation and the Municipality had so far provided resources for work, so there was still a delay in completion.
"They must invest almost 12 million, and although the year ends, they didn't give us any penny when they were supposed to give us a part from the beginning of July," he said, "that we didn't postpone, we started our work and they're very advanced, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the governor's term, the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, which had not been paid to the administration of the State.
"It happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial opportunities for participation, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what the state had to do," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to deliver these resources, he said that the request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando William, to increase efforts to ensure that the interest concerned came as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year ends, they don't give us a penny."
The Court will approve the “digit TV transition” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals on digital is one of the most important developments that the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme Court (VC) has rejected the constitutional claims submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the Presidential Decree, which transfers the so-called “digital television” from 2021 to 2015, since eight votes were not taken to cancel it.
The Minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to move to the digital ground television.
As a result, the constitutional claims claimed by the Senate were rejected by the absence of a qualified majority of the eight votes required for the court to make a constitutional or unconstitutional declaration and remain in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olgay Sanchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional because the regulation of the radio and television programme was a law under the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel) law in violation of the principles of the hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Moon and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
For this reason, both Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to therein regarding the digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the requirement of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive power could not determine the general rules of measures to which the public administration should prepare.
“I also do not believe that if that happened, it would have an impact on the autonomy of the regulator,” and recalled that State policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive power, which has a constitutional mandate, government administration.
The replacement of analogue signals to digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years has resulted in better use of the radio electric spectrum, better quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean deferring the benefits of converting to digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which has not only technical dimensions, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues”.
He said that “the entire system, established by the principle of public economic governance, is required to include a group of authorities, which the Constitution brings together the executive power”.
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to digital broadcasting and had done so through the executive, despite the existence of narrow technical institutions.
It could not be concluded that the Government, in adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affected the competence of the Congress, ensured, in the administrative sphere, compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoacana, analyze the possibility of counting the voice.
According to the PRRA, the difference between the first and the second seats of the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the 879 votes of the total number of 6.074 protocols.
The possibility of counting “voice for voice” is real with regard to the election process in Michoacana this year, where, according to the preliminary results of the elections programme (PRSP), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 from the total number of 6.074 protocols.
In the light of this, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacana (IMM), Maria de Los Angeles Lyanderal Saragosa, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps approved a set of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law Act, since the State Congress approved reforms shortly before the legal date for their entry into force in the electoral process, and Governor Leonardo Yeara Rangel did not include its publication within the time frame set out in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (SSC) decided on the constitutional claim submitted by the local legislative assembly and referred to the “inactive and illegal” vote of the State representative on constitutional reform, since he was not entitled to “decision or support”.
In an interview on the possibility of a voice “voice”, Maria de los Angeles Lyanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles, the General Council of the FMS would be able to present a partial or full count of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, partial recosting of one or more electoral umreas may be made on conditions that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no record of voting and counting of documents in the Urine or not in the chairperson; or where there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the general recosting of votes in all Urnas in the elections may occur when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged winner candidate and those who have obtained a second seat in the vote is less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from a party representative and/or a coalition that has made the second of the candidates.
The general recosting of votes will also be made if, at the end of the usual calculation, the difference between the winner and the second-level candidate is less than or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate has taken the second place in the event that the electoral umbrella that has been taken into account at partial recosting will be excluded.
It is worth noting that there are elections in Morelia where, according to PRRA, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, not even considering 129 votes of the total number of 923.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, confirming the family.
The remains of the pilot Felippe Basio Cortez arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday night; on Monday, an inspection and a calm Mass was conducted.
According to the family, the colonel’s last will was that his ashes should be dispersed in the mountains of Sapalina.
Following the condolences extended to other people who had died in the disaster, the Basio Cortez family returned to the capital of Coauila on board the Mexican Air Force, and the most closest people visited the ceremony in Kampo Marta.
During the afternoon, the colonel’s ashes arrived at a chaplain located at Nazario Ortiz García, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he undertook a study of the Santilo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and a football team who was a member of Felipe Basio during secondary school.
"His desire was to return to Saltillo, and his ashes were scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always said it to his family and friends," is what Sandra Cortez Basio, the pilot sister.
In her opinion, the colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, and she believed that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son, and a loving brother who was loyal to his family."
Felipe Cortés Bassio, a very young man, left the city of Saltillo to go to the Aviation College in Sapopan, Khalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he had a head circling even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of being a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as long as he was the only one who came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to greet him when he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
He recalls that even when he was seven years old, he traveled to Sapopan to the certifying credentials of his relative, so he knows that his uncle was dead by doing what he loved most in life — by managing the plane.
He's being guided to the last way
Felippe Cortés Bassio, headed by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, people from the village and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo Technological High School, in which he studied in 1985 and made progress in both learning and sports, took him on the last way.
Basio Cortez had recently died when the helicopter he managed had been broken, together with the Registrar of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortez (created), the resident of Saltillo, arrived to be transferred to the funeral office of the Mexican Air Force, headed by Major James Martínez, to the training school espanad, where his family had already awaited him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife, Christine, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned on NL Caderate Farm
A few hours before the detection of the military authorities, 11 persons were shown in the media who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a check-up shot at the abandoned farm in the municipality of Caderate Jiménez, Nouevo Leon.
The discovery was found 1.5 kilometres of the Kaderate highway towards Santiago, a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that the gate was opened in a village house with a wall painted in a beef and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three feet [3 m], they discovered the bodies of three people, they immediately gave the relevant authorities a knowledge.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow shirt with black jeans, with no shoes, and there was another man in a white shirt next to him.
Almost one meter was the body of another man, in a red shirt, and in blue jeans.
All three were lying in their faces down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere because there was no guilla.
At the fence of the village house, there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group of another and there are several bullet holes in the gate.
11 caught in Caderate
The Ministry of National Security has submitted 11 persons, including minors, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Caderate and who are accused of abductions, murders, “fraids” and secret graves.
According to the information published, eight people were arrested in Los Alvero colony on 11 November, while one person who had been hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, requiring a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
Another event occurred on 12 November at 6 p.m., the military personnel patrolled the village of Old Rancho in Caderate when they saw a car with two men in the cabin.
By stopping them and carrying out the inspection, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds of ammunition.
Later, after these statements, on 13 November, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Jauda, who, upon seeing the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret graves in Heneral Teran, Hin and Kaderate municipalities.
A new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face the crisis that jeopardizes the economic catastrophe.
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present a new Government that will face the crisis that jeopardizes Italy ' s economic catastrophe and damages the whole Eurozone.
The statement from the Presidential Palace stated that Monty, nominated on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President George Napolitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrates, although it is not clear when the new executive authority will take its position.
Monty said that he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
“I wish to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get out of this difficult period,” said the former European Commissioner to the reporters.
Monty did not expressly say that he was able to form the Government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"Structural is now well defined," he said.
Monty has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less conventional, since Italy has fought a political and financial crisis that has brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, under the leadership of the former European Commissioner of Monty, should approve the rigid savings package required by European leaders in order to restore confidence in Italy.
As a result of pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have set revenues from Italy ' s BTP bonds for 10 years more than 7 per cent, at which Greece and Ireland have had to save.
Emma Marcegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Emma employers, told reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance of Italy to get out of this critical situation.
The Monty chances for success were largely based on the support of the LDP party Sylvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts should lead to a good outcome," said reporters Angelino Alphano, Secretary of the centrist-right party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because to date many of its members have opposed the Government majority of the Technocrites that form Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Monty Government must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that will probably be unpopular reforms of rigid economy.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased pressure to warn that Monty’s failure could be a disaster.
Monty began on Monday consultations with political parties, alliances and business groups, as well as youth and women ' s organizations.
He'll finish his meeting by Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short break at the end of the week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italy's debts had now reached critical levels against the backdrop of uncertainty as to whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
The saving of Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern financial defenders of the eurozone.
Monty said that his Government would exist prior to the next 2013 elections, despite widespread projections that policies would only allow him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said that he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insist that it should be drawn up only from technical experts, a sign of their displeasure that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that the mutual mistrust and dissent of parties made it more difficult to try to include political figures.
Spaniards have more gambling experience than Ticos
Of the 22 players reported in Spain, 10 have already played 50 international matches.
Costa Rica had only one of the 22 declared players to play 50 matches.
The low contrast with Costa Rica by comparing 22 players caused by both countries to a communal match today at the National Stadium in San José at 3:05.
While the world and Europe champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rating, have a whole list of class A selection games, Tricolour has only the advocate of Michael Uman as the only one who has spent 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) at the Romel Fernandez Stadium.
Spanish footballers, playing the League of All Stars and Strong English League Clubs, have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in European Cups and the League of Champions.
To that end, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish van in the complex qualifications of the Euro or the World Championship.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCAAF, which is considered to be the lowest in FIFA.
We see that it is headed by a list in the Spanish collecting holkiper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (the matz 0-1 in London) repeated the record of Andona Subisareta ex-Golkyper, with 126 international matches.
Cassillas will play against Tricolar today and set a new record of 127 international matches for Spain.
Havi Hernández, Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Kassilias and Havi were recognized as the best last week of UEFA, along with another Iberian team player, Subisareta, with 126 matches and Shalke Raul Gonzales bomber from 102.
It's almost close to 100 Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Havi Alonso follows them with 91, Fernando Torres, David Villa and Serhio Ramos, both with 81, Andres Injesta from 62, Sesk Fabregas from 61 and David Silva from 53.
Costa Rica, near Mikhael Umana, left-hand Junior Dias, with 48 matches, and Brian Ruis bomber, from 45.
Next, only five of them crossed the line of 30 games: Kaylor Nawas from 31, Randall Asofeif from 32, Michael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Hernández from 36 and José Luis Lopes from 35.
We're left.
More than 30 matches in Spain at Gérard Pike (37), Serhio Busketsa (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
There's Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks from 26, Gabriel Budilja from 25 and Roy Muri from 23.
The remaining ones didn't get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two games, Victor Bolivar has only one in Costa Rica, Olman Wargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spanish leader David Villa with 50 heads followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis became the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernández and three times as much as Roy Muri and Parks.
Quintet included the country in a tour of 20 years of career
A visit to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exceptional interview by Viva, Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It was over 20 years of expectation, but the group says that it is also a dream that has become a reality to play in that country.
This was an allegation of the Basist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The group is located in South America as a tour of 20 years of work and will make its only stop in Central America on Sunday, 20.
On that day, they will attend the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the Los Angeles The X team and the Las Robertas local group.
It's an excerpt of a conversation, whose full deciphering is available online at The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, this is the dream that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A visit to Costa Rica is a dream for us, too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking about it because there's some loyalty to the group; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What will you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for having been with us all these years.
We took almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting for so long, and we regret that we took so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, view it as the largest show of the year.
Does that add some tension to your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have played in the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great show in São Paulo, and we hope that this has led us into the form of this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love Serfing and jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and its Serfing waves?
We have a lot of sergeants, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go to the Serfings in Costa Rica and in Nicaragua, and in Mexico, that's a great place for the Serfing, that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you could say that you made great shows with a lot of songs.
What'd you plan for the Costa Rican presentation?
Since we've never played there before, we don't have any restrictions on what we can do.
We'll try to make a better show of possible songs with a wide range of songs; we'll try to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think partly that's because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tonus and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we could forget.
It makes the show more interesting to us and so I think it makes it more interesting to people.
This tour is 20 years of career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First, I think none of us ever imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We rejoice in our luck, and we are deeply encouraged by the fact that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're happy to travel around the world where we always wanted to go.
It's a very good thing for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the border bloom?
It has always been an honour to be part of this group of great groups.
We're good friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, one group comes from one city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in one city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Sietle group.
I'm still playing with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with all of them and for us to be part of the sound of Seattle that had been produced.
It's also very strange that a group like yours stays together in the same composition so long.
Yes, the four of us were 21 years old together, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, that it was much longer in itself than many groups existed.
First, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and secondly, we're taking care of others.
We are all very close friends, and we have also opened musical roads that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not be better.
Your view of the word was not easy; but your success made it possible for you to do whatever you wanted.
How do you balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to balance.
We care not to be too long on the tour because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember people here for music, it reminds you that you should respect music and what you've done without choosing to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really cares about.
What do you remember about your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We were a group of almost three years, and we didn't release any album until Andy died.
It's been a lot of disappointment because it's been so long, and the most important thing that we're still close friends with Bruce (Ferрвеzer) and Graham (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think of an incredible person who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of other things.
It was a great man, and we miss him.
Las Robertas local group will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose it to open it?
Yeah, the producers sent us a few videos, and this was a group that we liked most, so we're eager to see that Las Robertas can offer us a hard time, and that must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words at Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
That's the question of Eddie Wedder, so I don't know.
He sings her, and I think he's using the first thing he gets in his head.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There are so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Giser Butler, John Entville, C.J. Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of the border, even though he was no longer fashioned?
I think we all feel some kind of undivided from the boundary.
When I think of him, he reminds me of the groups that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth listening, and teams like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
At first, your music was more gloomy, and now it's become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, because, I think there's a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very dark, though they might sound a little positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up and you've had some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, these things start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that to me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create gloomy music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
Ex-President Alberto Fuhimori was hospitalized on Tuesday at the State Hospital, for a muscular loss survey, which occurs in his legs, reported to his family doctor.
Fuhimori, 72 years old, sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for human rights violations committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which has been operated four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal doctor, told the N television channel that Fuhimori will be examined three days at the National Institute for Non-oplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Hagina said that in his view, Fuhimori should be a candidate for humanitarian pardon; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He carried four operations on speech cancer, lost 18 pounds [18 kg] weight, adding other diseases such as strong erosive gastrit, pancreas bones, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and blood transfusions in his legs, listed the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, at the National Police Office for Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years ' imprisonment for the killing of 25 persons by the forces of destruction of the army, which operated secretly during the first years of his administration.
Mushik is going to Mexico to strengthen political linkages
The official delegation, chaired by President Uruguay José Muhika and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on the political challenges of the region.
Mukika will meet on the following Wednesday with her Mexican colleague, Felipe Calderon, the most important item of the extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, according to the timetable published by the Uruguay leadership.
The two Presidents ' meeting in Guadalahar City will be “a conducive to sharing information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika seeks support for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkosi, Nikolas Sarkozi, incorporated the South American country in a tax sheet at the G20 meeting in Kann, France.
In his speech, Sarkozi threatened to remove from the international community those countries that remained tax harbours, a statement that protested Uruguay and revoked his ambassador to consult the European country.
Mexico has been chairing a group of the most highly developed and developing countries since November in G20 and has, in fact, a tax exchange agreement with the South American country since January this year to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to expedite the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to leave this grey list of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, drawn from countries that do not enjoy international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 the Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which has increased trade across two countries.
The wet water supply will become three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Pić from the evil paws of Bozer, but never before did it in three dimensions: at "Super Mario 3D Land" he'll fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
A publication that will appear at shops around the world this month has been created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows for three measurements without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero to tell you how stereoscopes will work without points," said the head of the Nintendo Press Service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed under this platform", because until now successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adapting existing games.
The representative of Nintendo stated that, despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that allowed for a fast and mobile game.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "Simplified" to attract less experienced users.
One day, most experts will go "by the second round" to the levels of the game, which are this time more complex.
In addition, users can choose in real time between “D aggressive” or the one that affects only the depth of action, but on which they need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and “do not give in to optical illusions”.
This incursion by Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the return of the hero to the portable console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo twinkles the fans of the series and repeats the successful formula of the previous games, the water supplyer and the ostairs need to go through dangerous mined platforms to release Princess Pić.
However, the player will find new movements, decorations, suits and enemies, as well as Luigi's playing.
Colom guarantees Portilla extradition to the United States
President Alvaro Colom said on Tuesday that the Alfonso Portillo extradition process had begun to respond in the United States for a laundering plot of $70 million.
This is the end of the process at which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo in order to judge him there.
At the press conference, Colom said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive authorities, bearing in mind that the court of first instance had already signed extradition.
He argued that, during his mandate, he did not “take hands” to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Together with Portilla Serhio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estradez, both for drug sale.
What Colom showed the execution of the process after all legal and constitutional courts had been exhausted to prosecute the ex-heads of the State from 2000 to 2004.
Pursuant to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CS), Portilla will be extradited once with a decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of the cost of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential period, which was a pre-extradition process, but the Ministry of Public Relations filed an appeal and again opened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The outcome of the first 25 years of the social support organization, Trinijove, is important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion have helped to overcome the difficult situations during this fourth century.
More than a hundred jobs created for this social group should be added.
The Yearbook provided an opportunity for a ceremony held at the Fabra I Coats office, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared near Trinity Velia in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or vulnerable to marginalization.
The commemoration last night in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that worked with the association during those 25 years.
The different political perception during the elections showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
Following the President of the General Assembly, Arthur Masa and his predecessor, Hordie Pukhol, an ex-consultant of Socialist education, Ernest Maragal, and ex-Leutenant mayor and current eco-socialist, member of the municipal council of Rickard Goma.
At Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, Josep Lewis Cleris and SEO Social Workers La Caixa, Hame Lanaspa, also appeared.
He said that Trinijove had emerged in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but he added that the work done so far was “a good base”.
The President cited Trinijove as an example of the struggle against bad circumstances and the inspiration of hardship people.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work done by it," he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, evacuated
11 of the 13 floors of the Balmez Street building, 51 were occupied by the seizures.
12 occupants left the building yesterday no fight
It seems that the nightmare of neighbors living in the 51 - street house of Balmes came to an end.
Twelve people left the building voluntarily at noon yesterday, where they illegally occupied and organized mass parties that irritated neighbours by court decision without police interference.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the repetition of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a check-up here," said the manager.
The squitters that captured 11 out of 13 floors of the building, the rest settled, all electrical and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of different kinds, especially banks from alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a mass party site that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Immediately behind the building is the nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, reported to Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The owner of the club says that the invaders of the building brought her into an unfair competition because they sold drinks for three euros, while at a club for ten.
In addition, the discotch owner had to respond to the noise complaints of the neighbors, although she noted that the noise was caused not by the visitors to the club, but by the Squot residents and, above all, by those who had attended the parties that had been organized there, the frequency and intensity of which had increased, as the disastrous neighbours said.
The owner of the club said that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months he had been “forgiving ” her rental.
The City Police also confirmed that more complaints had been received from neighbours over the past weeks.
The President of the Municipal Group of PP, adviser Alberto Fernand Dias, demanded, last week, “to evacuate the building immediately in order to address and deteriorate coexistence and common spirit problems of neighbours”.
The popular leader explained that until summer, only one floor of the building was busy, but in the last few months the squitters invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them had been hacked.
In that sense, he added that “to put an end to impunity and to resist the uncultivation of the building”.
So, yesterday the police evacuated the building to Nou Barris.
At 15:30, the police left Montral, 35 after receiving a call from a neighbour, who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or Mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a competition after the contests for contributions
The Municipal Contest for 16 doors resumed the debate on the role of Colserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the upturn of the Barcelona Capital Corporation (SSC), the Administration printed promo-lists for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of Barcelona’s capital.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the UK, in 1987 the park again took place in the mind of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that were not in the north-south but up (hora) to the bottom (sea).
The position of the Colserol as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yelloutton, with the wild cabane as the bear of Joga.
That was so until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colzerol.
Under the gate is the idea of the park, of course.
Either that, or someone wants to put the gate on the field.
Is there one question: Colserola or a park or a mountain?
Competition and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are the subject of discussion among all Barcelona architects.
This is hardly the most recurring subject discussed when two members of this clan recognize each other in an elevator.
This fact leads to one of the few coincidences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who attended.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: The competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss “the front side of the mountain” when Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
"It's important to assume that the largest Barcelona park is a beach.
Among other things, because of its excellent accessibility.
"Colserola is more complex," says an architect whose headline of the Colserol's gate contains a "silver trap," and we should not think of them as "as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we should act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, described the proposal as “intellectual task” with “some dangers”.
Risks arising from “independence of public space prediction” following the experience of the 80-x, which ended at the “lebdin songs” Forum.
The first fear is the limitation of the boundaries where you can build.
“Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step”, is meant, the transition.
“We must think of new urban planning instruments, because the current [for the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to a real disaster.”
More closely, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserol Valley "may be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a pure topographic question.
Modelo recalls that there is already a work done outside Calserola, which is "not to skip past ears," although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor offers his profession to enter the project "from the outset."
And, moreover, it is understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows the architects to engage in the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is the one that should lead the interdisciplinary teams (“success”), which is to be created, “Architarians must be only a tool”.
The Byona suggests that the answer to the question that the name of this part is made up, because the rules of the competition do not contain a general kind of Colserola: “16 retreats have been announced,” he says, “in the meaning of the sea groves, but there is no long-term reading here to see and understand the area as a whole.”
This has led at least him to decide on 16 contests.
On the other hand, a project for one gate can be intersected by programme and definition with an architect's project for neighbouring gates.
In your view, the Council is expected to guarantee that the strip directly above Rhonda de Dalt should provide a full area equipped for a smooth transition between town and green.
Kazino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released.
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino judicial representative pardoned the brother of Mayor Monterrey in the proceedings against him on the charge of extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be free after the legal representative of Red Casino extended forgiveness to the Second Criminal District Court, which is conducting a trial of extortion against the brother of Mayor Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Serhio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonahs allegedly required him to pay his economic contribution to allow Monterrey authorities to operate secretly in a game house.
After a public conviction, the Public Attorney General opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor and was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days on 2 September.
After four hours before an agent of the State Ministry of Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the capital of the State.
It stayed 49 days in this place, following the order of the second order prohibiting movement after the prosecutor had expelled the bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to Kaderate for a semi-million pesos extortion from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours there in prison with the average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving in the municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garz.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, the evidence of Yonas ' s guilt, such as the levy of 1.5 million pesos from the tugmakers in exchange for authorization of the operation, was sufficient.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could gain freedom in the next hours.
During the trial, the public prosecutor before the court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gómez whether he had reimbursed the damage and who of the partners in the gambling house would grant pardon, although the lawyer had tried not to make the name.
Based on the records of 197/2011, legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and thereafter no declaration of the process that had been planned against him; no reparation and punishment would be required.
Following the hearing of the legal representative of the tractors, almost at 15:50, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court officer, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicholas municipality prison in Garza to report to Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of an immediate release order signed by a judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacomé describes the details of the catastrophe where the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Blake, died, and seven others.
The Minister of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results of the accident, during which the Minister of the Interior, Francisco Black Mora, and seven others, had killed, showed that the helicopter had directly hit the ground in a state of complete integrity, without attempts by the pilot to take an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft ascended, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that seem to show that the ship had several contacts with the land, wings contacted trees 25 meters [25 meters] where the vehicle lost the fluse."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, meeting the requirements for transport of persons.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the existence of parts on the ground.
“The study reported that there were no components of the vessel elsewhere, and the impact occurred in a structural integrity state.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the requirements for the transport of passengers.
The earth in this place has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At this point, the Secretary said, the key was to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
In the meantime, Gilberto Lopes Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the Presidential helicopter was headed at cruiser speed and that it was on a soft lifting ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the usual flight manoeuvre at the time of the blow," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hacomé, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aviation rules, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, which means that the team must have a visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for flight when the aircraft headed to the border area between the city of Mexico and the State of Mexico, where the cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of cloud conditions, the team sought a zone of less height and greater visibility in the Kuernawaka Valley.
The place of the blow.
The impact coordinates and the latest recording from the radar of the aircraft are likely to be the same before the impact of the loss of control or change of direction.
The scattered raids on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and side line.
The fragmentation of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter had encountered the land in structural integrity.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were found:
In the zone of catastrophe, unsubstantiated evidence remains in the wrecks of a ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies show that multiple contacts with land could be made.
During the field work, pieces of air vessel were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the ground has a slope of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed on the road.
The information contains facts that seem to show that the helicopter could have had several clashes with the land.
After a thorough study in more territory than the marked zone near the location where the accident occurred, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforced the assumption that the impact had occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces the obesity gene search program
Social protection is headed by a study to find a gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) announced that it was conducting a study to detect the obesity gene from children and young people, which had been called the “Genetic Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents” protocol, which would provide an estimate of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the Head of the Medical Research Unit of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the twenty-first century, Miguel Cruz Lopes explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been gathered.
This team is assisted by specialists and graduates from the National Institute of Health of the NIPH and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnology Institute (NPI).
The study invites the population (reported or not) to participate in the research sporting centres of MSSI in the Valley of Mexico City, where each Saturday, from 8:00 a.m., child-friendly tests will be conducted.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to be held at a sports centre in Cuautémoca, west of Mexico City, and since October 8, the activities were held at a sports centre in Nesaualcouatl, Mexico City, at the east of Mexico City.
After the target of between 500 and 600 children is reached, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (Yug Mexico) and finally at the Morellos Sport Centre (Sovereign Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of the study was to understand the components and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On 14 November, the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated, and the main objective will be to collect three thousand children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with permission of parents and under their supervision to fill individual feeding questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical activity and history of family inheritance diseases in order to avoid risk factors leading to diseases such as diabetes or renal deficiencies.
He explained that the anthropometric measurements of all participants would be carried out on Saturday (weight, growth and coverage of the talis), the measurement of blood pressure and the level of glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genes related to child obesity).
Cruc López said that the study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in the weight of children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that only six years of growth had occurred: 77 per cent of boys suffered from obesity in the case of girls; 47 per cent in the case of overweight, there has also been a significant increase,” said MSSI expert.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the population was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He reported that an average Mexican is a 65 per cent descendant of American Indians, a 30 per cent descendant of Europeans and a five per cent descendant of Africans, and this condition affects genes related to diabetes and overweight.
He explained that mainly the result of the genetics of obesity is the inability of the organism to burn the excess of energy we consume (calories), and it is postponed as fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit to participants, which could identify whether they had any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark warehouses on the neck (acants) and forearms means the likelihood of a violation of metabolism and even a predecessor.
All confidentiality is sought, and the doctors give it in writing to the parents to whom they explain all the measurements and changes in lifestyles to be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there were three main reasons for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: sitting lifestyles, or a lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using small distance transport instead of walking.
This is also due to the high consumption of calories, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and hydrocarbons (tamal, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a large content of fats and proteins and genetic prevalence analysed in the programme.
UNAM Asphalt can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of best-quality, sustainable to environmental impacts and temperatures.
If traffic signals were given attention, some 200,000 pits would have to be repaired for each rainy season in the capital area in Mexico City, says Rafael Errér Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the construction and maintenance of asphalated road covers were to be streamlined, the number of pits could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lectures, the Technological View of the Pits read in the International Year of Chemistry reports that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified battle for the production of a mixture that is close to a bitumen but with the best resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Erréra Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather was extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve road quality and therefore to resist pit education.
He explained that the bitumen, the most heavy part of oil, is the sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of them the high molecular mass called asphaltens, and others the low molecular mass called elbows, which together provide road covers its characteristic limb - voltage behavior.
The viscostrous behavior of the battleum is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees, it behaves like liquid at 120 degrees of viscosity very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it maintains almost a solid state, while at very low temperatures it becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to the asphalt is not permanent but is changing during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
Scientist chimpaka observed that the streets of Mexico City were largely covered with flexible covers, which consisted of six layers of material, of which the last three included a bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones dumped into a battle and then squeezed.
Every stone that is made up of this coat, he said, was loaded into the battle.
When driving vehicles and applying efforts, this helps the force to be very well distributed on road cover.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be distributed even better, said a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt coating, he added, the last layer, called the layer of wear made of a small stone, in fact sand also loaded into asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels, it must have more resistance than the asphalt cover and provide a road trail.
As part of the road surface that will receive and disseminate these efforts, the layer of wear also requires adequate thickness and the material from which it is prepared should be taken into account.
The weather, especially the humidity and temperature overlap, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the state of asphalt.
When the ground is raw, the water enters the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it makes all layers of coating soften and, hence, the formation of the pit.
In the formation of the pits, he said, the first was the deterioration layer and only then affected the bitumen, but the damage did not occur instantly, which should be given attention to the first signs of ongoing repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport load was another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of surface should always be related to transport loads and it was necessary to ensure that this requirement was met in order to prevent the frequent appearance of eggs.
Rafael Errera said that much still needed to be studied and made, for example, bitumen emulsions that were already on the market in other countries and even helped to make pits easily and without high temperatures.
What did the Valle need to do to become a new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the reasons that prevented Serne Meline Ramirez from obtaining the crown of Ms. Colombia.
The representative of Valle received the title of the princess 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only been willing to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna was to be satisfied with the winners' symposium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her new princess of Colombia.
Based on the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where the Mission of the Atlantic won the crown and scepter, the Department has 14 titled Princess, and Melina joins the Legion of Valle del Cauca, who were close to the crown, but who were declared princesss, including Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Belina Ayal (1979), Lauré Alvares (1981), Rose Mary Alvarez (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Songsuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Rome (1993), Hisee Alhore Garcez (2000), Katalina Hiráldo (2007), Stephanie Harcez Alhure (2008).
The question that many now pose:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the presentations showed that she had everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just so she was elected by the Queen of the Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue version, the titles of the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who were given the crowns of Miss Columbus.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to award her the title of the First Princess was that she could not answer the question, "What book characterizes you and why?" asked by Martin Murille Gómez of the literature society.
She replied to the questioning:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I definitely think that the book that characterizes my childhood is a little Prince, a pretty deep book.
Today, I read "Precise and Punishment," this is a masterpiece of world literature that we all should read; also at this point I read the book Irina Nemirova, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "Blood Jare."
A reply that did not like the jury because of the term “cultivation” and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted described it.
But after the ceremony, Melinah said that she was calm and satisfied with her outcome, "A wise man, what is going to happen."
And you're all, please, reading a little bit, "Small Prince" is a great book."
Among the sounding hypothesis, Valle burned out of favoritism.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was preferred to be met with ovations, and she was a candidate who had received all the pre-primary awards (the Ostera Curriculum, the audience's vote for the best national suit, and Queen-Matha), "that sparked the zeal of other candidates, caused stress on the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage."
This was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on the beach of Hilton and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although it seemed certain, it was notable that it lacked the energy and energy that the representatives of Magdalene and the Atlantic demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the "How Homes" programme on the RCN canal, said that the fact that Milena was called the Princess means that a candidate who wins more rewards during the competition does not become a queen."
In addition, the representative of Valle has recently avoided contact with the press, and that was not the right thing to do.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Congress of Beauty.
That's why two days before the election, a member of the International Jury, Lucy Dotti, said that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
“One beauty is not enough for Ms. Colombia, but we must look not only at the outward appearance, but also focus on public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects,” she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Valle sinned with defects on berries and fibrosis that were seen on her belly, but that was controversial, as the jury emphasized her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her better body, good food and responsible physical work.
Consultant King Jorge Hernan Orosco observes that Melina had not the best body, which was better, but the fibrosis problems on my belly that were not very visible to me forced her to lose the glass on the last day.
Meanwhile, Guido Oyos, a journalist from the Cromos magazine, believes that the error of the representative of Valé de Cauca was that she had been subjected to surgical intervention.
"Operations are good, but Valle's representative doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize that was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Competition, the vicious prediction took place last night, saying that it was a dude whose Rymundo gave Melina as compensation for having lost her pleasure in gaining a crown.
That is, or not, the fact that Melina is now having a year of government, not as queen, but as a princess, the position that enables her to represent Colombia at a international competition that has been directly designated by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it would be a history of one of the queens who, despite her excellent presentation at Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A criminal from Kali came into history as a man who confirmed Alfonso Cano's death.
The work of these employees is key.
On 4 November, the criminal of the CTI Kali came into history as a man who confirmed the identity of FARC head Alfonso Cano in comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working in the CTI this week, Elizare González, a man from Puerto Tehad, who had spent 21 years in judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choko, where he often had to cross more than five days through the jungle to reach the places where bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and, after the courses were completed, he became a criminalist specialist in the field of skin training, i.e. hand and tuna.
Elizare was told to take no more than three days to carry out a human operation known as Alfonso Cano during the week.
Something great's coming.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Cauca to Palmira.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten images of Guillermo Leon Sáens.
However, when he came with the research team to the place where the body was located, he did not identify him on the outside; he was very different from what the media showed.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and much worse.
But the prints don't lie.
Using an enlarged glass, ink, shovel, and flashlight, Elizare compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the pictures.
His eyes weren't down; it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinson, that he was the leader of the RASC
Searching for fingerprints
For a dactiloscope specialist, Sijin from Kali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizarez González for a press conference on the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dactiloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, it can play a key role in the disclosure of crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, dactiloscopy experts are involved in investigations into crimes such as theft and murder and identify detainees.
When detained, many criminals have false certificates or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and we search for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of theft, he had to take away a piece of the wall of the house because the thief had to hold his hands to get a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are hard to work because they are not convenient surfaces to take off the prints, but in this case we can take a picture of the whole palm and identify the perpetrator who took part in a number of thefts," he says.
Printing also helps to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man with bottles from a liker around him was found.
In the course of the investigation, it was found that a relative could have been suspected of committing an offence and that the fingerprints on the bottle were actually matched.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A CTI dactiloscopy specialist explained that a chemical or physical reagent is being used in places where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Thereafter, prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or entered into the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of Colombians missing," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it was not all as shown in the CSI television program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves the prints on you.
However, if possible, a comparison shall be made.
“Agrieved people” challenge the New York authorities
Hundreds of protesters crashed the camp in front of Zukkotti Square.
Part of the protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the area and went to the park nearby.
The members of the Wall Street Foundation left the New York authorities on Tuesday when they tried to get back, under the protection of the order, to Manhattan area, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to capture another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters accumulated at the Zukotti area, where they wanted to be, thanks to a judicial order that allowed “agrieved people” to break the camp into the area while the other part of the movement responded to the dispersion by taking the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were carried out
"Our idea is that since the court does not allow us to break the camp in the area, we will break the camp somewhere else and continue the judicial struggle to return to Zucotty and through peaceful sitting strikes and demonstrations," said Mark Brey, one of the representatives of the "Falk Wall Street" movement.
Brey explained that the response of “retaliated people” to the evacuation of the tentary town, which was ordered by the mayor of New York by Michael Bloomberg, had come to court, where Judge Lucy Billings had issued a ruling prohibiting forced evacuation from the area and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the “disgrieved people” have begun to capture a new park located at the merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Six Avenue, near the entry into Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey and is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least an hour they could take up this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't call the exact number, but he told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The Organization is confident that several hundred people were standing with tents at the place where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to show support to the members of the movement in an attempt to act as mediator in police negotiations.
In the meantime, the Zukotti area, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a trial appointed for this Tuesday, which will address the legality of today's morning dispersion of protesters.
Some of the protesters who were sent there carried and distributed at the same time copies of the judgement and even gave copies to police officers guarding the area, resulting in “some small clashes”, said Bray, who claimed that some police officers had beaten demonstrators.
The Judicial Order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of the Wall Street movement and to compel them to comply with the “laws issued after the capture began, or to prohibit demonstrators from re-accessing access to the park with stores and other property used earlier”.
The Mayor of Bloomberg told the reporters that the city had suspended the opening of the public space and the demonstrators had been informed, but local laws did not allow them to reopen tent stores and bedroom bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of the protesters from the Zukotti area at dawn, the operation during which some 200 arrests were carried out, and the decision was made because the protesters “had violated the law”.
Bloomberg said that he ordered the clearance of the area because it was “the place where people came to protest, not to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm other people”, because “some enterprises had been threatened” and neighbors feared “for deteriorating the quality of life”.
The evacuation conducted this morning was disgusting and showed that Bloomberg was more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” added a representative of the movement who condemned the mayor for “a lack of respect for freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for Wall Street also indicated that they intended to organize “border acts” on Thursday in cooperation with public organizations and trade unions in order to recall the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be Deva Maria in the special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bubble and other prominent Canadians, it will appear on the television program “Rodship of Russell Peters” on December 1.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen in the "Big Reconstruction", a rescue officer at Malibu Saviors, Banny in Pleiboy, a rock musical wife, Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model will be Deva Maria on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
The CTV private telecommunications announced today that Anderson, together with the Crowner, Michael Buble, and other prominent Canadians, would appear on the "Rodship of Russell Peters" on December 1, in the role of Mary.
The CTV presented a television show today in which Anderson, also known for the Internet-wide home pornographic video, with her husband, Tommy Lee drummer, appears dressed like Deva Maria, holding a doll that portrays Jesus.
In this stage, Peters, a famous Canadian Indian comic, who recently acted as the leader of the tour of "My cruel torpedo of truth" by Charlie Shina, appears to be Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian CTV singer, who married in Buenos Aires at the Argentine model of Luisian Lopilato and who also knows the interpretation in scandals, participates in the special CTV Christmas show.
Recently, Bubble called the American Kim Kardashian "suka" at one of his concerts in New York City.
Japan recovered from the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the fall that began in March
Since March last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has caused a nuclear crisis, a terrible catastrophe that has been carried out by the Country of the rising sun since the Second World War
According to the Government of Tokyo, material losses amounted to $300,000 million — a blow that seems to pass despite the difficult world situation.
After three consecutive quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September have clearly helped to shift the page: GDP has increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and 6 per cent in annual calculations.
The registered in the second quarter, the financial year for the Japanese beginning in March 2012, also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
Renaissance may be partly explained by the rebirth of the purchase of machine equipment to rehabilitate areas devastated by earthquake and the aftermath of the tsunami.
In fact, companies have increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a reduction of 0.9 per cent of the capital costs observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Kenyan momentum, which calls for the use of the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan has arose mainly through the development of household consumption, which now stands at 60 per cent of Japanese GDP.
This figure has increased by 1 per cent as a result of increased cars, travel and recreation costs.
Cleimo yen
Tokyo provided an internal market when the yen, Japanese currency, became one of the "refuge-escapes" chosen by investors who wanted to eliminate the debt crisis in the euro zone and negative projections about the United States, a privilege that would give a stone to exporting companies.
In stronger currencies, products are expensive overseas, which is a serious blow to the country whose economic rate is determined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the Yen in their low rates from July to September.
While markets continue to siege the EU peripheral countries, the Government of Esikhico Noda does not decrease vigilance.
We must be attentive to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the dramatic increase in yen, said yesterday, the Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furuwa.
Indeed, prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic decline in September.
An indicator that predicts breakthroughs in the world economy showed that the main forces are slowing down.
It then fell four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurason even fell below the average value of 100 points after it reached eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens once again give rise to doubts
Papadimos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation.
With the offshore risk and uncertainty awards prevailing in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the labyrinth, which leads to the end of a large European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consent” of the new Transitional Government of Ellad is imposed by the requirements of Brussels rather than by the true belief of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos had warned yesterday that there was no alternatives to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment might not be sufficient for their application, Antonis Samaras, the conservative party leader of the New Democracy, believed that he would not support new measures of strict savings in no case, and reiterated his demand for new elections on 19 February.
The main task of the Government was to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that would end tomorrow with the confidence of the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovation.
However, Samaras' message does not clarify his position: “We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing.”
The leader of the conservatives took a step further in his attitudes regarding the EU and IMF, organizations that should dismalize 8,000 million that were urgently needed to Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, while still disappointed by the effect of the Papandreu referendum's claims in style, repeated yesterday that its demands are unambiguous: it will not resume aid if the new Government and the leaders of the major parties of Greece do not sign the “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible”.
The representative of the Ministry of Economics of Amadeu Altafai said that the troika inspectors could return “only soon” to Athens to discuss with the new Government, “what must be done to pay the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
The Greek club will have enough threads for a while.
Mrs. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope."
The Queen stressed the “core” of Spain with regard to this type of finance
Spain “has taken a prominent place in the world in microfinance”.
The Queen of Sofia reminded us yesterday that over the past two decades the country has become the second largest donor for cooperation instruments, whose “reality”, she said, is that it is a “instrument for social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all mankind based on faith in humankind”.
The Queen opened the Fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valyadolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “perfectly necessary” to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals by 2015 and “in particular with a view to reducing halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is recorded.”
Spain “is still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and to take on this task with “responsibility”, says Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievements that emerged during the summit that will continue until Thursday will “ensure the creation of new capacities and opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women, the “core recipients of these loans”.
There's a lot of accomplishments here and a lot of difficulties that we're facing.
The microcredit summit is not only a dispute area but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty therefore explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and that one hundred million of these households would be removed from the poverty to which they were loaded.
The impulse to the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world "has been on the way that Muhammad Yunus began" stressed Ms. Sofia as "the act of justice and recognition."
And she described the father of the tool as “a spectacular idealist in the universal fight against poverty”, whose work has been known for 15 years since the queen had gone to Bangladesh to study its lending policy on the ground.
A year later, this experience took over the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen continuous development everywhere”, said Her Majesty, whose connection with the project brought her yesterday the title “heads of the family” gathered in Valyadolid “banker of the poor”.
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded by calling on those present to participate in the discussion and to find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jimenez, said that solidarity was a “ethical imperative” for each democratic State.
In that connection, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it was a “permanent commitment”.
Hemines concluded that microcredit implied a “strong and solid course to eradicate poverty”, and now “more than ever” developed Governments should work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to be a victim of cost reductions.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, commended the “success” in giving “confidence” to the people “withdependent to which all the doors are closed” and the mayor of Valyadolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city who “open up their doors in the spirit of solidarity”.
The CDC proposes that the President of Eurocommission be elected by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDF) on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Mercel, who is also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but was created in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the Government's policy is far from as strict as it should be today with Greece and perhaps tomorrow with Italy....
The draft resolution on the chairmanship of the European Commission, which was put forward by the leadership for discussion, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and 10 abstained.
The ovals stood for several minutes, which earned Angel Mercel and several hours later Wolfgang Schoyble, Europhille and the Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is the slogan: the correct response to the crisis is “not less than Europe, but more than Europe”.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, it's time for the breakthrough in Europe.
This may mean changes in the Lisbon Treaty, which make it possible to strengthen the European Union ' s control over the financial policy of the Eurason countries, but that may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote “to give Europe a person”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which evidently belongs to Wolfgang Shabble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree with this decision; Britain is opposed to that, and HDS leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkosi is also opposed.
But the soil is prepared.
Similarly, delegates rejected the overwhelming majority of the proposal to weigh the vote of each member country of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
In an effort to calm the situation in its party, the Chancellor increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kole, but did not seek to influence Congress through the “little” European countries or countries in difficult situations, who like to criticize the “high” Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devoted a whole paragraph to the importance of Hermano-French friendship, Angel Merkel did not mention France.
Just by way.
Remembering that two centuries ago Leipzig became a scene of bloodbath.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Perleonian army.
What is fraud with hospital leaves?
Following cash benefits, the UMP and the Government began attacking hospital leaves.
On 15 November, Nicola Sarkozi will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Family Benefit Distribution Fund and speak on this subject, which has been on occasion since 2007, on the fight against fraud in the area of social benefits.
And in order to help that offense, which emerged from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-to-president campaign, most want to focus on hospital sheets.
The Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private employees in view of budget savings.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the employee who is ill will lose his salary in four days, at a minimum of 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to cause a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will result in savings of Euro280 million.
It will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose one day on public servants without sickness benefit (the public servants still had no waiting to pay the allowance, unlike the three-day expectation of private sector employees).
Now that these issues are discussed, the majority also raises the subject of fraud in view of the abuse of hospital leaves.
Control will become more severe and, in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all your illegal payments”, warned Xavier Bertrand on the RTL channel on Saturday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital leaves.
They have indeed been subject to constant control and political attacks since 2002, which bear fruit.
There is no more people in France than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's take a look at the figures for the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economic Research and Documentation, the daily cost of compensation in 2008 of Euro11.3 million was 5 per cent of the total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were on maternity leave and work accidents and 54 per cent on sickness benefits, representing €6.2,000 million.
And therefore, 2.5 per cent of health-related costs.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to Alma Consulting Group.
Average arithmetic, which covers some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com ' s career management site, found that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French employees interviewed said that they had not taken a single day of hospital.
Another study on health insurance this time states that 37 per cent of hospitals lasted less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent longer.
Comparing these figures with European neighbours, it is clear that French employees are no more inclined to take hospitals than workers of any other country.
A lengthy study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001 the total percentage of absences in France (for health or not) varied between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital leaves is very low compared to the “sere” of employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law since 2002 has resulted in systematic screening of hospitals for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases verified by CNAM, 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term illnesses were “unjustifiable” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly checked hospital leaves, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “unreasonable or unfounded”, which is equivalent to 132,000.
In total, 169,000 cases were “unfounded” for several million employees receiving hospital leaves.
Numbers that show very few cases compared to, for example, the employment gray.
According to the UMP Dominique Tyan, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to between 9 million and 15,000 million euros of under-budgeted income per year, exceeding the total cost of daily compensation and thus infinitely higher than fraud losses.
Papadimos: Greece should follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos stated in Parliament, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition Government were not sufficient to carry out that task.
“To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme,” said the head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the confidence of Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euroson Summit on 27 October should be the “principal task” of the new Government, since the country ' s presence in Eurozone ' is at stake, he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos predicts a reduction in the country ' s budget deficit “approximately 9 per cent” of GDP by the end of the year, with 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects the new Government ' s measures
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for measures already taken to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further measures of strict economy.
"We won't vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with the members of his party of New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating costs, but also with his rejection of any course that impeded the recovery of the economy.
Ollie Renu, a European commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary loan of €8,000 million without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize eutanasia and suicide with foreign assistance, states the Committee of Experts
Canadians are denied death, affirmed in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee argues that the Government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, without considering cancer.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9 percent of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code in order to permit suicide with foreign assistance and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient may be considered competent to take such a decision.
For the first time, experts refer to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada is in 10 places, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people fear to argue about death”.
Due to medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, and experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6 per cent of them end with death in the hospital.
The highest country rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of the deaths occur in the hospital.
On a sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report conclude that it is contrary to the Federal Government's position that they have already stated that they do not wish to change anything in the criminal code with respect to euthanasia and suicide with foreign assistance.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such acts have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization has involved abuses of use, that is, the exercise of euthanasia or suicide with foreign assistance against people who cannot or do not wish to make such a decision.
On the contrary, during the news conference, Joselin Downi, who submitted the report, most of these cases were in countries where Euthanasia and suicide had not been legalized.
Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
Self - murder is practised in Canada, where it is evidently illegal, explains Joselin Downy.
Euthanasia Canadians
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate eutanasia, because, according to annous Reid in 2010, they believe that this will help people to alleviate their suffering at the end of life.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of eutanasia will not be a sign that the lives of older persons or persons with disabilities are less valuable.
With regard to persons assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care for the sick, the situation is less clear, the authors say.
They also suggest, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legally ordered termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also demands that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for refusal to take care of late life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, health institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal sedation already widely used in Canadian health-care institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to impede physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same limitations.
Comments of other experts
Some experts in health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts from the Royal Society of Canada.
Metre Pierre Deshan, a health law specialist, described the “cross” position of experts who signed the report because, among other things, it does not limit the use of eutanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age may ask for suicide assistance, says a meter of Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metre Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to place the independence of the individual above all other values that constituted social tissues.
He said, "There are warning signs and bans in society."
The health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “category dissent with the findings of the report, which she referred to as “the euthanasymanifest”.
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls upon President Asada to resign
Damascus condemns "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar Asada's supporters conducted a demonstration yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria, Bashar Asad, who, with the support of Russia, opposes him and condemns “conspiracy” against his country, increased.
Two days after the suspension of Syria's membership in the League of Arab States, the European Union tightened the sanctions against Damascus and the Syrian neighbours of Turkey and Jordan resigned President Asad.
King Abdallah II of Jordan became the first Arab leader yesterday, who called on President Bashar Asad to surrender power in Syria, where some 40 more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces were killed.
“If Bashar had been expensive for his country, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life, said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syria, in an interview by BBC.
In turn, Ahmet Davutoglu, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, regretted that Turkey ' s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
In the Middle East, those who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, pointing to Syria, the neighbouring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly rigid course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “enlargement of consensus against Asada and the actions of the Syrian regime”, following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey are taking an increasingly rigid course towards repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime were killed in the Der`a area in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Two other residents died during the shooting and and shelling of heavy machine guns in Jobara in the descended city of Homs, according to ONG.
During the press conference, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid Mualle, stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis.”
In addition, he responded sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to delete Damascus, which he said was “a dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, and he adds, assuming that this conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to delete the League of Arab States from Syria, it is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands that 500 members of the Arab organization for human rights, journalists and military observers be placed in the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alain Juppe, also, expressed his desire to send observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia”.
The new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to end the crisis adopted on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the fighting cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, described the “non-correct” decision of the League of Arab States yesterday, while China called upon Syria to implement the plan to end the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty takes time from markets and victims of Italians
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a programme that would require “sacrifices” to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner participated yesterday in discussions with political parties prior to today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet made up of technocrates not in Parliament.
Monty spoke of the importance of a large-scale victim programme, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups that participated in the discussions following a meeting with a candidate for the Prime Minister.
Speaker of the House of Deputies, Jonfranko Fini, said that he would wait to see if Mario Monty's Parliament would be asked to vote on trust by Friday to make sure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will conclude with Mr. Monty ' s submission of a limited list of dozens or about those ministers of the head of the country, George Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nerveness of stock exchanges and bond holders yesterday, asking them for time.
“Democracy requires time for the preparation of the Government and the programmes, he added that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.”
His appointment as President was initially approved by the markets, but his concern was again raised, particularly after the unexpected fall in the industrial production in Evrozon in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team that included, most importantly, the technocrates, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new Government will have to act until 2013, the date of the next elections, he said.
According to Speaker of the House of Deputies, Jonfranko Fini, the new Government will receive an octopus of confidence from Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to guarantee that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner, Ollie Ren, stressed that “without regard to the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed”.
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the 2013 budget, despite the strict savings plan adopted in recent months, required, inter alia, new strict measures.
The Italian boss of the boss, Emma Marchegalia, who would meet him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because the country that has no growth cannot meet the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the household by the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented “a change of age” for Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing the “severance of seriousness” and “other Italy”, according to the authors of predecessors.
The longevity of his team is the great unknown.
President Napolitano would be pleased to avoid the early elections, since by April 2012, Italy should pay $200,000 million on public debt.
Russian scientist assisted Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko assisted Iran with the development of a nuclear-weapon-friendly detonator, confirming on Monday the American atomic risk agency.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the UN Agency to identify the scientist.
Over the past week, IAEA expressed concern about the “potential military aspect” of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, which was largely based on IAEA documents, Mr. Danielenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “beginning in the sixtieth years, at the Soviet Military Nuclear Centre in Chellabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991, he left the centre to create a company producing nanoalmaza in Kiev.
His financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, IAEA referred to “the apparent signs that Iran's development” of a nuclear detonator system was “possibly contributing to the work of a foreign expert who, not only knew the technology well but also informed the Agency that he had worked most of his careers in the military nuclear programme of his home country”.
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes has increased by almost 50 per cent, while other forms of racial and religious violence have slightly decreased or not changed during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, representing 49 per cent growth, compared with a 13 per cent increase in Catholic violence, a reduction of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3 per cent were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
Following a decline in 2009, it is a matter of concern that the number of these crimes is re-evolving, stresses the human rights organization First, “Increasing violence against Muslims is particularly significant”, adds the organization to the official communication.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be regarded as serious human rights violations,” added one of the leaders of the organization Paul Leghand.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes”.
“Hate hate crimes” in the federal law are the legacy of the period of the struggle for civil rights.
This law was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and today by sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes like Facebook.
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those who are watching what makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "activity" and other "name" tab allows you to monitor more easily and directly the activities of other Twitter users, the Internet users whose messages ("watch") you monitor, and those who monitor yours.
This enables them to know if they publish messages if they sign up to new accounts if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "with a small percentage of users in August" before a wide-ranging network entry on Monday, AFP announced a Twitter press secret to Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively rather imprecise and used quite ambiguous terms (RTs for a change in someone else's compatibility, #followfriday for a recommendation to track other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, opens itself to a wider audience, presenting users something closer to the popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
On the Internet, users discussed this innovation using Twitters on the Internet.
"It's useless, inclined and too much to look like Facebook."
Functional activity will help me better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote @dannykronstrum.
Austria
Submission of a budget to the Constitution of the “Golden Rule”
The leadership of a large coalition of social democracies and Christian democracies in Austria decided on Tuesday to record the budget “solvent rule” of the Constitution in order to reduce the budgetary deficit and thus avoid a possible reduction by the rating agencies of Austria ' s public credit rating (three A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrat Werner Faymann has personally announced this decision at the end of the meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austria ' s public debt of 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the top threshold of the 60 per cent rule established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria ' s capacity to pay fell on only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay per cent more than 3,000 million euros a year, bring the argument of the Vice-Cancler and the Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Christian democrats Mikhael Schpindeleger.
Austria thus complied with the demand of the Euroson summit on 26 October in Brussels; heads of State and Government demanded a reduction in budgetary deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through the Constitution or equivalent law.
The decision adopted by the Austrian Government resembles the “German model”, since Germany was the first European country to accept this “rule”.
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and, since 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget of the federal State should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP in any year, and land, like the communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The objective is to make the State duty fall below the 60 per cent mark of the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Eshichiko Noda
threatens new interventions in the currency market
The Prime Minister of Japan, Esikhico Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new exchange-market interventions if the value continued to grow.
We will intervene, as we have done last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of yen, Mr. Noda Senate explained.
On Tuesday, the yen grew almost to a historic mark that had prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had established a new record of force since 1945.
But since then, yen has grown constantly, driven by investors' purchases, who see it as a “federation” in these turbulent times of the falling economy around the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic plan of 105 yen, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
On the eve of the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar had been worth about 120 yen and the euros more than 160 yen.
The growth of Japanese currencies is detrimental to Japanese exports, as Japanese products are more expensive and lower Japanese firms ' income from abroad in converting to national currency.
“Japan fights to rebuild itself” after the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March, which devastated the Tohoku region (North-east), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that the increase would kill the fragile guinea of recovery.
The third largest economic power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter of -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, due to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of yen does not reflect Japan's “fundamental economic performance”.
Dün Adzumi, Minister of Finance, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Coinary Policy Council, to take all necessary steps to weaken the ion.
But the Deputy Manager of Hirohide Jamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” to realize that no further mitigation on the environment should be expected.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the emitting organization increased by 5,000 million yen (Euro47,000 million) the purchase of treasury bonds, raising up to 55,000,000 million yen (Euro 5,19,000 million) the ceilings it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments to feed the market of securities.
Eurason
Growth rate, stock exchange fluctuations
The risk of contamination by the debt crisis undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in volatile countries continue to rise
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left this Tuesday, 15 November, a little further to the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and finished travaux 3.064.
DAX in Frankfurt fell 0.4%, and London fell 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties in paying loans to countries in difficult situations, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"Worried investors are just overly concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker of IG Markets quoted by Reuter.
The Tokyo Exchange has been closed with a fall of 0.7 per cent under the cargo of newly doubted market participants for Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has stabilized its view of Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in the corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized”, states Mitsusige Akino, the fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
It is a return of concern about the future Eurozone that hits one currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
Euro reached its bottom mark in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., European currencies cost $1.3570, falling by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the consignment of the Chancellor, Angela Mercel HDS, on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, inter alia, the possibility of leaving the European Union without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates substantially above 6 per cent
Loan rates in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning, Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85 per cent on Tuesday, and Spanish bond earnings reached 6.2 per cent on the same date.
These difficulties with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Government of Italy, Mario Monty, asked the time exchange to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadimos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be his Government ' s “core task”.
Spain was shelled by markets before parliamentary elections on Sunday.
A new historical maximum has been reached between the interest rates for the 10-year debt obligations of Germany and Spain.
Expected Growth in Eurason
France recorded economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3 per cent because of increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised to reduce the number of the second quarter, with a fall of 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And the economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent during the same period.
The first assessment for the eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic on which no decision can be taken after a brief discussion or emotion is not made, it is energy policy.
Accessibility and the cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings are a reason for reflecting on the proportion and place of nuclear energy.
The dispute would not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options were explored.
France should base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will double the need for electricity by 2050 unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing deficit of fossil resources in order to continue the production of electricity continuously, keeping in mind the crucial need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat the climate imbalance, the topic that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukusima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most up-to-date reactors.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are only a few who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukusima to add one installation to its kit, renewing the construction of a station that had been interrupted after the Tri-Mayle Island accident.
While Germany ' s model based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, the reality is contrary to that argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the value of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the leakage of carbon dioxide emissions from the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these adverse effects will be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The European turbin construction champion, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is also the largest coal and gas consumer because of the pre-burst wind; the carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices are 65 per cent and 50 per cent higher, respectively, than the average in Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and in the maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the lowest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will increase the value of electricity, which will make it illusory to declare the new industrialization of our country and to protect the purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay is more because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy made it possible to establish an industry of 15,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirectly.
It is highly export-oriented, attracts a whole tribute of specialized specialized in international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France had decided to renounce nuclear energy, it would have to contribute large numbers of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrical engineer will order the EPR to work for 60 years if it is scheduled to close the manufacturer?
In order to solve the equation of energy, it must be recognized that there are no divine or devilic sources of energy production.
The development by the Areva of low carbon dioxide, nuclear and renewable solutions shows the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flemish.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
For 50 years the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mile Island, under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukusima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented force that caused the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from the accident, as learned from the two previous ones.
The fruit of this step and cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to combat such phenomena.
As it is being considered by all energy experts wishing to build a reactor, the stopping of its construction in Flemish will be a great gift to the Competitors Areva and EDF, clearing their way to win leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion, dogmas and biased manoeuvres to prevail in a dispute that is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration Is a Burden or a Benefit to the Economy?
Immigration policies in Nicolas Sarkozi have been criticized on various sides: overloading of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate to the number policy and compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as “the State of human rights”.
Then there was an administrative oppression of foreign students, which came in the news when the Minister of the Interior, Liberassion of 23 May, stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stoners and waiters”.
But it is rarely analyzed economically.
The right and left parties in this regard agree largely.
On the right hand, Jacques Shirac, who stated in 1976 that “900,000 unemployed persons would not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers” and, on the left hand, Michel Rockar, who explained in 1990 that France could not “receive the poor from all over the world”.
Difference in generosity only
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country was felt by both the left and the right of the Polish water supply.
Both sides see the burden on the French economy and the French society in immigration.
The difference is only in the level of generosity that they will offer to immigrants.
In his programme, François Olland confined himself to banalities, saying that “the joint work will solve our problem of immigration”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but it is costly economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book that summarizes recent data on immigration (Personal people: How migration has shaped our world and will determine our future, May 2011, Princeton University, 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that adopt immigrants.
Restriction on immigration has reduced growth and reduced employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the perception that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, provoking lower wages.
Experience has shown, however, that in reality immigrants are far more complementary than the local labour force is replaced by work that lacks local labour.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not related to job offers.
Positive effects on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesiologists and the complement between local and immigrants, it would have a positive effect on the local wages of immigrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of per cent of migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6 to 0.9 per cent of real long-term wages.
This, without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (in the middle of the American Nobel laureates, a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, while Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo, all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make net gains in social security systems, giving an average of 1 per cent of European total budgets.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that immigrants who have arrived at 30 years of age in Germany will, for their lifetime, bring net profits (negative income) to the State budget of an average Euro150,000.
Nicola Sarkozy, at the beginning of his mandate, was going to be “sounds” to enter the missing points of growth.
The teeth mentioned used to intimidate immigrants had a similar effect.
Europe has invented democracy and remains to reflect on European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but fragile.
The European continent must remember that, by inventing it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it survived the tragedy of World War I, the totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulga and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonel in Greece.
Some felt that democracy was sufficient to achieve its enemies and make it as direct as possible.
Since Napoleon 'Malogo', it's known that it's from the surface of the mind.
General vote, although binding on democracy, is not a sufficient prerequisite and can even be a “dispression tool”, as Etienne Vurro, a philosopher.
No, democracy requires much more — public space, public spirit, values, organizations, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is the economic crisis, but first and foremost the political crisis and the crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinodia of the True-Live Greek referendum will have a double declaring effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the uncomfortable sense of its inability and inconsistency.
This double nature needs to be considered to be overcome.
The truth is that the front line for democracy has now shifted and, in the view of many, Republican soldiers are now targeting the wrong side.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums organized as necessary and chaoticly.
"Cart Blanche" for an absolute European monarch or leaps with bound legs in the gap of nationalism, what a choice for a citizen!
No, we wish not for the guillotin's leverage, but for a joint, clear and continuous choice and democracy this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and we do not know how many more of them will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis in Europe.
Europe is fully subordinated to the dictate of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
Europe is entirely humiliated on the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to restore the administration of the European project to people's sovereignty.
Because only joint Europeans can reduce the debt burden of everyone, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
Removal from the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without causing us a disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by socialists and Jacques Delira, all now demands the European economic Government.
Let's do it.
But imagining it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place is another insaneness and a new impasse.
We must begin a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to create a republican.
The revolution of interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build Europe, an economically unified one.
This can be done only through the establishment of a more democratic Europe at the political level, the present people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create the Europeans.
The incontact chips are spreading more and more.
The world chip exhibition is opened on Tuesday in Wilpente, Paris, in an optimistic atmosphere.
Indeed, 2011 will end with 11 per cent of world sales of micro-processors (bank cards, SIM-Cart phones) exceeding Eurosmart estimated at 6,000 million.
The most important non-contact technology sector is that allows public transport or purchases to be paid by simply holding a map over the reader.
This year the world will sell 460 million uncontact chips against 320 million earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (positive of 580 million units) to almost 10 per cent of the world chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which has long left the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of uncontact payments.
Approximately 26 million bank cards of Visa have already been provided with this function and are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France starts with a modest view, with 400,000 non-contact Visa maps.
But big shops are increasing pace.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontact Pass MasterCard.
To move faster, banks need to provide equipment to their clients.
“Two large organizations in France promised to systematically distribute bank maps for uncontact use to their clients in the future,” Gérard Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe, reported.
The banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in developing a future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
In the meantime, few machines are equipped with NFC technology (Communication of the passing field) necessary for such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they must actually fly next year."
"We are counting on world sales between 80 and 120 million in 2012," explains Mark Bertin, chapter Eurosmart.
But the banks go forward.
Yesterday Crédit Agricole announced an experiment in Kan from December to June next year.
Approximately 200 iPhone clients and staff will be provided with cechlams providing uncontact payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also stated yesterday that he was preparing to launch a proposal to allow his clients to pay on mobile phones.
Terrorist Front extends from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the connections of the Islamic Maghreb with the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians were now confident.
“The aid used by the two organizations and the reports of the secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have come to a similar conclusion.
The kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January revealed two linkages.
The kidnapped in the Niamey restaurant, close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leopur and Vensan Derrey, apparently were killed the following day along with several kidnappers during a French special unit operation.
Among the raids left after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several Sim-Simarts belonging to terrorists.
Here's terror.
An analysis of the calls that took place pointed to several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lived long in Maidiguri, northern Nigeria, Boko Haram Collibely and the other, allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but it is undoubtedly necessary to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for many years that the sect receives financial and real support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active," says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident in the actions and statements of Boko Haram and in its methods, which now include the use of death rows and increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community, headed by Washington, now puts pressure on Abuja to draw attention to the problems that Boko Haram poses.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded the group as a community of educated people that is not of interest.
Fast success
Based in 2002 in Maydiguri, with mosque, school and imama-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram, what west education means is sin, preaches the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in Muslim northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has made rapid progress.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the wicked central Government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed special activity by committing numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
The sect now radicalizes and goes beyond its northern entrances.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for an action that killed 80 people in José and then another in Abuja.
In June, in Abuja, Boko Haram organized the first suicide attack on the strengthened police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa, from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now concerned by all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi is strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with Presidents Goodlack Jonathan Alain Joppe warned of the danger of Boco Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
The world, as the Republican candidates see it.
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, the Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and incompetence.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, pursue a complex world with simple and more simplified ideas?
If you heard the candidates for the Presidents from the Republicans, the voters could believe that.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have multiplied the loud but deprived of details of foreign policy declarations, which are traditionally a strong party to the Republicans.
The loopholes relating to China, Iran and Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened Chinese to complain to WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive subject for America, frustrated by the migration of whole industries to Asia.
Worse, if that leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama of China, and the only candidate who is determined in complex foreign policies, have been unable to overcome the emotion - stemming position.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama ' s position).
But Huntsman, who's kept at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
Reagan style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm chosen, I'll stop Iran, he has announced."
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel by accusing Obama of failing to fulfil the promises to that partner.
Herman Kane, the second candidate rating, demonstrated a defamatory misunderstanding.
He had recently called for the resistance of the Chinese military threat because Beijing was trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China had already possessed it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks to strike Iran, said that he was prepared to use the United States army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture of suspects of terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Kane, Perry and Michel Bahman as a candidate.
It's all very far away from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McKain, the weight of foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower the tone of fighting terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, at the premature withdrawal of “blame” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which brought him the reputation of a weak policy.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population considers the positive balance of national security with Obama, which has eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that are tied in the sand.
And claiming that America needs to be restructured economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama of rights.
North Pollution, new Russian gas entrance gates to Europe.
Gas pipeline, which connects western Europe and Russia directly to the Baltic Seabed, is launched.
It is designed to provide a gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas manufacturer, wanted to celebrate this event with the poppy.
More than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic shores, between the orchestra and the bitches, the opening of the North Flow, the new gas pipe, which directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Mercel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fion, and his Dutch colleague Mart Rutete, together returned the symbolic ventile, which monitored the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
In the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic metres of gas will go to Western Europe each year on the first pipeline of 1,224 kilometres, connecting the Leningrad area to the land of Meklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic metres of gas equivalent to all French consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with severe resistance from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Flow will indeed allow the gas to be transported directly to Germany, avoiding passage through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose part of their power; they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not pause before comparing North Potock with the new “Germano-Sowette Pact”, pointing to an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
That means that the question is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, western Europe is seeking greater security for its supplies.
But at the price of Europe's deprivation of energy, because the project created sweep between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has been able to reach its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own reserves are already at their disposal.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, this is a new artery that binds us organically," asserted François Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are both politically and economically important.
All of this explains the broad smiles of the heads of Gazproma, who were present in large quantities in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
Construction of this gas pipeline is a technical advance.
The underwater pipeline is made of a steel trapped in the concrete to protect it from anchors of ships.
It's on the bottom of the seabed, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, the minefields remaining since World War II had to cross.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the Spokesman of the North Pot.
Many steps were also needed to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake of weight equal to 242 Eiffel Towers, without breaks throughout its length, without ventilations and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Swedish area, but the project managers abandoned it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian public company would live on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we're going to shut down the gas stream less than in a minute," says Jens Muller.
So in the case of leakage, the gas in the gas pipeline will go into the air.
But it seems unlikely to designers who designed sewage designed for a leak only once every 100,000 years.
The state of the gas pipeline will be monitored by a submarine that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by a circular system inside the gas pipeline.
The cigarette-like apparatus shall be entered within the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and shall be pushed forward by the gas flow.
Upon arrival after three full days of travel at 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any metal deformation.
The gas pipeline has been designed for 50 years without the need for the smallest repairs.
The gas shall be circulared only by pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure and 100 bars on arrival.
Five companies have combined their efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51 per cent of capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have established a joint venture called the North Potoc, which was commissioned to build and operate gas pipelines.
Its headquarters is located in Tsuga, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Subsequently, Gazprom leased the company for twenty years, with the possibility of extending the whole volume of gas transport.
“The Gasprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported”, asserts Jens Muller.
The financing of gas pipeline was provided by 30 per cent shareholders and 70 per cent by bank loans.
The total cost of work would be Euro7.4 million for two pipelines.
The investments of GDF Suez will be around 240 million.
But the minoritarian shareholders are sure they'll pay for their costs because Gazprom takes on all the risks.
Gas pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on the sandy shore planted by hiding trees.
Ventiles of 4.5 metres of height form an outgoing gas terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million per hour for full power and 6 million for 2012.
Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will return the taste to the writing.
He has the aroma of adventures, the hours spent after writing in the light of a candle.
Moleskine's notebook is easy to find out on the right black cover, on rubber, on yellow and white pages, as if it were yellow over time.
However, Moleskine’s notebook, the one we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, in Milan, decided to launch design notes.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's then consultant, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, a hammer - laminated cotton cloth used, for example, to cover benches.
This type of notebook is said to be highly valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine brought the old and forgotten thing that was a ritual for the Vanguard artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebragondi, who has since become a brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We have gone far away from the production of the first years when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting a default buyer's profile is difficult because the notebook is equally attracted by a businessman, a student and a person of a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-based and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 staff members, now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks to Fnac bookshops, shops in small towns centers, and has been able to become widely known.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need for a letter, despite the appearance of e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural feature is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; recently, a brand organized “Good Way” exhibition where architects and artists demonstrated their own notes.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard drawing on the occasion of a movie festival at Locarno.
Using his successes and cultural aura, Moleskine has made a variety of products that now include bags, pens, bags for computers. Brand includes all types of support.
The success that generated envy: Modo Modo was purchased in the autumn of 2006 by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, now Syntegra Capital, which put a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is unemployment so high among disabled workers?
Approximately 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of disabled persons begins today.
Despite public charity policies launched in 2005, the proportion of persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, 19 per cent as against 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
Disgusting?
"No," stresses Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities.
“In 15 years, significant progress has been made.”
"The share of the unemployed was not 2, but 3 times more."
"There's still a lot of work ahead."
It must be said that there are still many barriers to employment for the disabled.
Among them, there are more older persons: 37 per cent over 50 years of age (17 per cent on the average).
They are more likely to have low qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a bachelor degree, and of 2.3 million higher education students, only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, against the average of 38 per cent.
In short, these are all the criteria that make return to work very difficult and which constitute the essence of the problem”, according to Christian Grapen, Director-General of Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that is changing, but too slow.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrependre commissioned by Cité revealed that the managers interviewed had a low level of knowledge about disability and “represented persons in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally inexperienced persons”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from having 6 per cent of the disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The latest known figures for 2008 represent 2.6 per cent.
"Today we're about 3%," says Pierre Blan, Director General Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “contained” organizations, like the amounts paid, declined from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Act that raised the tax created strong pressure on companies, explains Pierre Blan."
“But this improvement also reflects increased consciousness, in particular in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of employees aged 20 to 49 have disabled workers, compared with 82 per cent of workers from 100 to 199.
Azar: "How happy"
Before fighting the Blue evening on Tuesday (2045) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We won't reach the point to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months later, the Belgian coach can only commend him after his attacker in the uterus against Turkey.
"I'm very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go on, I assure the Lille player.
As long as his achievements in the club are contrasted, it's one whole, he's justified.
"In Lille I'm a year round, and in Belgium I'm not."
"I have to make glasses."
Azar left behind, in front of this match with France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, came to St. Denny to finally blaspheme.
Not to forget, however, the notion of “satisfaction”.
He has supported the Blue since the age of 7 and the 1998 and 2000 winning campaigns.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also exacerbates the special nature of this match.
And especially that which is on the other side of Mother, Johan and Adil, he recalls.
"Just our roads crossed."
"The chance to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens remembered good-naturedly.
"Hordness" is playing a monster game.
"Hordity" also assert that France was "a very high-level team" just one year after the injury in Nigest.
"Loran Blan was like a thunderstorm, he admired.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, the technician athlete will fly in one plane with the direction of blue... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll make sure this is in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very self-confident
Portugal, Paulo Bento, begins its response match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to lose a sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paulo Benta sees himself in Poland and in Ukraine.
There is no doubt to him that the Assembly, with its steering power since September 2010, has been characterized by Euro 2012.
Portugal's only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a match to play, and Bosnia that must be won.
Taking into account 0-0 on Friday in hell Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal was dominant in the match more than an hour, it was unable to achieve the willful goal that would calm her down.
"It's a good result, but it's risky."
But in their luminously illuminated Stadium of La Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass in the eyes of the public, which should be delighted, even though the match will be very tense," said the optimistic but reasonable Benta.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50% chances of being on Euro 2012," said successor Carlos Kayros.
Night on Friday in the uterus against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
Nobody could have built Bosnians.
"It's a good outcome in which, however, some risk is, I regret Benta.
"We're going to play against a team with a lot of technical dignity and a lot of personal dignity," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on Bosnians from the outset, "not to give them time to think."
It's a good idea, only this time it's realistic.
