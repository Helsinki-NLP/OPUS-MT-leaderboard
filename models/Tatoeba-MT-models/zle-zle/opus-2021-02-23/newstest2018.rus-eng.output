President Vladimir Putin of Russia has signed a law establishing administrative responsibility for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of failure to fulfil its obligations by the employers in the conduct of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment on public and municipal contracts that had already been completed was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia commissioned the Attorney-General ' s Office to take special control over the issue.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfair contractors that had not been funded, they tried to evade the pledges made and included illegal conditions in treaties.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, the Public Prosecution Service has made 9.7,000 submissions in order to protect the entrepreneurs ' rights to pay for public orders, resulting in their disciplinary review of 4.5,000 officials, 533 administrative officials, and 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of the procedural inspections, 46 of which have been brought to justice.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles were paid to entrepreneurs.
These immense amounts have been accumulated far from the non-payment of multi-million-year contracts.
Best-word debts have resulted in numerous, systematic delays in paying services to entrepreneurs at a much modest rate.
Here's a characteristic case.
The leader of the small company won a contest for several million roubles of social transport services.
The man has invested all of his negotiable funds, fully honoured his obligations, but he has not received the amount of money.
The result is a growing financial comma of salary, taxes, credits that would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek assistance from the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been nullified as much as possible.
However, as at the first half of 2017, the total debt on public and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of entities in the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office operates under manual anti-crisis management.
The Attorney-General personally meets with local authorities to deal with all open-ended violations and measures to eliminate them immediately.
Such operational meetings were already held this year in Yaroslavla and Katherinburg.
It would be useful to improve the payment discipline of public employers to implement Federal Act No. 189-FZ on amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with regard to the establishment of administrative responsibility of the employer ' s officials for the violation of the time and procedure for the payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for the provision of public and municipal needs, which the President of Russia signed last week.
The draft law was drafted by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of Henprocurature.
The new Act supplements the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 roubles for the violation by the employer of the time and procedure for the payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
If an official has already been administratively punished for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of between one and two years.
All prosecutors of the entities of the Russian Federation have already been commissioned to enforce these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Unit issued a warning on the movement to Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colorful People published a warning for the Colorful Travellers in Missouri because of State discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The Panel's statement reads as follows: “Prevention to travellers of the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of Colorful People, effective until 28 August 2017, calls upon African American travellers, visitors and citizens of the State of Missouri to be particularly careful and to be more cautious when travelling through the State in connection with a number of doubtful racist incidents recently occurring throughout the State and brought here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colorful People, the group has issued a warning on the movement of the newly adopted Missouri law, which makes it more difficult for people to win claims of discrimination and that State law enforcement agencies are disproportionately selecting minority targets.
“You have people who are subjected to human rights violations.
They are stopped on roads because of colour, beaten and killed,” said Rod Chepel, President of the National Association for the Progress of the Colorful People of Missouri.
“We have heard complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first such warning announced by the organization to the state of the United States.
The Panel referred to such incidents as the humiliation of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished having petrol during a state trip, and the Missouri police arrested him without accusing him of a crime.
The warning also refers to the recent report of the Office of the Attorney-General of the State of Missouri that the risk of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for white drivers.
“The purpose of warning people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri”, said Chapel.
“People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they will take the money for the bail or report to the relatives that they travel through the State”.
According to recent data from the FBI hate crime programme, in 2015, a total of 100 hate crimes were recorded in Missouri, making the State sixteen in the number of such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new law of the State of Missouri, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal person in relation to housing or labour discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) had issued warnings to travellers on Texas and Arizona after these States had enacted new immigration control laws, which required local law enforcement authorities to arrest persons for violations of immigration laws, which, according to ASU, should have increased the number of racially based checks.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the Department of State for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people died as a result of shooting at a police patrol in Egypt
The unknown fired a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were injured.
All the wounded are taken to the hospital.
According to an agency, the police stopped the car, and two armed persons in the car opened fire on law enforcement personnel.
One of the wrongdoers was detained, the other succeeded in hiding.
Rosturism supports the Act to abolish free luggage for non-refoulement air tickets
The head of Rosturism, Oleg Safonov, stated in an interview to RBC telecommunications that “probably” refers to the enactment of a law to cancel free shipment of luggage on non-return air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person without a luggage can buy a cheaper ticket than the one who has a luggage,” he stressed.
However, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the concerns of citizens, it would not be necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothes and mobile phones in the handcuff.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and say that it's on top clothes, on umbrella, on mobile phones, on ice meals, or even on some computer that won't have a relationship," said Rosturism.
Previously, President Vladimir Putin of Russia signed a law prohibiting airlines from free luggage from a non-refoulement aircraft.
It is said that airlines can determine the number and weight of luggage included in the non-refoulement tariff themselves.
Vladimir Putin commissioned Baikal to eliminate pollution
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, at a meeting on the protection of Baikala, reported that in recent years large lake territories had been extremely contaminated.
It mandated to identify sources of funding, plans and performers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also commissioned the full recovery of the contaminated territories.
"We also need to understand the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning structures of most of them are worn out," quotes the President ' s RIA Newsty.
He also added that the Office of the Attorney-General of Russia should conduct a review of environmentally harmful activities.
He said that there were problems in the lake area with the emergence of natural landfills and a number of environmental irregularities by recreation organizers.
“I want to stress that not all should be checked, it also needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful, and to take appropriate measures,” he stressed.
Hencourtura had previously reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and had proposed an increase in the number of sites subject to environmental oversight.
Remember, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in the direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special security regime.
The Olhon Island, which is located in the Baikal Nature, was reported to him on the problems of economic activity.
The Head of Nature, Sergei Donsky, immediately proposed a solution by clarifying the Baikal water protection zone, but the Government of Buratia recalled that such a change was not sufficient, as restrictions were related to a number of regulations.
Previously, in the Ministry of Economy, it was proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A New Temple Will Be Found in Yugre
In the village of Sovova, members of the community of indigenous small indigenous peoples of the North “Rahtinja”, together with the inhabitants of the Berez district, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the sanctuary Nicolas Miracle Maker.
Its location is a river beach, the temple will be well seen from a distance, so it will serve as a beacon for fishers.
According to the community, construction work will be completed this year, domes are now installed and church bells are available.
The Igrim Fleet has provided transport escort.
The Temple is named after the Holy Nicholas Miracledore, as it is worshiped by the Orthodox Church as a patron for travelers, including fishermen.
On the other hand, in Thessalonica, fishing provides work and food to settlers.
Local residents look forward to opening their doors and even writing their children in school writing about it as a local note.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why do Singapore comply with laws?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in a diner in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, but the cigarettes are carefully folded into the iron box that has been taken from his office.
After the conversation ends, the businessman is headed to the nearest urn, to the nearest one foot [100 m], and throws oxen there.
The garbage fine in the public area is $500 locally, reports Chang.
You know, I've had a reflex since I was a child: you can't throw a phantics fiction on the bridge, you'll be fined momentarily.
And now it's all video cameras.
And indeed, the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, like in the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted the graffiti wall of the old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to chastisement.
What?
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the berries and spent a week in prison.
We don't have a lot of corporal punishment at all.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and the incredibly harsh laws, the AIF surveyor was on the ground.
No one here thinks to abolish the death penalty,' explains Victor Lee Hong.
And the Government has long been indifferent to both the European Union and the United States.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or sells them, he has a velvet.
In 2002, 22-year-old Australian national was detained at Changi airport, carrying 400 g cocaine with him.
The Australian Prime Minister spoke in his defence, threatening with sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was finally hanged up.
After that, the drug traffickers in our country are diligently moving around.
The point is that Singapore has established that laws are obliged to comply with ALL consecutively, not only with modest and poor people.
No matter who you are, a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist, or a European citizen.
The option is one: If you find a cocaine shelf, you'll be hanged.
When you walk across Singapore and you meet a lot of warning plates, you're just wondering how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing rubber is sold only in the pharmacies, and it can be purchased strictly by a doctor’s prescription.
The tourist will not take the gum off at his arrival, but he should stick the cut in the subway, get a fine of $1,000 locally.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on the neck, "I garbaged."
For the abandoned urea, the octopes, in addition to the fine, are often sentenced to a bay in the palaces, a week to clean parks and beaches.
6000 roubs pays a “custodian” who forgets to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a little difference in the living elevator, a special detector works, the doors are blocked and the police sends a signal.
Exotic laws include the prohibition of the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public execution of songs, and even the excessive water of the room plant (!): mosquitoes are considered to attract water.
To avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined by 5,000 Singapore bucks.
Well, the idea is, if you try, you'll have to break something.
It's not right, but it's trying to find me Mohammed Kabyriya, the owner of the local tourist.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last 20 years, I have not seen anyone attracted for their violation.
Why do they stay?
So that citizens don't relax.
The implementation of the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Let's say if a minor is sold in a cigarette cyoske, he'll be punished on the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the violator himself will be hit with the sticks on the back, and the seller will also be shot and put to prison.
It is because of such severe laws that offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
As early as seventy years, we had chaos on roads — motorists ignored the lights, traveled as they wanted, drank behind us.
After the fines were imposed, everything calmed down for a year.
The driver now knows that if he stops, the police will not let go for a bribe, the cost of the apartment will be fined, and they will be sent for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to have a concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore “Disneiland with the death penalty”, a visitor from the United States, terrified the wealth of the inhabitants, the “dangerously clean airport” and the “cultural nature”.
To detect, such things are indecent, artificial, and so shouldn't be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a paper on the pavement, you're seizing if you're in the subway with the ice cream.
But then you come to the Little India area, and suddenly, the "distort" of the pattern, and the bus stops have plastic glasses.
"What about that?" you're surprised.
And that's what, the Singaporeians smile.
Anything happens.
Not every "crime" will be seized on the ground, but you must know that if you are computed, you will not be retaliated. You have violated the law.
Most often, it's enough for a person to act normal.
Surely, Singapore has an authoritarian power.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Hushimina, I traveled very carefully -- motorcycleists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the middle of Paris, there are dirty bungs and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw garbage in urns, too.
Singapore, however, has become the world ' s most peaceful, clean and safe city through the imposition of dragon fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: Remember, and in Russia no one was stuck behind the wheel until the fines were fined.
While Singapore is not the most important penalties, it is voluntary law enforcement.
And we should think that we in Russia would also have people who would have had clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who confused the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment, thanks, don't.
On the other hand, Singapore's laws are at least worth examining them.
Nothing holy?
The White House of the Tramp now aims at Article Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he starts fighting statues.
The Americans understand it as much as all the others -- from here deliberately the theatrical demolition of the Saddam Hussein Statue on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Government of Trump, was undoubtedly aware of what he did when he took a symbolic axe over the Statue of Freedom during a violent dispute with journalist CNN Jim Acost on Presidential proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Be honest, Miller didn't bite the statue.
The owners of the walk and the artisans representing the Article of Freedom would lick him if he tried to do so.
But he tempted her, especially in the sense she had been assigned in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus’s poems were added to the pedestal.
Like Miller burst on Akost, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Freedom Statue is... a symbol of American freedom that obscures the world.
The content you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom."
Miller correctly described the facts, but as he said, it's not really a story.
This is about the present sound of the impressive words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your dead, your poor, your crowds, dreaming of breathing freely,"
It's never been that we've seen "unlucky dumps" on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature -- he made it clear that in America the Tempa of these people weren't waiting.
This dispute about the meaning of statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus, and her friends, who struggled to put her words on a statue after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a completely political act.
The sculpture on the purpose was to indicate the link between the French and American republics through a banal classical figure - the women ' s image of freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning — in her poem a woman’s figure is no longer abstract; she has a voice.
And she got a very different name, Mother of the Ignorant.
The connection of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a destructive attack against American oppression.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right, although changing it back.
The Ground Rash Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who announced the Trump coming in 2010, reasoned that Freedom was not inviting anyone, rather she was an early neoconconservator carrying the flame of America to the dark of the world: “Freedom is moving forward.
It bears a tomb of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
It doesn't need to light the way to the U.S.."
Limbo's really been at the point here against us.
The purpose of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her in the way she would be seen by the wretched, unhappy but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This means literally to look at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Its statue responds to the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And of course, that's not the prospect Miller and Trump will ever want to admit.
Their torch needs not to cover the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake commends Scottish members of the British assembly.
Alied Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottish men in the collection of Britain.
Neil Blake, director of the British Federation of Light Athletics, stated that a 16-person Scottish part of the World Campaign would make a “significant contribution to the team game.”
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship beginning on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland, “something special” and the British Federation of Light Athletics should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support as long as they have the potential," said Blake.
"I talked to people at Scotland Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Easy Athletics thinks they have to work with what they've done.
The British Federation of Easy Athletics: with what they did, we have to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things have happened, but it's perfectly brilliant."
Some of the Scottish Scottish leopards claim for medals, including Laura Mür and Andrew Buchert, who would rival Sir Mo Farah for a distance of 5,000 metres; and Alied Doyle chose her captain.
"Alide is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," says Blake.
"Scottish people, whether they're Scotland or not, and where they live or train, have come out of this room with pride and resolve to win.
The passion and sincere sentiments that Ailid put into her were wonderful."
The owner of the Commonwealth ' s silver medal championship, who, at her fifth world championship, will run 400 metres with obstacles, says that 16 Scottish people in the British assembly are “unlikely”.
The previous record of the Scottish world championship was seven in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Mure, a middle-distance specialist, was hit by five British and two European record last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500-m run, is another Scottish man who is worth noting: he has a successful season behind his back in which he has won the selection competitions of the British assembly and the annual competitions.
Doyle recalls her first championship of the world when she was the only Scottishman on the team.
The captain of the team says she's "unlikely proud" by the fact that so many of her fellows have not only entered the assembly but in some cases will be claiming medals and fighting to get out of the finals.
"The Captain of the assembly chooses other members of the team, so it was a great honour in any case, but to know that your companions voted for you and you were chosen, it was a very special thing for me," she added.
"Sure, I'm very proud of all the Scottish who entered the assembly.
This shows how much we have done.
And they are all the jolts that have taken place, and they will try to gain the honor of the pedestal.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was pretty good.
I'm just pointing out that we're very lucky to host the World Championship at our homes.
So it's just how important it's to get support from the hospitals and to take advantage of the fact that we'll be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere will be great."
Criticization locks on Facebook: you don't have to be public unless you're ready to listen to voter criticism.
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from internal politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, was annoying.
But he did not stumble his mouth to critics.
Because, back in 1783, Washington said, "We can take the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and the dumb, will lead as sheep to the slaughter."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Union of Civil Liberties put it to court for this.
The governor's subordinates called this claim negligible, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "no and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And that's especially important when it's about a guy like Hogan.
He's an amazingly popular governor in a democratic state.
He is second in his approval rating for 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactor.
He demonstrated a strong hand in State management and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook as the primary way to communicate with his voters and shows his head on his page after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking the people who come to the Governor's page - which is stated as an official public forum and is conducted by staff members of the administration for taxpayers is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview of the Washington Post, Spokesman Amelia Ches defended the Governor's actions, claiming that blocking the commentaries is just their modernization.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spears and heyers on the Internet.
The Post talked to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And they're real people, not trollly, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who's looking to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, informative and not rough.
The pastor quoted the Bible by appealing to the fact that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lackshmi Sarma Ramann, from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by the lack of his response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the commentary section on the post article.
"Now I don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it's a so-called curvature instead of recognizing that they're dealing with a large group of unhappy citizens."
What subordinate governors call "concentrated spam-attack," others would probably call "active life position."
In the age of Facebook, it is easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than before, when it required people to send, collect and burn newspapers with critical forwards or arrest and stumble the protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in the digit.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for refusing to listen to Facebook and other social media.
The President of Trumpu was tried by Twitter users who were banned in his Twitter window.
One of the first turning decisions on this subject was taken this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris of Alexandria, Laudon County Oversight Board Chairman violated the First Amendment by banning the voter in his Facecbook account.
In Kentucky, the republican governor Matt Bevin filed claims by the American Union for Civil Liberties for his behaviour in Facebook and Twitter.
It must not be so hard.
In Washington, D.C., the age of available mail costs was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four times, and the anonymous letters had severely undermined his authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the names of Yuricola, Valerius, Belizerius and Portius wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to the historical documents compiled by George Washington's "Documents" online project, his office was filled with petitions criticizing his position on the Friendship, Trade and Seafaring Treaty.
But he wasn't trying to make them shut up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lie at the very foundation of our State.
And true leadership means concurring with that.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for the comforts of the Renaissance Club
The former European champion, Ronan Rafferti, looks forward to the comfort of the household for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Lotian will receive the twenty-fifth open Scotland golf tournament for older athletes.
A North Irelandian who led the Nordic Lieutenant at the Archerfield Links Club and moved towards the final round last year until Paul Ils lost his new place and acted as a representative of the tournament on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
“I saw how the Renaissance club was being built, and we see it come to success with the event,” said Rafferti.
"The gamers will see this field at his best moment, it's in great state.
Jerry did a great job to set up this place.
He's a strong adherent to this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is an excellent demonstration for this field.”
Englandin Ils looks forward to holding the Championship for the first time, even though his 32-year career has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge.
"It's really a special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't try again "Extremadura Open" because he was removed from the schedule a year after I won.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a beautiful golf place.
The memories of the past year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sheron, it was a very special impression of winning last year.
It was indeed a special time, and we will always remember it.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European tournament for older athletes, is returned to the battle on his homeland once he was 50 years old this year.
The event will be its first appearance in Scotland from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said Helensboror's resident.
"You want to speak well, but you feel this extra burden."
I enjoyed playing again, and I showed a nice golf.
I am pleased with the way things are being done."
In this field, the former winner of the Masters tournament, Ian Wusnham, and the medjor champions for older athletes Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalti, will join the Trio.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two out of six Scottish on the field; the others are Andrew Aldcorn, Stephen Macalister, Bill Longmüir and Ross Drammond.
Participation in a tournament is free, and parking costs £5 per hour if one person is in the car, and £10 if two or more.
All income goes to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Carbon-carbon oxide tunnels are already undergoing testing on British roads.
The country ' s transport agency reportedly reported the positive results of the 100-metre tests of a 100-metre tunnel on a highway in the north of the country.
A tunnel of 6 metres is constructed of some of the latest polymeric materials that can absorb the harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the extensive measures the British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the electrical electric power stations, implement a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand the use of commercial electrical traction transport and modernize the heavy truck park.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollutants are transported, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgordud has changed the punishment to the disabled Mamayev for a fine.
The Mosgorous Judgment changed the sentence of a handicapped Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment, to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
This is reported by the TASS.
Previously, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional sentence, explaining its request that Mamajeva ' s disease prevents his finding in prison conditions.
Anton Mamayev, aged 28, was sentenced to four and a half years ' imprisonment while serving sentences in a general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former fighter.
On 19 July, the court released a man from custody at a visiting meeting in SISO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Preparing lunch, Bardin Degey doesn't use a stove.
She's not even using a pot.
In its wooden house in Enarotala, the capital of the area of Paniaya, in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewives usually simply puts sweet potatoes, which here is called “nota”, right into the window.
In half an hour, the stolen tuber is taken and eaten with impatient, unwitting hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor — she doesn't have furniture — and it's here she's doing her homework, such as washing her clothes with mud water from a nearby swamp.
The bathroom serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She's the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she wasn't assigned to work in the field.
Multiplicity is widespread here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"No one decides to walk the village after five evenings," she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at day-to-day life in the highlands of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which was joined by Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly lifting their hands before the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands has quickly turned its anger against the Government of Jakarta, which maintains severe control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Anarotali is as remote as the abandoned city; the road here includes a 1,5 - hour flight from Jayapura, the provincial administrative center, Nabira, and a five - hour trek on a hired car.
No public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses wrapped in bamboo fences; the roofs of the garbage have been painted with rusty rusts in a variety of red spots.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost none of them.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the pagoese mego worshipped the god Uga Tamaei.
Other changes were also made.
"We were not used to wear this clothing," says Degei, showing on his bright, sunny hand turban, dark jeopardy and a bright shirt.
"At the beginning, only leaves were we wearing on the body."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, and levels of child mortality and literacy among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
The world's largest gold mine and its most profitable mine, Grasberg, located in Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high-level province of about 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
In 2015 alone, freeport earned about $3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be praised by forest stockpiles, estimated at $78 billion.
These wealth, however, brings one calamity to the papouas, guaranteeing that Indonesia's powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to the New York Times in 2005, freeport paid almost $20 million to local soldiers and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy by the papias threaten the existence of this gold and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Human rights defenders claim that more than 500,000 papouas have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres of indigenous highlands of Papua in the seventieth years can be considered genocide.
Only last year had the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We'll lose everything”, a 2016 Brisbane eparchy report, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — especially the part claimed in another report, rape and electric shock — and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because the incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Guys have prolonged since Papua resources have attracted influxes from other parts of Indonesia.
A total of 83 per cent of the provincial population consists of Christians, but populations change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from densely settled Indonesian islands, Yawa, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Japanese benches, “varungi”, sell roasted chicken and mixtures of hado-gado vegetables, which are offered with peanut sauce.
Local residents are trying to endure competition.
“Migrants began selling chickens and vegetables cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet Yow, a 20-year-old woman in Panama, who moved to Jayapur, the Province Administration, because of her work.
“The indigenous people of Papua Mama (Guomen) have lost their market.”
President Joco Vidododo of Indonesia, known in the people as Jokovi, vowed to engage in inequalities and violations of rights in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter engaged in support of 27 out of 29 districts in Papua, including Panama.
In Papua, however, nothing has changed, and the local people feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokovi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice,” says Joe.
In fact, only two months after the October Inauguration of Jokowi Paniai had experienced the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and the singing of Christmas hymns at the fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of darkness.
The scared children told them they should include headlamps.
According to the local pastor, Jawedt Tebai, a soldier offended their tone and returned some time later with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk were chasing children and beating them with rifles.
Then a soldier shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone fired a nearby government electoral commission building, and the next day the situation got worse.
About thousands of Papouasian men, women and children gathered in the soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunters' bows, and fulfilled the waite, and the papouas mee pago, and ran in circles, and depicted a bird’s song.
Some protesters began to push stones into the police station and the military base.
When the situation erupted, the soldiers on internal radio contact were ordered, “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, so he sounded, as stated in the official document that the TIME correspondents saw, but which was not published in the local media.
Fiftieth - year - old Heremias Kaiama, head of the Koto district in Anarotala, felt the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to go from house to house.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist," he told the magazine "TIME", standing on the porch of his brilliant wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but he says the bullet came from the shereng of the soldiers gathered.
"There was a crowd, there were many shots," he adds.
The local resident of Alfius Jova had three times as his cousin, who had witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and looked over his body to make sure it was him,” gloomily told Johanez, who, as many Indonesians, used only one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotja Mende, Senior Police Inspector, told the reporters that his officers were merely “protecting” their base because it was attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said the representative of the Papua Commissioner Poujo Sulistio in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and much more wounded.
The news of the murders came to Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a fervent speech in Jayapur expressing condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical abuse of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be settled immediately so that it will never repeat itself again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security of Viranto said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But almost immediately there were denials.
“The majority of the violations have been committed long ago.
Some of them occurred at ninety or at the beginning of zero.
The point is, we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures to be followed," he said.
Viranto then refused to speak to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “All will be judged by judgment.”
Viranto, accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the death of over 1,000 people during the 1999 bloody vote for the independence of East Timor, said that 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the incident in Panama.
Families of victims from Panama met such statements with grim distrust.
“I have been questioned four times over the past three years, but there has been no change at all,” says Johanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I'm afraid I'm being arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot.”
His brother Jacobus also felt that the people of Panama were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried bodies, the military came to me,” he says.
The shooting hasn't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in nearby Panama district of Dajaya.
During a collision between villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to help take the unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were wounded, including children.
A man, 20-year-old Ravianus Dow, who was drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Anguished villagers protested the office building site of the company.
According to the police, the villagers were rocking officers who responded with warning shots.
However, local residents claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Special Forces) fired on the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation,” reported the 20-year-old Dominggu Budiya magazine, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded rushed.
"I hid at my house for two days."
The Dayi Parliament demanded that the officers involved be called upon to respond and that the mobile police team withdraw from the region.
Panama has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development is a source of discontent for mee, Moni, Dani and damal tribes scattered throughout the land covered by the greenlands of the Central Highlands of Papua.
Many acceded to the Movement for Free Papua (OPM), the rebel army, which asserts that it protects the rights of the papouas by hosting sporadic attacks and abductions on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the OPM are from Pania, including Tadius Jogi and Daniel Judas Cogoya.
As a response in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and groundlessly detained under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some have never returned.
Among the population of Papua Panama, it is considered a “heavy, forgotten place”.
Poverty exacerbates dissatisfaction.
The small portion of rice sold in Enarotala is too expensive for the local population.
Bread is unavailable to the same extent.
People here grow everything they feed -- mostly notes, and some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crops for the family and the rest are sold in the local market.
The 10 tuber note is only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous papouas and new migrants have increased, which have arrived in large quantities since the introduction of new airlines at the Nabira airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papouas rarely lacks money or skills to pursue their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's no work or money," says John Gobai, chairman of the tribal council of Panama.
Insolation holds Papua far from the rest of the world.
Furthermore, restrictions on international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate cohesion with the relevant organizations” despite the fact that they were given rare permits to conduct the video.
According to Felima Kina, Deputy Director for Asia, Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jokovi election campaign to lift the media ' s restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been met.
“Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebels of the eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: denial of visa and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention implies that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands — requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “mispheric and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Panama.
The same countries have in the past supported the OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arramant Nasir, rejected the statement by the group, informing journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia, a democratic system still exists and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to draw attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights of Kias Van Baar, visited Jayapur on 4 May, local residents violated silence by saying, “We want freedom”, as the source asserts, who also attended the meeting, but who wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, the new presidential elections will be held in 2019, but the popes say they will not vote again for Jokovi.
"Joqui is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are part of the shooting in Panama," said Gobai, chairman of the tribe's council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Panama, except for living in the shadow of the threat of the greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health are in poor condition.
Gobai says that the residents of Pania, like other papias, consider their voice for Jokovi, the debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shootings in Panama carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: the body of one victim was buried in the area directly in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is likely to never succeed, they will at least prevent those responsible from forgetting their crimes.
“We killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without lifting his head.
"What else should we do?"
The fire for the second time covers the diamond skycrabe Faquel
The fire covered one of the world’s highest residential skyscrubs in Dubai on Friday, causing hundreds of residents to rush out of the seventy-five-foot-store construction of 337 metres high.
It's a second fire that's been fired on a high building, coincidentally called Fakel in two years.
The building was evacuated, human victims were not reported, and there was no prompt news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from fire alarms and cries of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” said the Reuter, a skyscrube resident named George.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Office, fire teams extinguished the fire at about 4:00 local time (00:00 on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working to provide asylum to victims.
The event can bring security issues to the agenda of materials used in the extremities of elevated buildings around the world.
In the Fakel Administration ' s investigation after the fire there, in 2015, it was found that the most grieved were the outer panels used for the formation and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that it was the view that the system of isolation and crying panels of the Grenfell Tauer building in London could expedite the spread of the June fire, resulting in the death of some 80 people.
The growth of tourist flows in Ida Virumaa in June proved to be minimal
According to the data provided by the portal of rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the services of North-East hotel facilities had been used by a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, an increase of 125, or 0.6 per cent, than in the same period earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, the overseas turmoil increased by 7.3 per cent (544) in June to 794 tourists.
The number of local tourists fell by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region has increased by 8.9 per cent, or by 318 persons, most noticeably in the region, compared with June 2016.
Just in June 2017, 3885 guests from the RF stayed at the Ida Virumaa Hotels.
Andrey Malakhov gave insight to worshippers who were guilty of his departure
Andrey Malakhov installed his worshipers in Instagram who would blame him for his departure from the first channel.
To date, he has not commented on rumours, but today he has placed a section of the article “Vengeances” of August 1.
Malakh's photo was signed by a boss of milk.
Article on how to prevent and pay attention to the "growing" of the employee.
When you recall the many reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who started to re-format "The Speak Out", it becomes clear that he made a so transparent hint, writes "C".
Television leader Andrey Malakhov was reportedly on leave and did not sign a application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal may be clarified in the next days.
Five military personnel died in Afghanistan during the explosion of a car
At least five troops died in the explosion in the Afghan province of Guilmand, transmitting RIA Newsty.
According to the police, a mined car exploded on the previous night near the military blockpost in Ghiresk's area.
20 dead people are known.
On Friday morning, a new FP took place in Hireske.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The shooting between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Daver took a video of his camera shark.
Daver and researcher Greg Skomal (Greg Skomal) printed a video of a shark that bit his goPro cam.
Role was placed in Facebook by the United States Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Scomal.
The incident took place on 2 August off Cape Kod Coast in the north-east of the United States, clarifying the portal Necn.
The man tried to remove the shark on a camera held on a special stick during the underwater navigation.
After seeing a man, the animal was more than three feet [3 m] long.
Acula began to bite a camera without trying to attack a scientist.
The stomach explained that the predator had done the same to determine whether the hotel was eaten.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the instrument.
He also noted that the behavior of a marine animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight at the Ural Military Centre was known.
A working group of senior military officers in the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where a mass fight took place to investigate the incident.
Some details of this fear have already been known.
According to the Mash publique on VContact, Ural Military Contractors were brutally attacked because of an unmanned bed.
All started with the fact that a row named Saian demonstratedly ignored the officer's order to fill in a cracking sheet.
The soldiers from the sixth company stood on the side of the officer.
Saianna supported the first mouth.
In half an hour, 140 young men were killed in the barracks of beds and shells, and the glass was beaten.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
In the CIA, the information on the ceiling was denied.
The study showed that at least one fifth of U.S. passengers carried prohibited items into the aircraft.
The study found that more than 20 per cent of passengers were deliberately or accidentally carrying off their luggage on board through the United States Transport Security Administration inspection points prohibited items, including at least 6 per cent sitting on a plane with banned knives or other sharp objects in misconsideration.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later found that they had accidentally firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., covering over 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that deliberately attempted to fly with something that was prohibited by APC, 19.7 per cent were millennias, compared to less than 15 per cent of the members of the Generation X.
Wisely, ATP staff are most likely to carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that acute items had been specially carried out through inspection, while 2.2 per cent of respondents to women and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers all over the country to find out how many of them had accidentally smuggled through searches at airports, and how many had done so deliberately.
It is expected that most people, whether deliberately or deliberately, are smuggling through searches, those who fly most.
According to the company, the ATP rules are rather complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry and in what quantity.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what ATP takes is forbidden liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that APB could be considered forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are permitted on internal flights, but not on international.
Chapter EPA Prüitt refuses to defer implementation of Obama emission reduction regulations
The following day, following the 15 states' claim, the head of the Environment Agency rescinded its decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama to reduce emissions of air pollutants and the potential for education.
Prüitt explained that his agency was now more likely to listen to the needs of individual state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He did not mention a claim against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute was sporadic to the period of 1 October, to which the states should meet the Ozone Standards of 2015 on land level.
In June, Prüitt announced that it would postpone its implementation for one year to give its agency more time to study the plan and to avoid “inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
The Prüitt, who, before being appointed President Trump to his current position, was the Attorney-General of the State of Oklahoma, was long known as a consistent opponents of tightening environmental standards.
After the move to Washington, D.C., it has repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of rules against the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change in the course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Piwitt to return to previous standards.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the head of EPA had exceeded his authority to postpone the implementation of the Obama Administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Prüitt suggested that it was simply the duty of EPA to cooperate with States in the integrated implementation of new standards in a timely manner, once it had changed the course on ozone standards.
“At previous administrations, EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines, after which it was awaiting claims from activists and other individuals, and discussed the time frame for the settlement of the case,” said Prüitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous position.
“We do not believe in the regulation of trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the authority he gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that the Prüitt may at some point reuse its “receivement powers and other legal powers” to ensure that the rules of “jcyjdfys in a clear course and in all available information.”
Republicans in Congress insist on a wider revision of the ozone rules.
The bill approved by the House of Representatives last month seeks to postpone the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The Senate on this matter has not yet voted.
Attorney-General of New York, Erik Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of the States that filed a complaint against EPA this week, said that the group intended to continue with legal pressure.
"The change of the EPA course, after our claims, is an important victory in the fight for health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkese and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the ability to cover their cities," said Schneiderman.
California, Connecticut, Delaver, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombian County, joined the New York suit.
Ozone at the ground level arises when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, petroleum and chemicals and other sources enter the atmosphere with solar light.
This can cause serious problems with breathing in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected shift in the course of Prüitt.
"To think more deeply about how much pressure it took to achieve this perfectly logical step from the man who is responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Ann Burd of the Biodiversity Centre.
“We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump Administration and protect those polluting the air and their special interests.”
IAAF Congress extended the removal of the World Federation of Light Athletics
The International Association of Light Athletic Federations (IAAF) Congress voted in favour of extending the suspension of the World Federation of Light Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Reconstruction of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, which recommended that the suspension be retained.
For the extension of the suspension, 166 people, versus 21, passed the TASS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress towards the conditions established by the Council for Restoration of Membership, but that these conditions had not yet been fully implemented.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA in the London World Cup, Russian light athletes were forced to speak under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 persons admitted to the IAAF Primeity.
WFLA was disqualified indefinitely by IAAF in 2015.
The report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Dicka Pauld, was then published, describing the numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For further details on the last report of the IAAF Board, see the “IAF Extension of VFLA Sanctions” material.
Ordinary defeat
Within the 3th tour of the Fonbeth-Privacy of Russia, the PFL teams of the newo-skov Chimic played an exit match against the KK Kaluga.
Less than 10 days ago, rivals played each other in a Russian cup, but this time it was quite different.
The chemical did not yield to anything to the opponents, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive naked and fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the squirrels with the account 0:3, many had foretelled the slight victory of the hosts.
Since the beginning of the meeting, however, the newcomers have been compelled to be treated and acted against defence, but from a position of force.
In one time, the skirts were built more and had the advantage of owning the ball.
A second very qualitative match was Alexey Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected the dangerous blows and gave confidence to the partners by his actions.
Unfortunately, Chemicals had not had enough effort and luck to impose a stalemate on Kalugi's defense and to kill the first head on the exit.
After a break, the game began running in counter courses.
Newborns were more active in the attack.
The alarming calls for our team were defence errors that allowed the pussies to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemical took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the caluzans has played a role -- they had a more literate and cold-blood end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, Chemical moved the ball to the corner whereby the owners of the field, without resistance, were transferred to the gate.
Yury Dubrovin was the naked author.
In the reporting meeting, Chemical demonstrated a good game but suffered an offensive defeat.
Our team is waiting for another visit, on 11 August, at 19 a.m. in Moscow, at the Torpedo Stadium, named Eduard Strelzov, to fight with the favorite Centr Group of the FC “Ararat”, composed of Roman Pavlucheenko, Marat Ismailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come back to "Chimic!"
The location and time of the meeting of the newly-built islanders is 6.30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (East, d.2, corp.

According to published telephone decipheres, Trump pressed Mexico on the fee of the wall on the border
The Washington Post published telephone interviews between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a telephone conversation with President Enrique Piña Nieta Trémp, Mexico, he insisted that he cease to publicly claim that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The U.S. President was mockering him for his public speech against the wall, and according to the information he asked, “You can't say this to the press.”
The trump began its pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and swore that it would make Mexico pay for the project.
His first telephone conversation with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Australia, was also marked by a hot reassignment.
Trump said to Ternbull that an agreement under which the United States should accept refugees sending to Australia, “silent”, “refoulement” and “different” and insisted that it would look like an idiot because of an agreement concluded by the Obama Administration that it intended to cease the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
The trump concluded by saying to Ternbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation in the entire day.”
The bodies of those who died in Abkhazia were sent by a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A aircraft belonging to the Russian Airline on which the bodies of the deceased Russian women are on board in Abkhazia flew 20:15 by Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg.
At the end of the trailing point, the officers of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city mayor, told the journalists, the Deputy Minister for Kuorets and Tourism, Abkhazia Astamir Ahba.
Previously, the representatives of the MCS of the Republic stated that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia had taken over the Abkhazia Government.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to compensate the families of the deceased in the amount of 500,000 roubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazi leadership has expressed its willingness to pay to the relatives of the victims of the overflight and residence in the Republic, but the relatives have only sent to the Republic the right to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 in Moscow, two bombings in the village of Primarsk of the Gudout region in the rocket-artillery weapon of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic had been erupted, after which the large-scale missiles and other munitions had been detonated.
As a result, the warehouse fired, causing uncontrolled shell explosions of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens, Elena Polacova, were killed in 1970 and Elena Timothyb, born in 1962, who were at rest near a survivor ' s source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia citizens, were taken to medical facilities in the Republic with different degrees of seriousness.
At present, seven persons remain in the stationary, the rest of them.
Examination of the Russian impact on the American elections will take place in a large jury
The Russian Special Prosecutor Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., which will study the influence of Russia on the U.S. President’s elections in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to interrogate witnesses under oath.
The material collected will examine the Special Prosecutor and decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The call of a great jury gives Muller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the following investigations to the jury panel, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son at that time of the candidate for President Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalie Wesselnicka.
To verify the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, Muller himself had previously been promised.
They're already studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Junior had expanded his legal staff.
The Jr. Trump had previously told him that he had waited for a compromising position for the candidate's headquarters from the Dempartion of Hillary Clinton, but no expelling documents had been submitted, and the outcome was adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that the Trimpa Junior ' s statement of the meeting with Vegetnica was literally dictated by the Elder Trump.
In the White House, it was clarified that the president had not dictated anything but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Penza vice mayor detained in the workplace
The Deputy Head of Administration of Penza Irin Shirshin was detained for 48 hours on instructions from the Investigative Committee in its workplace, reports RIA Newsty.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on the matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the UK assured that they would soon be followed.
The Pensa mayor has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five Deputy Heads of the Penza Administration.
She had been in charge of urban affairs and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she had been a long-term head of the Directorate of State Building Technology Inspectorate of the Pennsylvania.
Irina Shirshina raises three minor children, notably that she again became a mother a year ago, abandoned her maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no space and no launchers in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the installation of Jury Gagarin's voucher is a tribute to the first person who went to space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period that have been demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin are, on the other hand, “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, a monument was installed in the American Houston near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument was established in the Royal Observatory in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There's a monument to Gagarina in Germany in Erfut, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Carlo Varah, Czech Republic, escaped from the public protests in 1992 and was transferred from the city centre to the site in front of the local airport.
During the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga, a monument was created by Yurius Gagarins.
That's the name and name of the first cosmonaut in Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Mors Ford murder: activists lose Linch courts on the stage to call for justice
The Fard Mercury travelled past the village of Monroe in Georgia in 1948 and roared to the little bridge of Mors Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver came to the bridge, a group of white men with guns prevented her from going.
The man of middle age in his suit in a delicate strip, pulled his cigar and looked through the windscreen.
The people in the middle were trembling with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" rumbled the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The provocative outbursts ripped the silence when a young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene, which was played on July 22, is just an instinct.
But when Roger's neck was thrown into the loop, almost all the spectacles and really kept breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Mors Ford Bridge to re-emerge the night that, in 1946, the dollwixclans lingered two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malk and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted for these murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years no person has been arrested - although we see them close to us; even though we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped to organize a plot.
"It's a spot in our history and it's a rock on our souls."
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of the Georgian Congress, who struggles for human rights all his life.
For him, the spectacle is a dramatic appeal for action and an annual reminder to Monroe people that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to finish, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The coroner covers the body of one of the survivors of the leaning at Mors Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to the FBI material received by Enbi Ci News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring counties were suspected of being involved in linching.
But no one was charged.
Although suspects have remained at liberty for decades, human rights defenders say that the city has always been well aware of the two related motivations of leaners: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court rule granted for the first time to black citizens a praimeriz to be held that summer.
Approximately during the same elections, according to the FBI, the black user Roger Malcolm hit Barnett Hester's knife in the fight, the white landowner is visible because of the woman.
Brooks says that by hearings in the city, Hester slept with his wife, Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she was supposed to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in a mortgage to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and drove to the bridge of Mors Ford, a crowd of ringers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded assassinations," the conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between State law enforcement agencies and the city that not only participated in the killings but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks called this shorter.
"It was an attempt to vote," he says.
"They all were killed to send a sign to the blacks in the city, and if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has led an annual play on the Mors Ford bridge.
Its spectacle is visible, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that many would like to see is no longer in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks it's the most important thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linch courts because they show us our own freakyness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
The rehearsals of this year began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actresses, a dozen whites, the other blacks, gathered in the room and listened to the plays that had been slipped over the years.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He had played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but he said that the role had never been lightened.
"I feel like I'm out of sleep because it's not the person I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at that time."
At the premises of the actors, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, they repeat their roles.
The spectrum begins with the Malcolm, erupted by Hester's sleeping with his wife Dorothy screaming and pushing him.
"I said nigga, get out of my house!"
Knocking Descona back.
There's a blow coming.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are grudging.
Green laughs louder than anyone else.
"What is it?" Ascona asks.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
Am I playing again?
"No," says Green through laughter.
"I just don't think the white people said 'nogga'."
"Yes, yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to say firm 'r'."
And the same is true of energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of association.
All must do the right thing, not only for play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Descona speaks the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No man laughs.
The spectrum ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
The woman in the mourning black clothing stands over the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by word.
Half a hundred yards of the audience wipe tears and sweat out of her eyes.
The number of blacks and whites is almost equal among the audience.
One couple came from Tokyo, New York, to see the picture; many live close to them.
They all endured the hard spirit of Georgia for almost eight hours while Brooks was driving them to the tombs of Malcolmov and Dorsey.
Until that point, the killings were only a story, but now that they were standing at the same place where people were grinding, it seems that their ghosts are flying right away in the air.
When the last note of the song gets quiet, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children groan to their heads, touch the paint that depicts blood and the immobile bodies and whisper to each other.
"They aren't really dead," a little boy mutters like to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe tears out.
Bradshaw is hugging Marbo, a man in a suit that played the main dollwixclan.
Nick Descona hugs two other actors, and suddenly, weeping, falls into their arms, and the emotional load of the spectacle finally hit him.
"All right," whispers one of the women.
"We know your heart is good.
You have had reasons for this."
Later, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one desk, the white couple from Atlanta lively discussing the spectacle with the black couple they just met.
Denise Dapplinski hardly finds words to describe how she feels after the play.
"It's hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After this, I think the lynching is still happening," she adds, "but now it's called the police shooting."
In another corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, shared his attention.
He says he's already starting to plan the next year's submission.
"The determination is encouraging, because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not learn their story and who do not know their story are condemned to repeat it."
The Court fined Naval for violations on “Aguitation Saturday”
The Simon's Court of Moscow fined Alexey Naval for a 300,000-roubles violation of the organization of the meeting.
The opponent was found guilty of an administrative offence, as provided for in article 20, paragraph 8, of the CAP of the RF “Return violation of the organization of the meeting”.
Earlier, Judge of the Simon's Court of Mosque Hezir Mussakaev concluded the administrative case with respect to Leonid Volkova, head of headquarters of the opposition officer Alexey Naval, who had been brought to justice under the same article as Naval.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of leaflets on “Aguitation Saturday”, which Naval supporters held in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
Having seen the agitmaterials following the Saturday, the police felt that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed it, the public action (to which the capital authorities had to ask prior permission).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zdanov and Alexander Pomazuyv, have sought an end to administrative proceedings owing to the absence of a crime and have indicated that the police have made some mistakes in the preparation of the protocol.
On the "Aguitation Saturday" itself, Volkov had not been detained, but he had received an agenda requiring him to appear at the police station to report on an event carried out with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Naval and by another opposition officer, Nikolaskin.
In Mordovia, the firing bride and three wedding guests were arrested
The court in Mordovia arrested the local resident who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported to the Republican Office of the Investigation Committee.
The incident occurred in the evening of 29 July.
During the dispute, a 42-year-old resident of Saranska shot several times at the guests of the events on the village pond to bury.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under article 213, paragraph 1, “a” of the Criminal Code (“Huligence”), article 30, paragraphs 3, “a”, “e”, “and” of article 105, paragraph 2, of the Criminal Code (“Attempt for the murder of two or more persons perpetrated in a commonly dangerous manner by Huligan motivation”.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened the shootings because the wedding guests decided to bury their property to the water.
Minergo will increase the requirements for turbine suppliers for power plants
The Ministry of Energy will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
At the start of gas turbines, GEC turbines, oil-consuming facilities and oil-producing oil, equipment suppliers will be required to share information on access to it with Minergo and the Federal Technical and Export Control Service.
The draft decision of the Government was already ready and put forward for public discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document, such as information and access to the management of foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unfair partners and hackers.
European Union expanded anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The European Press Service stated on 4 August that the anti-Russian sanctions had been expanded because of a scandal around Simens production turbines in Crum.
This has been reported earlier by the “Arguments of the Week”.
The EU Board Press Service stated that the sanctions against the RFs were expanded because of the Simens turbinal scandal, which was allegedly brought to Crym in sanction.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to increase anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be taken before the end of the day, and the decision was taken that the sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Pierson reduces 3,000 more jobs and reduces the dividends to get the business back to life
On Friday, the British educational group Pierson announced that it would reduce 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of prior dividends by 72 per cent as a result of the start of a regular restructuring programme aimed at addressing the problems facing their business.
These job reductions, which, according to John Fallon, will take place mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, take place in an addendum to 4,000 jobs that have been reduced during the previous restructuring.
Pirson announced that he was planning to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May during the third cost-reduction programme to try to rebuild the business that had hit the rapid transition to digital learning techniques.
A company that had agreed to sell its share in the publication “Penguin Random House” to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its projections for a year remained unchanged after she announced a 1 per cent increase in the sale of the major goods in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier died as a result of the death bombing
According to information from official sources, a suicide terrorist attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and translators were injured, as NATO ' s report states.
According to unveiled data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the town area of Karabakh.
This explosion is the last of the bloodshed that struck Afghanistan this month: on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide terrorist killed two people at the Embassy of Iraq in Kabul.
NATO reported that the explosion that took place on Thursday evening had occurred when a joint convoy with an army of Afghanistan was attacked by “a man-made explosive device”.
All wounded are reportedly in stable condition and treated at the American Military Hospital at the Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IU) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for the NATO forces located nearby in Bagram.
The United Nations reports that at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 and about 20 per cent of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the suicide bombing on a car caused the death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban claimed they had attacked.
On 31 May, a powerful explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people — the most serious of human casualties in the country since the United States troops disembarked the Taliban in 2001.
Violence is stressing the insecure situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States assesses whether there is a need to increase the number of United States military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to correspondents, terrorist attacks in Kabul over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana.
The Environmental Protection Agency, following judicial action, rescinds the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act
The American Environment Agency has revoked the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama Age Act, which requires States to limit air pollution emissions one day after 15 States have submitted to the agency for trial.
In the evening on Wednesday, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called ozone measurements 2015, emphasizing that this step demonstrates the readiness of the Agency to cooperate with the States.
“We believe in and feedback with our State partners”, said Scott Prüitt, leader of the Environment Agency.
In June, Prüitt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to postpone the measurements of ozone in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it to meet more strict air purity standards for one year until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, together with the federal district of Colombia filed a claim that this intention was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to retract a wide range of environmental protection decisions introduced by the previous President Barak Obama through a broader programme aimed, according to Tramp, at brilliant economic growth.
However, action in this regard has caused resistance by democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency ' s website states that the use of ozone air to breathe “can deteriorate the function of light and enhance respiratory symptoms”, such as as asthma.
The European Business Association opposed the new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association disagreed with the economic sanctions of the United States against the RF.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and employment.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, and therefore the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European Business comprises more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls upon the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from policy and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies request the police to limit traffic on the Coast in Pskov
The Pskov People's Elections addressed the UMVD Chief in the city of Sergei Surien on the problem of movement on the Great River.
Deputies of the hordes of Constantine Bolotin, Gregory of the Parties and Valerie Lesnikov, believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their view, control of drivers would help to make the Territory safer and safer.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the “Pedestrian track” and are free to ride on the coastal side.
It turns out that capital repairs and maintenance have been futile.
Sports and children's areas are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, the Central Coast Patrol and Women are patrolled in the evenings.
This reduces the number of cars travelling, but does not stop completely.
Putin demanded no rigid discs from the investigative authorities

British actor Robert Hardy died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Faja in screening the Harry Potter series of novels, died at the age of 92.
This was reported on Thursday in the Independent newspaper.

Hardy was born in 1925 in the English Celtnham resort.
In 1959, at the stage of the Royal Shakespearean Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier at the Tragedius of Coriolan.
Hardie also remembered the repeated implementation of the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including one of the screenings of Agatha Kristi about Miss Marple.

MID of Russia called on Washington to stop helming Moscow
In the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pens, who accused Moscow of destabilizing the Balkans, responded.
The relevant statement by the foreign policy department was circulated some time ago.
In its commentary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps that were inappropriate of modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the United States authorities to stop shabbling the RF.
As the Week Arms were written before, U.S. vice president Mike Pens accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the western Balkans and organizing an unsuccessful state-of-turbation in Montenegro.
Mike García and Vasili Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive team.
Vasili Lomachenko and Mike García, who appear to be steadily moving towards the most exciting boxing game, weighing up to £ 147 in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the ESPN-Category in Los Angeles until Garcia, an invincible champion in the lightweight of the World Boxing Council, went through the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World's champion of boxership in the second half weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over the former world championship in four weight categories, Erien Broner on Saturday, both sidekers are in five of the best boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said: ‘ How are you doing, champ?
Good luck with you."
Lomachenko protects his belt in a meeting with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers called for a photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Climas noticed that the potential decisive battle between them would be the most important.
"I used to be half weighted," reminisced Garcia.
“I went to the Broner’s [up to £140] category, but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to half the light.
And he's gonna have to go up to half of [up to £135], and then we're gonna have a team.
That's what the hospitals want.
Let us make it for them.’
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxo needs this one.”
Climas asked whether the battle should be broadcast through the PPV service as part of the strategy to be followed by Lomachenko to carry out his debate battle of 135 later this year to appoint a meeting with Garcia (37-0,30 Nocauts) for the next summer, which is also interested in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares and Luc Campbelle fight for the title of the champion of the world in the lightweight in the Forum on 23 September.
“The fight may be on PPV because all the indoors have been asked to do so,” said Garcia, expressing the willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other names will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready,
Garcia said that Lomachenko considered it to be a “wonderful boxer” and could be visiting his Saturday.
But Lomachenko did not immediately screw up García with commendation and said that in his opinion, the champion of three weights from Riverside looked “very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout.”
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the blow and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tensions of their own.
“This fight must take place.
No other battle is of so much interest and of conversation.
I am more than happy to work for him," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for someone of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great battle."

Putin commissioned the Hencourt Procurator to check on Baikal.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, commissioned the Attorney-General ' s Office of the RF to conduct a review of Baikal territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“Please check the Baikal Territory for illegal and environmentally harmful activities”, said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked for action if the violations were to be identified.
New test results have been published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the Swedish asylum-seekers tests that have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment show that more than 80 per cent of the protesters have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all have been assured of the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) criticized that it was unable to determine the present age of some refugees claiming to be minors.
The Migrationsverket has now sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic medical agency has now published 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were estimated to be 18 years old or older, and another 25 cases were assessed by the forensic agency that the test was “probably 18 years or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, it was stated that the person was “probably less than 18”.
The tests are conducted only when the age of the person is doubtful.
According to Johan Görnsson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the results of the past months.
“We have not seen a large difference in statistics in the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he said to the portal “The Local”.
The high proportion of cases in which people were estimated to have reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers were lying about their age.
In May, the agency published 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “the most likely age of 18 or more years tested”.
However, after considering the 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person had publicly stated that 18 had been accomplished this year.
The method of conducting a medical assessment of the age of making the teeth of wisdom and the imaging of knee joints and giving them an analysis to dentists and X-rays has also led to criticism in some institutions.
One of the skeptics, endocrinologists at the Carolina Institute of Claude Marcus, is a part of whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been sexually ripe earlier or later than normal.
“I have had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the measurements that are now being used.
Biological age is therefore very inaccurate.
If we can't determine it with confidence, we should not pretend we can,” he said to the newspaper “Metro”.
However, Gurancesen, a forensic agency, said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of adopting a child for a young adult may be wrong.
We are at the greatest risk when a person is about 18 years old, in which case he is about 10 per cent.”
I'm gonna think about getting to the president's office.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to think if he had to stand for the presidency of Russia in the 2018 elections, "Interfax".
This statement was a response to the request made by the residents of the village of Cheremushka in the Burat region.
During a video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buratia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words, “Vladimir Vladimirvirović, we ask you, when the next election of the President, we all ask you to meet again for this post”.
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," said the president in reply.
On 28 July, President Dmitry Peskov, the Spokesman of Russia, commented on the comments made by some media that Vladimir Putin ' s pre-election headquarters would be headed by President RF Anton Weino.
Sands called these assumptions "nothing based, hypothetical reasoning."
"As long as there are no headquarters, until the headquarters are built far away, before the electoral campaign is far away," said the Peaks.
"As long as it's on the agenda," said the Peak.
Governor of Western Virginia stated that he would move to another party
Governor of Western Virginia, representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justis announced on Thursday during a meeting with President Trump, who would move to another party.
"Would you like it or not, but the democrats have drifted away from me," said Governor Justis.
“Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... Today I tell you, the people of Western Virginia, that I can no longer be useful to you by staying a democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to a republican,” added Justis.
" As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play differently."
Trump had previously promised that an important statement would be made at the West Virginia meeting.
The Temple won 42 per cent in Western Virginia, and Justis did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillari Clinton.
Justis, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited a coal business from his father.
Its condition is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement on Thursday evening that “the transition of Governor Justis to another party is another blow on the Democratic Party, which is rather impeding than working to make our country again great”.
“In considering only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of state legislatures in history, a statement by Governor Justis is just another refusal of a party that has no leaders from above downstairs and cannot find a positive, communicating message”, reported in a statement by the CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Ronna McDenill.
Mr. Crashewick found the house thanks to the Societies.
A pilot in Pittsboro (Northern Carolina, U.S.A.) built a cat named Mr. Krasawczic weighing more than 14 pounds [14 kg] after he became famous because of the Internet.
Mashable tells us that.
At the end of June, a cat photograph was published in Facebook's book account and asked to find his owner because "he was obviously someone to feed."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's face could be a new memorial.
The publication received more than 3.2,000 rabbits and 15,000 commentaries.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to bring Mr. Crasawczic to their home.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee (Angela Frazee), who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview on the WNCN radio, a U.S. woman said that she had already had this experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 pounds [10 kg], and now it weighs a little over five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to an Australian cat with very long legs.
The post with the image of the animal collected over 68,000 views.
The commentators pointed out that she could quite make a career in model business.
Coe commended Russia ' s apology for the doping scandal
The International Athletics Specialist Sebastian Coe commended on Thursday what he described as a sincere apology on the part of Russia for the doping scandal but reiterated that it was now inappropriate to allow the country again to participate in sports competitions.
The Russian representative of Dmitry Pathin, a light athletic federation federation, reported at the Congress of the International Association of Low Athletic Federations, which was preceded by a light athletics championship, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all athletes who were stolen by gold and silver medals.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light Atomic Federations voted for the continuation of the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the found evidence of the use of doping financed by the State.
“I felt that today's response, today's report, were very sincere,” said President of the International Association of Light-Atletic Federations, to the reporters.
“All the council and all the Congress were pleased... that the Russian Federation itself would recognize that it was extremely hot times and that it was now doing its utmost to ensure that the Federation was restructured.”
Coe said he also “approved” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its recovery.
“I believe that this was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, which is not the time to restore Russia in the right,” said Coe.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our leading principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the impoverished system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, consistent with the strict criteria of the International Association of Light Atomic Federations, will be under the neutral flag to participate in the world championship on the light athletics that will begin on Friday in London.
The chairman of the special commission of the International Association of Light Atomic Federations, Rune Andersen, stated on Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met in order to rebuild Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London after a report made at the International Association of Light Atomic Federations council, drug testing is still not done in sufficient amounts, and the suspended coaches are still doing their work quietly.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being a hospital
Vasili Muravicki, a journalist who has been detained by the Ukrainian Security Service (SSC), was arrested for two months, handing over to the UKS.
The Journal of Gitomiri Internet publisher is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
In doing so, Russia does not support the Ukrainian authorities ' measures against a journalist, considering it a “varvarian policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The patrol ship “Comandante Borsini” entered the territorial waters of Libya in order to halt the influx of illegal migrants along with the Navy.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which did not control most of the country ' s territory.
The Libyan Parliament, against the Cabinet and based in Tobruk, accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his subordinate orders to oppose Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was stated that they did not believe in these threats and that they intended to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations of the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan Cabinet Faiz Saraj, recognized by Europe.
The Italian authorities have begun to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration since the promulgation in July of the number of nonlegals coming to the country from Libya: 95,000 people from the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A massive crash occurred in Skype
A global failure in the Skype service has been recorded in several countries today.
On Thursday, 3 August, users began to send massive complaints to the programme developers.
Microsoft stressed that experts were already working actively to address the problems faced by European and North Americans, clarifying the News RIA.
Remember, this year in June, Skype also had an accident.
Users were unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two team leaders on light athletics have been dismissed from participating in the PM
Olga Earthk and Olesi Povch specializing in the short run are excluded from Ukraine's 2017 peace championship in London.
This is reported on the Federation of Easy Athletics (FLAU) website.
This decision was taken by the executive of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against light athletes by the International Association of Light Atomic Federations (IAAF).
The Ukrainian delegation also excluded the coach, Earthk Sergei Basenko.
According to Sportarena, IAAF suspects athletes of doping.
Inch is the Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the European Championship 2010, the estaphate 4 to 100 metres, the Landk winner of the European Primary, 2012, at the estaphate of 4 to 400 metres.
A light athletics champion in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neyamara's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending on European football clubs will not prevent the world record of Neyemar's transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Saint Jerman.
Whatever the consequences may be further on the chain, for the Paris Saint-German, UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, whose authorities prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious tournament of the League of Champions.
From the Financial Fair-Play Rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it is clear that the UFA will eventually have to show that the transfer of Nymear was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) only to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Naymar would receive a salary that would reach ten million dollars a year.
These are some financial aspects of Neimar's relocation to France.
The SPW can definitely dissolve to hire Neimar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the rich energy of the ruling Qatar family.
The clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them with legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FPU introduced Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007.
The former French soccerist believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their pursuit of success, in fact, cheated and risked destruction if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FPF stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abrahamovich in Chelsea in 2003 — to buy a club with good potential and then to spend seriously to improve the team and create a world brand — became a difficult plan.
During this three-year evaluation period of 2018, clubs may lose 30 million euros.
And even though Platini was embarrassed to withdraw from the presidential office in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Cheferin, is still determined to control excessive spending.
The FPL is alive, and we will move forward to tighten the rules,” said Andrea Traverso, Associated Press last week, controlling the FP at UEFA.
Although the SPW is paying a lump sum of Neyar contract at one time, it can distribute this amount for the entire period of his contract.
Nymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual reporting as Euro44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of the PFP sanctions in 2014, the SWC, as well as the Abu Dhabi Manchester City, had been subjected to severe sanctions.
The SPG was fined 60 million euros (at that rate $82 million), which was later reduced to Euro20 million, and it was ordered to limit the composition of its team at the Liga Champion during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
WEFA monitors clubs that may attempt to overtake its financial inspections by damaging their revenues from companies associated with the club owners.
While the Qatar company could offer the SPL, if the amount considered to be higher than the standard market rates, WEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
That was the case in 2014, when WEFA decided that the funding of the SPLM from the Qatar Tourism Office had been dispersed.
It was reported that part of Neimar’s earnings in the SPLM could be paid by the organizational committee of the 2022 peace championship in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Naymar will be ambassador to the world championship, and such a maneuver could easily be discovered by WEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the SPL mean that the WEFA will be more careful to monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by acquaintances, WEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions on the transfer of Nimir.
They communicated with Associated Press on anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the SPL.
According to the latest published report, PMW received more than €10 million from the turnover of Euro542.4 million in 2015 to 1016.
Reports for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
SPW expects Neyar's arrival to be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, the sale of attributes and t-shirts with a team logo.
At the club, it is assumed that it will grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the new player’s recruitment.
Undoubtedly dissatisfied by one of the best footballers, the Spanish League tried to hinder Neimir's transfer, stating that the SPW would break the financial "feir-glue".
“This is an obvious “financial doping”, with the club and the State,” stated President La Liga Havier Tebas in the Spanish newspaper, bearing in mind that Qatar is the final owner of the SPL.
Arsenala coach Arsen Hunger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnatu, shares La League's doubts about the financing of the State club.
“It's all the consequences of share, and it's completely changed the landscape of soccer over the past fifteen years,” said Hunger on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It's becoming very difficult to respect the financial frank, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
Order and place of oath will be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will pledge their commitment to the RF, the President will determine that such amendments to the second reading have been drafted in the relevant law by a committee of the Lords of Legislation and Statebuilding.
Even a week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the order in which to make an oath in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated, and the revised text of the amendments to the RF Citizenship Bill (Isvest), which the Committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of a sworn oath in the citizenship of the RF on 6 June during a meeting with Speaker of the Lord Vyacheslav Voldynim.
Deputies have introduced this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the Bill, which abolishes the decision on the extradition of nationality to those who have subsequently been convicted for a number of terrorist or extremist crimes, for example, for public appeals to terrorism or for public acquittal on the media or on the Internet (art. 2, para. 205.2. of the Criminal Code) and for the dismantling of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art. 2, para. 211, of the Criminal Code).
According to the Bill, the logic of the law was that by making documents for citizenship, a person would be signed under the promise of compliance with Russian law - putting him on the path of extremism, he violated that promise.
The draft law was introduced in April by leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasilla (“Single Russia”), Hennadium Zuganov (CRC), Vladimir Girinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (“Justice Russia”) and Speaker GD Vyacheslav Voldone.
On 19 May, the deputies accepted it on first reading.
Last week, the Statebuilding and Legislation Committee approved the text of the bill for second reading, but it has now been revised.
It now states that the President of the RF will set up the order to make the oath.
Previously, parliamentarians were about to describe the procedure directly in the Citizenship Act, stating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere before the State herb and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place, the list of locations where the herb of the RF could be located is governed by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include the courts, the Cabinets of Heads of State, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive branches, etc.
Most likely, this could be the GTA.
A solemn oath to those wishing to obtain the citizenship of the RF will be made after the officials checking their documents.
But the Russian passport is to be obtained only after the oath is made from the finalized text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath must precede the signature of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be vowed from 18 years, not 14 years old.
A rule was retained that those who could not pronounce, read or sign the oath on their own should be released from the vows of incapacity or limited capacity.
In addition, the President of the RF has the right to be freed from this procedure and “other persons”,
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for admission to Russian nationals of Ukraine who are considered Russian bearers.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an appropriate declaration to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A noteworthy copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Refusal of “external” nationality, as is the case now, will not be required if it is provided by an international treaty or if it cannot be “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
A group of deputies proposed an amendment to the law, including the first Vice Speaker of the DG Ivan Melnikov (CRC), Natalia Polyneska, Paul Kraseninnikov and Irat Farraov (all of which is “Single Russia").
I think many of you know it's not real, it's impossible.
Accordingly, very many people are awaiting a decision on the citizenship of the RF, explaining on the previous day the head of the Duma Committee on Statebuilding and Legislation, Paul Kasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on certain positions for foreigners would not extend to those who had renounced “other” nationality in writing and passed the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but “for reasons beyond its control” did not cease to be considered a national of another country.
Aliens are now forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be recruited for facilities and organizations related to the security of Russia.
A person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country may not also become a member of the Lord's Office or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is envisaged that the law should enter into force as of 1 September 2017, and the necessary sub-laws should be ready at that time.
Nostalgia becomes niche in the "Jark American summer" and "Teacher detective"
The current nastal history iteration reminds us at the same time of the famous days of characters in the 1980s; of the boundary in the 1990s (approximately when the outstanding masters of David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made a comedy of the State for MTV); and of themselves, in 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Radd, moved to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is the uplifting and embodiment of our era, with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchisa, she seems to be anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the Absurdist humor (including the original story of the bank-speaking vegetables that H. John Benjamin spoke).
The result is doubled by the general joke: middle-age actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood; thus, the inability to return becomes part of the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults play already, they have less emotional roots, and their vagueness is more unsystemable and includes reefs from stalker movies of the 1990s, like "The Rookie, Kicking the Wheel."
In one episode, the character gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller horses and a bunch of other things since 1991.
Many plot moves are the same.
Gentle Coop (Shoulter), now a writer, still failed to achieve reciprocity from Katie (Margerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has a virginity.
There's also a crazy and false conspiracy that Ronald Reagan (such as Schowalter), who is now instigated by George Bush-old (a tested parodia in the execution of Michael Jan Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchisa is the derogation.
It's especially funny to see young Raddy forever, who's singing Matt Dillon's song from "One-night," who's a character who's a big man named Andy now an old girl.
This franchise could be successful by random madness in the spirit of a recursive series “Seven Up” until it came to the point that I thought it would be a logical conclusion, “America's Horrible Summer: Twenty Years Later”, where the last stage of the entire company would go to a movie on the premiere of the Worst American summer.
The Detective Tourist in the Amazon turns to another kind of nostalgia: memories of the cold war from the Americans, the Explosive Blondie, or even the Blosska with its image of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gheitwood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Director Riz Thomas, depicts a television film: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s on two Bucharest policemen fighting for truth, atheism and Marxist-Leninian path.
The main roles of the visitor of Gregor and the idealist Josephus are Florin Piersik Junior and Cornelio Ulys, and their dialogues are in English by Chenning Tatum (he is the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levit.
It's a brilliant idea.
But just an idea.
There are some visual jokes (the police spend time watching a chess match like Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices for the footage, including Jenny Sleit, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Seviny, makes it interesting to play " guess the voice."
But the "Teacher detective" holds so close to the truth of a bizarre propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- which is often what it looks like.
Six long episodes are long, and it's a little funny.
If it were to be made shorter, the "Teacher detective" could better deal with its saturary in the spirit of an agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat men sitting in the billboard, swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
The imaginary Communist viewer, this image says western culture is capable of doing anything to make obese.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not that wrong: We do so even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The Russian Super Bowl Foundation for Soccer between Spartak and Lockomotive will be about 30 million roubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian soccer Prime League (RFPL) Sergei Pradkin for a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70 per cent of that amount, reports the RT.
He also added that to date there were almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotive match will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TAC notes, Spartacus is the current champion of the RF, and Lockomotive is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young Finns Cleaned a 200,000 roubles
A 37-year-old Finnish, with a furniture firm, has been contacted by the police on the day.
The man stated that he was stealing expensive tools from the circuit, which had caused serious damage to his production.
The mining of thieves was a total of nearly 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulic, a snail.
Intelligence began to search for criminals and soon came to Bashkortostan, 23-24-year-old citizens.
According to a press report from the Republic ' s Ministry of Internal Affairs, the accomplices penetrated the businesses, hacked the front door and delivered the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first car crashed.
Theft has already been initiated and the law enforcement agencies have been able to recover only some of the stolen instruments to the legal owner.
The Lord commented on the words of Medvedev on the relationship between the RF and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by the official representative of the State of Heather Naurt in response to the words of Prime Minister RF Dmitry Medvedev on the relations of the two States.
Previously, the head of the Russian Government stated that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the RF a full trade war.
Commenting on these words, Naurt acknowledged that Russian-American relations were “low-level”, but noted that it was necessary to seek “sharing areas”.
"Look at the truce in southwest Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," quotes diplomat RIA Newsty.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on a statement made by the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions amounted to a trade war.
The new Bill on Sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK, President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed last Wednesday.
In doing so, he acknowledged that the document had failed and was contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grows" roses from amethists and quartz
The French fashioned unit Dior - Dior Joaillerie - filled the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They had five new rings and three chicken on the bark tapes.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line releases two new rings and boxes from amethists, pink quartz and diamonds performed in glipstic techniques (whole stones) and respects the 70th anniversary of the house.
Head Dior Joaillerie Victouar de Castellan was inspired by roses growing in his place in Grannville by the modeler Christian Dior, and the Paris gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catelan.
The trump found the perpetrators of deteriorating relations with Russia
The U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the members of the Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relationship with Russia is at an unprecedented and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine," wrote the president on Twitter.
The new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK were signed before Donald Trump.
They will, inter alia, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated a presidential statement stating that the US law would not allow the US to enter into profitable transactions and would further bring the RF, China and North Korea closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur relinquished the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbanka
The employer from Belarus, Victor Procopenja, withdrew an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) for the purchase of his daughter's unit of Sberbank.
The businessman's decision explained to the RBC the intention to “concentrate on the other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokobeni, such a step would be “a better investment of time” despite the investment attractiveness of Sberban's daughter's purchase.
Mr. Prokopenja became the main buyer of a Russian bank unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the consortium of NorvikBank Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Guzerieev in July.
The Russian banks left the Ukrainian market after Peter Poroshenko, President of the country, imposed sanctions on their daughters in March.
Sberbank was one of these financial organizations, other than the ITC and Vines Econombank.
Novak called the cause of the blecauth in Crime.
In the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Energy called the cause of the Blecauth in Cruma.
The head of the department of Alexander Novak made an explanation of the incident.
He said that the peninsula had been left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the Krasnodar province.
The truck hit the electric transmission line, resulting in the disengagement of Cuban and related criminal networks.
Essential accidents in the power supply of large criminal cities were recorded last week.
Specialists have eliminated turmoil within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the blécauta could have caused anomalous heat.
The Bank of England will maintain the interest rate of 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England will later declare that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and diminishing inflation have caused rumours of possible increases to cease.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain ruthless and left the interest rates unchanged among the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank ' s Cash Policy Committee (MPC) voted against 6 to 2 for maintaining the rates of 0.25 per cent, with fewer members in that month calling for an increase in the rate because weak economic growth had weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its projections to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to about 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, the bank warned that the increase in rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation caused by the brequesit, and said that the costs of loans would probably have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of abandoning a part of the massive set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of the brequezite.
Since next February, the bank will close the emergency funding plan for which it provides banks with cheap loans, although it reported that it is now in the framework of this plan to provide an additional 15 billion pounds up to 115 billion pounds.
In a decision-making report on rates, the bank said: “Based by the main MPC projections, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while the pressure on real income of families continues to affect consumption”.
On the question of rates, he reiterated that a “somewhat tightening of financial policies” would be required in order to halt inflation in a small amount that was expected by the markets.
Currently, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be “steady” and “limited”.
The bank ' s projections for this and the next year are lower than those of May, which were 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has maintained its projection of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, sterling fell relative to the dollar and the euro.
Pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent unsatisfactory growth rates had diminished the expectation of an increase; GDP had then increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the increase is likely to remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it starts to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank ' s last inflation report gave little cause for joy to households, where high inflation and very low wage increases were hit by, according to the bank, pressures would increase before declining.
The Bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” earnings in the next few years, but expects that wages will be “significantly” restored by the end of its three-year projection.
The economy is also stemming from growing demand for British goods due to the low pound rate, which compensates for part of lower consumer costs.
A year after the last August, the rates had been reduced to 0.25 per cent after the shocking outcome of the referendum on exit from the European Union that had fallen.
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision at rates, there was a rise in noise around the expected increase in rates, as inflation had pressured households that were also severely pressured: three incoming professional committees had asked to increase the rate to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the past month, inflation fell to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and reimbursed in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher rate than the planned 2 per cent is the result of a low pound rate.
Andrew Montlake, director of the Koreko Ipotics brokers, said: “If you take into account the recent fall in swap courses, it appears that the mortgage market will again become even more competitive, as creditors demand business opportunities and look forward to a good end of the year.
The market is particularly favourable for those who are approaching the end of their existing treaties, as credit refinances, often with the possibility of a lack of commission and a low rate, are becoming more popular than ever.”
The State Health Service will record the controversial drug of 10,000 people
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for the prevention of HIV after the battle of the High Court on the financing of a drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposition prevention of HIV (PREP), a pill taken before sex, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in persons at risk by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service during the initial three years of testing of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the appeal court had upheld last year ' s decision of the High Court, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PREP despite its allegations that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step, which was announced on Thursday, was described as “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) described it as “the turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the programme throughout England, by April 2018, the Venerological Dispensers in London, Bryton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffilde will be among the first to register people, and even more диспансерs will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposition prevention (PREP) is a pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-existence pre-infected HIV-infected.
Studies have shown that the risk of HIV infection among people at risk is significantly reduced by the PREP.
When PREP is adopted before sex in the human body, there are enough certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be used daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to a drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose partners are HIV-positive and are not treated successfully.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have accepted the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is constrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and attributed to a doctor of common practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispenser participating in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England, this week after the international procurement tender, signed a drug contract.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PREPs to collect clinical data on who the target audience of the drug is, how much it is, and how much it is used.
“This most important innovation must complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone over more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, NAT President, National AIDS Control Office, stated: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PRE, if it is literally targeted on people in need of help and at risk, is an opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at the HIV risk group will have access to a new means to control, without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Jan Green, president of the Terrens Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first of all, it is necessary to ensure that the test is rapidly deployed throughout the country and that no HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we are provided with a pilot drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV.”
Sharon Hodgeson, the Tennis Minister of People's Health, said: “We welcome the beginning of the PREP test, it has been very late for months of delays and provocation by the Government”.
Data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this rocky infection.
This test will bring us closer to a full understanding of the advantages of the PRSP.
It is now important that the test be developed as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people at risk of HIV and move us to a step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The Tatar World Congress adopted a resolution on support for the Tatar and Russian Treaty
The sixth meeting of the Tatar World Congress (TAC) adopted a resolution in which it was important to retain the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a well-recommended form of organization of the highest State authority in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the distinction between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “has played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and social-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
Recall that the treaty between Moscow and Kazanya has been concluded for 10 years since 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, the Deputies of Gossowette Tatarstan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only member of the federation who has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is entitled “President”.
In Russia, difficulties have arisen in obtaining international driving rights
The HIBD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving permits (IWAs).
In order to obtain such rights, it is necessary to wait for a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers wishing to leave abroad on their own car or to take it over there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving permits remains controversial.
The MLC was introduced to make the foreign police easier to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information was made available in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, everything depends on a specific police or a leaky office: some require MLCs, while others require sufficient national rights.
To be insured, drivers of international law still receive, but it should be borne in mind that in non-ratification countries (e.g. the United States, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have the right not to recognize national rights or the IDPs.
There is now a problem with forms in virtually all units of the GIBDA, reports Commersant ' in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, IGADD units, the tallers are simply not issued, and the band is missing for four months.
You can be enrolled on the public service website, but the line has stretched to mid - August.
In the Krasnoyarsk, the MOU cannot be obtained “for technical reasons” without giving details, and in the Samaria area it is honest that there are no forms, and that the situation is similar in other cities.
Many Moscowians have already faced the problem, and social media reports are increasingly reported:
Irena Burmistrova, "Recognise why international rights cannot be obtained in Moscow?"
Right, because all the branches of the HYBDD are out of form.
Elena Podkolzina:
International rights must be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow it's all the time far ahead, there's no waist at all.
It would seem like the public service portal shows that in the SpB the free time before the fig.
Has anyone been receiving in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the requirements for international driving permits have changed, so new forms are being delivered to the Gosauto Inspectorate.
That could be the case with a deficit, but it was not clear what changes were involved before.
Blanки procure special purpose centre for road safety (OBDC) and then ship them to the HIPD units.
In recent years, all contracts had been contracted with AO “Puzzak”: in 2014-2015, nearly 200,000 MOU forms had been produced, 15,000 forms had been purchased in 2016, 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract had been concluded on 18 July with the OLA “First Printing Court” for the production of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that CNS just didn't have a tender on time, and that's why there's a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people have begun to travel on their own, not to Europe, but to the cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand, and so forth.
What rights are adopted there, to the end, is not clear, so people are being reinsured, so that there is a feasible demand for international “shorts”.
Recently it was known that professional drivers would have to pass an examination to confirm their qualifications.
That proposal was made by Mintrans.
The international driving permit (IHL) has been in operation since 31 May 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, stated that he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Krym.
On Friday, August 4th, he said to the portal Ombudsperson in an interview.
No respected international company would even put a chat or a chase there, because it would risk losing its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries that had acceded to the sanctions against Russia concerning Crime.
"That is, I am deeply convinced, there is no prospect for this project," said Petrenko.
He added that Russia was unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot properly build smaller objects.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, the stadiums have already begun to be destroyed.
“I believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so unprecedented to join the project,” said the official.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of a arch of the Krim Bridge.
A large assembly of the Krim Bridge road arch is completed on the cerechnae, which will be locked at a height of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“Sometimes bridge builders have prepared for the installation of the rail arch on the fairway walls”, reported at the project information centre.
In April, President Vladimir Putin, Head of Mintrans Maxim Sokolov, informed the Russian President that the construction of the site was ahead of the schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Cremian Peninsula and the Krasnodar Land.
In Spain, an official who did not go to work for 10 years was dismissed
What angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) was the chief of Spanish officials, Carles Recio?
Permanent stroll stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not your direct boss.
There's nothing in the bureaucracy world that can happen.
Origins seem to have been used to all the "servant of the people."
Nevertheless, officials have been able to surprise those on whom they live well.
This time, "censation" was complaining from Spain.
There, a Valencia Carles Recio archive officer had worked for ten years without going to work.
At the same time, he regularly received a complaint.
It's 50,000 euros a year.
And here's Mr. Recio's "wonderful Times."
He was dismissed by decision of the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it was found that the vicious walker went to the office every morning at 7:00 in order to be mentioned in the electronic system.
I went home immediately.
Once again, he was in work at 4:00 p.m. to remark in the system that he had left.
That's 10 years old.
It was also known that all the free time the walker spent drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly now think how to punish Mr. Recio, the direct head, who could not fail to know how to “actually work” in his workplace.
Suggested protection against the chairpersons
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRR) has, on instructions from Vladimir Putin, developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRT proposes to limit the powers of the chairpersons of the courts and to introduce their choices.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation, HRW wishes to establish special districts that will not be tied to an administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the Presidential Directive.
HRT has completed the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by Vladimir Putin on 3 January 2017, which the President gave after meeting with members of the Council.
At a meeting with Council members on 8 December 2016, some cases of judicial arbitraryity were discussed, as well as the problems of public control in the places of detention (see “United Nations” of 9 December).
The outcome of the work of the HRT was 25 proposals relating to both the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlev human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for a judge had successfully competed and received the support of the judicial community, the President of the court was of the view that he should be present to his appointment without the right to refuse, as the law now permits.
It is also proposed that the President be deprived of the right to share cases among judges.
Experts are allowed to do so, and they may have a written computer program.
The President also believes that he is not entitled to “determine the results of the qualification appraisal of the judge, initiate his disciplinary responsibility and decide on the establishment of additional material payments”.
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “elections of judges themselves” and to “confidentialize them for a relatively short term with mandatory rotation”.
All Presidents of the courts (from Republican to District) are now appointed by the President for six years upon presentation by the President of the Supreme Court of the RF.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the HR Committee proposes a new appeal and cassation before the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to an administrative and territorial division in the RF.
The HRT states that “the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation is required, not at the regional judicial level in the RF, but in the judicial districts.”
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts as a basis.
There are “trial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the RF, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials whose use of “telephone law” is difficult.
The HRT judges of the world propose that people be strengthened to deal with some “category of civil and administrative matters” with their participation.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, rehabilitation at work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's only our proposals," explained the U.S. member of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morszkakov.
She also recalled that the President ' s mandate was not only HR, but also to the Supreme Court (VC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time to perform the assignment of the BC (in the midst of the co-executors - Genocura and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the RF).
To report to Vladimir Putin how effective the independence of justice is being ensured in the RF, the President of the Vyacheslav Lebedev is due until 1 September.
Living a high life: semi-fastage and cunning designers turned this little apartment into Earls Cort into a spacious home.
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a space house in Nittsbridge to an apartment in Earls Cort in 2014.
The apartment's on the first floor of a nice model house in Queen Anna's style, and in favor of a new design, it says that Joan didn't gather her things and didn't move again.
“Before I lived with my ex in Nittsbridge in a much larger area,” says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Cort, and there were the same high ceilings here.
I fell in love with her and offered the price on the same day."
Since the first view of the apartment, a total renovation has been carried out by 1,000 square feet.
It was originally an apartment with one bedroom of complex planning — to get to the bedroom, we had to go through the kitchen — and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and a semi-fastage so as to get the best out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands," she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural study “Duck & Shed” to use ceilings of 12.5 feet high and to create a housing that would not only be a successful project but would be worth Joan for life.
The ceiling was not enough to build two spaces above the other, so the architectural task was to create a semi-fastage where it could be fully grown.
Erphan had to think creatively to deal with the briff.
"The steel work is very complicated," he explains.
“We had to place spaces so that they would stay on top of each other and not have to burst down.
It was not just a simple platform that had to be constructed, but a design that would allow them to be at the right altitude and to use spaces from top to bottom.”
This decision allowed Erphan to set up two full-scale rooms over one another in a fixed space -- and much more interesting.
From the semiset through the guinea meat light from Retrouvius opens a view of a fabulous living room below.
Star furniture with gold, silver accents and guinea lighting devices from Serge Muy set a project style.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacularness, space and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror protective panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's utensils.
To create a sense of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can be blocked by a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new about the cooking kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a sliding door upstairs like in the garage.
"It was engineering here," Erphan's story of an armed wood-walled shield door.
"She's equipped with an anti-waste, so when you push the door up, it's very easy to slide."
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“In the end, the sex area is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated,” says Erphan.
“In fact, the real estate agent will enter and make calculations on the basis of the gender area.”
They have been able to increase the sex area by using quality materials that provide the area of luxury.
“The material is what we touch, so it helps to create an emotional relationship with the house,” says Erphan.
“No one is in love with the electric wire in the walls.
It is important, but it does not strike the strings of our hearts.”
It's evidence that with good design and increased yardsticks, the apartment can turn from something normal into something amazing.
Actually, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government approved the establishment of a Cultural Policy Commission
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a Commission on Public Cultural Policy.
The decision was issued on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy implementation.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the Commission has been appointed Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
The Prime Minister of the RF, Dmitry Medvedev, approved the plan for the implementation of the State Cultural Policy strategy in 2016 until 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and includes measures to increase the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries declined to a minimum of eight years
The increase in consumer prices in G20 countries has decreased to minimum values over the last eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal with reference to data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Previously, Rostat reported a reduction in the consumer price index of 0.1 per cent in Russia.
The Department thus recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
Inflation Target in Russia is estimated to be 4.1 per cent.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs, however, believes that the target has already been achieved, in the version of the department, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal cutting of Baikala taiga
The Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during the meeting on environmental development in the Baikal Territory, warned against illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Sergei Donski, Minister of Natural Resources, noted that a bill had previously been drafted.
It permits the deforestation of forests during the fire disposal, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President stated that the project should be monitored to ensure that, in the process of cutting out, "all in a row."
Donski noted that the bill involved monitoring by the MSD and oversight agencies.
The media: VSO fighters are secretly contracted with the Donbas militia from the command
On an armed confrontation line in Donbasse, a regular telephone connection has been established.
The warriors of the opposing parties are constantly interacting with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known at headquarters.
The BSO and the Donbas militia have established cellular communication secretly from their high command.
This is reported on 4 August by Strana.ua with reference to the military operations in Donbassa.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know well the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily on telephone.
Communication is not domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical arrangements”.
Part of the result of such conversations is the truce on a certain part of the front.
Journalists were aware of the occasions when an officer received congratulations on the day of birth from the front line from his formal enemy.
The GDP and the DNR and LNR militias have been sitting in the trenches on the border line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a military operation against Donbassa.
The Ministry of Internal Oversight Services has dismayed the blocking of UNSB attacks on the Embassy of the RF
In the Russian foreign policy department, the actions of selected Western diplomatic representatives, which block the statements of the United Nations Sowbez in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the Embassy of the RF in Syria, are outraged.
This is reported by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The department recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus was subjected to mortar shelling on 2 August three times a month by terrorists from Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham (former Jabhat An-Nusra, banned in the RF) and Fileak Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community is united in the qualifications of Nusra as a terrorist organization, and UNSB resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the MID RF noted that “it would appear, in itself, that the Nusra terrorists should face a general unconditional and strong condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the assessment of the elbows against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed in the Diplomacy, “every three times a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council have blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemn terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital.”
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us may remain on the conscience of those delegations.
“Awkwardly, the inability of the Security Council to condemn terrorist acts to new provocations and terrorists gives them a sense of impunity,” said the Ministry of Justice, adding that “they would not like to have a conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin was in favour of limiting the number of out-of-plan audits of business
President Vladimir Putin of Russia, during an investment project meeting in the Far East, stated that the number of unplanned entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30 per cent of the number of planned inspections, as well as the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
“Of course, unplanned checks are carried out without agreement with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office; only 2-3 per cent are in line with the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, everything else is being done on its own”, quotes the President of the TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should ban servers and hard disks on businesses.
Furthermore, the President considered that business unions should be entitled to protect the interests of their members in the court.
“This, I hope, will have some positive effect on business cases or business violations,” said the Head of State.
As reported by the U.S., the moratorium on planned inspections increases the number of other types of entrepreneurial inspections.
In May, a survey was carried out by the President of Russia, Boris Titus, which revealed that plans were actually replaced by out-of-plan (from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), the prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), the raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and the checks on citizens ' claims (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers fight for a real estate value of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest real estate empires in Victoria, worth over 500 million dollars, 40 years after their Italian ancestors established a dynasty.
The former director of the Carlton soccer club and the builder, Colin de Lutis, live in the Turk palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him to the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is in the process of provoking an aggressive dispute about the conditions of divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 objects worth over half a billion dollars bought since their family purchased a shop at Smit Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded the Westco Jeans company, which grew into a network of 160 trade points.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
Money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list includes office buildings today, sites under construction in Brunswick and Sorrento, flats on the Golden Bank and Mount Buller and trade centres in suburbs.
In agreement with the deceased father, Colin, whom Paul describes as the “primary driving force and dominant person” of the de Lutis family, has about two thirds of the assets of the company and Paul has about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colin’s property is 316 million and Paul’s property is 176 million.
The division of property and money was a stumbling block for Paul.
"Divorce proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, following several failed attempts to reconcile, the first hearings were held before the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now controversial about who will control the existing business - of which, in Paul's view, Colin disfellowshipped him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but he accuses Paul of uncompetent management of certain objects.
In the testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped that the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family to be the highest priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenses are growing as a snow-com: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and reports of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and the Charter of Keck Cramer; both sides have attracted the most prominent lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Mayers, and the best stripes.
Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they had managed dairy bars and hastronomers and had purchased a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
Under financial guarantee, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of jeans.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last class of school, and Paul was a boy at the time (approximately 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
"Luiji often told me he didn't want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the de Lucis group; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he got out of business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were “satisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL Club and, according to the biography published in 2015 by Eddie McGir, the best friend of television.
Ferfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Responding only to Colin, a text message stating that since the case had not yet been tried, “I have not really had nothing to say”.
"I'm very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a suit against me and to scratch the name of our family in court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he tried to meet the brother’s requirements.
"Our father wouldn't like to see how Paul and I disputed before the court," he said, adding that "he still hopes to resolve the conflict."
This hope must have been dissolved on Friday.
"The decision in our case will be brought to justice soon," wrote Colin.
The new head of the Trump is planning to limit information to the President.
Others have tried to do so and have been defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that.
In that case he'll be the first.
“Political” reports that the new head of the White House apparatus is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tramp, including news reports from the media, with the hope of keeping the Chief in a calmer state.
That's what the reporter Josh Dowzi reports.
“A meeting held by John F. Kelly, a new head of the White House apparatus on his first working day, he identified the main problem in the White House of President Donald Trampe, which he hoped to decide: bad channels of information to the President.”
Kelly told the staff that the information should be made through it, in paper or through briefings, because the President would be better off taking decisions if he received the correct information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is perfectly correct, but others have already failed in trying to reconcile the Tempa by tracking the receipt of information.
The relationship between President Trump and television a few decades ago, and now, when he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When the Trump, as a candidate, was resented by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had been given fair coverage in publications that could be reconciled," said Sam Nanberg, a former electoral adviser in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that “the six former members of the electoral headquarters had to keep under control the Trampa habit of writing in Twitter to ensure that the information they received was a constant flow of praise.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's habit of writing on Twitter has ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Maybe those members of the electoral headquarters know something we don't know, for example, that if they weren't, the tweets of the Tram would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump hasn't published.
If his staff had spared him at least several times, their efforts were not futile.
But no one ever managed to keep the Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving the Tramp material, whether reliable or not, which confirms their views.
The politician, just to this story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to continually supply the President with doubtful information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shein Goldmaker:
"Non-one and former Trump staff say that Trump can react very severely to negative press reports, especially with dangerous leaks of information, and will not calm until he finds who was behind them.
That's what happened at the end of February, when someone pushed the President to print an article with GotNews.com, a website of Charles K. Johnson's Internet provocator, where Kathy Walsh, the deputy head of the apparatus, was accused of being “standing for a few leaks” in the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson is forever banned in Twitter for his aggressive conduct, that he has not provided specific facts or that in the past he has filed false accusations and then abandoned them.
The trump read the article and began to question the staff members about Wells.”
Goldmaker adds that the then head of Rynes Pribus and the secretary of Rob Porter's apparatus tried to build a system to manage and document the Trump flow of papers.
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
He may be more effective manager than Pribus, but the Tramp still has impulsive nature, and his assistants continue to fight with each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumen Procuratorate fights with HIV Discipline
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office challenged the Order of the Kalinin Ridge Court of Tumeni, which terminated criminal proceedings against a local resident whose HIV-related daughter died of a young child.
As a result, the child was killed because the mother was HIV-disciplined and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor considers that the crime cannot be left unpunished to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case of the Tumeni resident was initiated at 1109 p.m. in April, after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection 4B.
According to the Public Prosecutor ' s Office, the mother is herself HIV-infected.
“Women did not treat herself and refused the treatment of her daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection,” explained the Tumen Procuratorate.
The criminal case was filed in the Kalinin Ridge Court of Tumeni, which decided on 25 July to terminate it.
The father of the deceased girl made this appeal, explained that “the woman has forgiven, she has no claim, she has done the harm and has apologized”.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office did not agree with the court ' s decision and appealed, requiring the discontinuation of the case and the resumption of it.
The girl died, and it is impossible to mitigate the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to survey and treat the baby with dangerous infections”, reported in the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
In the opinion of the oversight body, it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents would follow its example.
As reported at the Tuman AIDS Centre, some 12 children living with HIV are now not receiving medical care because of parental refusal.
"And this situation has improved -- in the year of the ad hoc group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV have changed their opinions -- have allowed for diagnostic and medication," said the Spokesman for the AIDS Centre, Elena Loev.
She said that it was not possible to influence parents in legislation and that not all HIV-positive children were able to detect - mothers did not allow them to be examined, hided, fled from hospitals.
The risk of HIV dissidents
At the end of last year, Petherburg Sociologists presented the results of the first Russian study of the so-called HIV-discipline movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny HIV and refuse to take drugs.
Medicines and AIDS service NCBs refer to such views as antimedicine, and they face a serious threat in their proliferation.
A terrible photo session that ended with a tragedy took place on Thursday, 3 August, at the Greek railway station in Khmelnik.
A cheerful company of elevated young people walked through a bridge over the railways, where a truck train was just standing.
One of the friends had an idea of making an effective selphi on the roof of the train, and had reported to FACTAM in the Hmelnic police communication sector.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his indifference, he was trapped by the line of electrical transmission and was instantly hit by a current.
Fortunately, this case was known to the station manager, who immediately caused an "until".
Prior to the arrival of the victim, the doctors were transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized to the Hospital in the Hospital of the Hmelnicka District Clinical Hospital.
The men had to diagnosed torso burns from 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now regarded as stable.
The law enforcement officials recall that in recent times extreme selphis on rooftops, bridges, and traffic have become increasingly popular.
The police encourage people to be vigilant and to avoid such photosessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists Approved Oceans in Ancient Venus
Ancient Venus could have had oceans.
This was the assumption made by French scientists.
Scientists have developed a computer model that has demonstrated the water education process on planetary surfaces, writes Science News.
It turns out that at the beginning of its history, the oceans in Venus had 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" reported that according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars four billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were wounded as a result of the shooting in the San Francisco Park
In San Francisco, three people were wounded by the shooting, transmitting the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park when there was a significant number of visitors.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting people.
The outward appearance of wrongdoers could not be considered because they had closed everything except their eyes.
Another was provided with medical care, after which he was released.
The third injured was a minor, no details about his condition.
The Dolores Park Hill is a popular place among local residents and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 people were injured during the shooting at the night club in the town of Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured in trying to leave the premises.

Gypsies crossed the roams and returned to the “millionaire street”
Some of the most wealthy West Midland owners are again in conflict with the resolute Gypsies who have overcome the dug-drawn municipal authorities to reopen the field near their homes.
The Gypsies parked 20 houses on the wheelchairs in a field bordering the rich street of Solikhal, which was a jolly name for the streets of millions.
Having brought with them horses, infants and many homes on the wheelhouses, they returned after they were driven not further than in May, and they had not been hindered by the roams dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their incursions.
This tactical company found a break in defence facilities and resisted its vehicles through a section that had not been fenced to leave a track.
The riots attacked the Municipality of Solihal, saying that he was “incapable of solving the problem”.
The anonymous local resident said, "They came here on Monday night after they were driven from Bentley Hit, where they were scraping stones in the passersby."
Municipality should be embarrassed and forced to act because they are totally unable to solve the problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven away, and they returned.
More Roma came last night, maybe even more today.
“The Municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial orders to protect their parks”, she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I continue to pay the municipal tax, and the municipality cannot even put an end to this.”
A local resident who wanted to remain anonymous said, “It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leaving the previous time, and please, this attack continues.”
This time they became more, and we even saw the horse grazing in the meadows."
The representative of the Municipality of Solikhalla stated: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground near Stratsbrook Road and cooperate with the Solikhalle police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them as soon as possible”.
To help us collect evidence, it is essential that as many local residents report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the telephone police 101.
This provides an overview of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Champagne wine plant "New Light" shares the crisis.
The GUP of the Republic of Krym “The Envoy of the Champanian Vines “New Light”” has decided to accede, converting to the OAO “The Envoy of Champanish Wins “New Light””, followed by the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations, Krym Anna Annuchin.
100 per cent of the shares of the business will remain in the State of Crime.
The statutory capital of the equity society will be 595.5 million roubles and consist of 5.955 million common shares with nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crime stated that if there were no funds to modernize the factory over the next three years, there would be a risk of stopping the factory.
The main cost of the enterprise is about 60 to 70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion roubles to be modernized, and because of organizational and legal features it is obliged to pay 50 per cent of its income to the budget.
What remained is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"Take money from the owner problematic, talking about borrowing money from large credit organizations difficultly," said the Minselhos of Crim Sergei Petellin in April this year.
The Crimea Parliament included the enterprise in the projection plan for privatization for 2017.
It was suggested that it should be stocked and traded.
The source of Interfax in the authorities of Crima estimated the possible value of selling the enterprise at $40 million, investor investments in modernization, an additional $30 million.
New Light increased the production of grythy wines by 2.8 per cent in 2016 compared to the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New Light intended to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the prince of Lviv Golitzin as a factory of grying wine in the new world’s acquired name.
The breed is located on 11 acres [11 ha] of land.
Less urban third graders have broken up more than 40 graves
MINU personnel in the Low City area have identified the identity of citizens who have destroyed 46 gravestones at the town of Liskovo cemetery.
A third - grade pupils proved to be malicious.
The first statement that the cemeteries were damaged by unknown plates was made in the Russian OICA in the LISK region on 27 June.
On this occasion, 24 persons were contacted by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was instituted under article 244 of the Criminal Code, “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police have established suspects, with two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years of age.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested to see how the monuments were falling, and that prompted them to do bullying.
Preventive measures have been undertaken with children and their parents.
Italy increases the tone of NGO ships saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs that belonged to rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they complied with the new regulations governing their activities.
“If NGOs fail to comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities,” said Mario Minnit, Minister of the Interior, in an interview with the Tourin daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning to Miniti was issued the following day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rette, suspected that its crew was actually cooperating with traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had worked for a year, had renounced the substantive comments of the detailed charges against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrodo Cartozio.
“For us the salvation of human life is and will remain the highest priority, so we regret very much that we cannot now continue to work in the search and rescue zone,” states the statement of the organization in social networks.
"We will be able to assess all the charges currently put forward, only after we have collected all the information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have followed the Juventa vessel owned by Jugend Rette since October.
His crew is suspected that he took a whole lifeboat on board migrants, whom traffickers sent directly to them, and allowed smugglers to leave with the boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting was projected to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, as alleged in the prosecution ' s reports, which were published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities who control rescue operations in the area, rather from humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct presupposes that mostly the Juventa courts will be held on board a Italian police officer to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to submit to the Code: “Sleep the Children”, Maltese MLAS and “Pro-Activa Proproproprospertty Crops” from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary but admissible, provided that they did not involve any “significant changes or interference” in its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize of Victims Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minni said that the sharp decline in the number of migrants coming to Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal safety and local mayors' cooperation were fruitful.
"In the last days we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict."
The authorities of the RF have recently intensified their policy on the Libyan side, and delegations of the rival Libyan parties have become part of the visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian Contact Group on Intra-Lebilisian Settlement with the MID RF and the Gosduma, Assistant Head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Mohgov, described the “U” objectives that Moscow pursues in the region and on whom the bet is making.
The Libyan contact group you lead is almost unknown.
So, let's say the Ukrainian contact group -- everybody knows about it.
And there's a cover of secrets.
What are your specific goals?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the MID RF and the State Duma.
Its work is supervised by the Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya).
The latter is authorized to work in Libyan direction by the Speaker of the Lord of Vyacheslav Voldynim.
The detention of the Russian tanker Mehanic Chebotarev in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We thought about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group from military professionals, representatives of the Lord, was established, and our work was supported by Chechnya Ramsan Kadirov, head of Chechnya.
How did it turn out to be your head?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to take the lead in the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the liberation of sailors from Mehanic Chebotarev.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups confronting each other in the Libyan conflict - and on the side of Tripoli (where the UN recognized Government is headed by Faiz Sarajem. - U.) and Tobruk (the Parliamentary Resolution that is opposing the Government and supports Marshal Khalif Haftar, which controls the eastern parts of Libya. - U.S.).
With the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice-premier of Libya - U.S.), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to establish a contact group to make better use of these contacts.
Its task is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict, we are engaged in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
The contact group now consists of five people.
Among them are people with experience in the forces, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include RAN, a group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Middle East Institute.
There is no one permanently in Libya of our staff, and that is not necessary.
Is there any Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military professionals in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not valid.
But your contact group is included in the former military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot points.
Or such closed towns as Misurata (where the militias are based) that have played a role in overthrowing the Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi in 2011 and are notablely active in subsequent years.
We came to Misurata in January this year.
We were scared, we were told that everything was Islamist, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to examine the real military potential, who is responsible for why such rumors are going, what the role of the Islamists is actually there.
In Misurat, we met with all the members of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean Coast was captured by militia banned in Russia by the Islamic State, U.S.).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to check the information that they had played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalif Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you conclude?
The Islamic State in Libya won not Haftar?
He wasn't doing that.
Haftar was carrying out operations on another front, in Bengazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, there were structures under the Government in Tripoli.
And by the way, we have invited the people in Russia who did this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived -- the visit continued from 19 to 23 April this year, and the Libyan delegation was admitted to the Council of the Federation, in Duma, MID and Rosgwardia.
You, as we have understood, are in all Libyan regions and are likely to have the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire arrangements, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris in Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saraj, could be implemented?
Or, again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be terminated, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to the next meeting has been a good signal for us, not long ago was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have very negatively addressed each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurat, and Haftar was on that day on board the Russian Air Forceносer Admiral Kuznets.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurati, they did not believe in coincidence.
They said, "You must be very courageous people who came to us today."
But our task is to demonstrate that we do not support only Haftar, we are engaged in dialogue with all the key players in the Libyan conflict.
You and Haftar were communicating.
Does understanding with Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he was studying twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian, if he knows, it's relative.
But what we have learned, of course, makes it easier for us to engage in dialogue with him.
And not only with him, among other things.
When we associate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they're pretty Russian.
And they're going to get to Russia, to some extent they're experiencing nostalgies over it.
Do you consider the likely abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
Of course, they are interested, but, as I said before, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not want to arm one another at the expense of others.
We would like everyone to be in some equal positions.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyan people have consistently called for Russia to contribute to its withdrawal.
Libya is now actively pursuing the process of drafting a constitution.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions, and that there will be an internal consensus.
The elections that Saraj and Haftar had also been discussed should then be held.
If the elections are to take place and will finally be elected by legitimacy (and no party now has such status), the issue of lifting the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations Sowbez.
To raise this issue is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to the escalation of the conflict.
On the day in the media, it was reported that Italy, which faced the problem of African refugees swimming from Libya, felt abandoned by EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation, using its relationship with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the Haftar troops to control the coast and to put an end to the smuggling business of immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need the support of Russia because Moscow has a dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj and Misurata and the south.
In that regard, tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
It's about the South curbing the flows of migrants from far-reaching areas?
So, in a sense, the buses that the Nigerian migrants drive back?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in continuing these flows.
We hope, however, to help combine the South in the negotiating process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of Government in Tripoli Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, a supporter of sharia rules in the country.
How radical is it?
Would that not be an obstacle in establishing relations with Russia or the West?
I'll express my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself maintains that Libya must be a perfectly normal country, a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he also actively fights terrorists.
Where did he get that reputation?
It has been established by those countries that do not want Russia to communicate with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, and there is a legislative, executive and judicial power.
There, the National Petroleum Corporation, the National Bank and other State structures.
Of course, some countries have been interested in keeping us from going there.
And we mixed all the maps and started actively communicating with Tripoli and Tobrok.
We have already reaped the results of this work: Rosenifty has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the State oil company Libya-NOC.
The NOC Director, Mustafa Sanalla, whose head Rosenifti Igor Cechin concluded a deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, there was the first shipment of the Libyan oil company Rosnaft.
What will Russia do to her?
I suppose it's reselling.
And what are the economic interests of Russia in Libya?
In plans to re-sign contracts concluded at Muammara Qaddafi.
These include previous arrangements in the transport sector (road construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, as with Iran, is the oil-for-service scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal with these questions directly.
Actually, Russia's economy is not important in Libya.
We are in fact engaged in peacekeeping.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans agree between themselves so that they can establish order and that Libya ceases to be a favourable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main challenge of helping the Libyan people and destroying terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that to date there was no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone recordings of Islamic and radical groups (Libya).
And from what nations are those militants?
I don't want to go into these details.
Then we'll put the question in a different way.
How many Islamic militia fighters in Libya are the Libyans themselves?
There are virtually no Libyans among them, not more than 5%.
The rest are coming.
Can Moscow negotiate in the case of Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are engaged in active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have expressed their readiness to return to Moscow or the Grozny.
When can such talks be negotiated?
It's hard to say.
There are still several visits to take place, and I hope that we will be clear about the time and place of negotiations.
In the Czech museum, charities collected money for a expensive gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old son, Sasha Mazola, who has a CPD, a brain hydrocephalia and a full blindness, will be given a special runway on 5 August.
A useful presentation is made by the Minister of Culture of Moscow, Oksana Cosareva, and the director of the Museum of Constant Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charitable marathon, "Don't stand to do good," which was held in Melicha on July 15, on the Day of Remembrance of Chechov.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum, they received a letter from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manuchino in the area of Chekov, saying, "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked Mom to write that letter."
"I'd like to get a present on the runway to make my feet strong, and I'd learn to walk a little."
Sashina's dream has come true!
Following the entrance of the Conceert Postscrypt Museum, a famous pianist, a well-deserved Russian artist, Alexander Gindin performs poпурs from popular classical works.
During the charitable marathon in Melihov, the choir of the Visennes David Desert, called by the workshop of Ilya Drozdichin, students of the Moscow Conservatory P.I., Chaikovsky and Russian Academy of the name of Gnesiny, the artists of the Melikhov theatre of the Chechov Studio.
Auctions were conducted for visitors, a book fair and a charitable sale of souvenir products with a marathon logo.
The Milihovo Museum Reserver has taken the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Czech on 15 July a single day of charity in all the Museum of Submoskya.
A 30-year-old resident of the Zytomir region near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, his noise was ravaged, and he was reported to “FACTAM” in the Zhitomir Police Department.
Then the man entered a cafe nearby.
He had a conflict in the building in which a man used rubber bullets to shoot one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim has been provided with the necessary medical care and no threat to his life.
Police and rapid medical assistance have arrived at the scene, but the shooting has been escaping.
The law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain what he was doing.
He had a rubber bullet shooting device that was sent to an examination.
In this case, criminal proceedings were commenced under article 296 (Huliganity) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
Detention of three to seven years is at risk for the deprivation of liberty.
Remember, a shooting attack took place in Kiev, Lukiyanovka, in the area of the street of Tatarska on the night of 28 July.
Michel Carter's verdict for reports that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
The Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years ' imprisonment for using text messages and telephone calls to kill her boyfriend, Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in prison and another five years in the test period.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, which killed himself on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said at the hearings on Thursday, "My family is sad.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain at liberty before the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum of 20 years, but attorneys said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, handcuffed, and lowered her eyes.
"In her own actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor declared to the court.
"She has interrupted his life to improve her.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She has not shown repentance."
But attorney Carter said it was a "tragic case she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that, in his view, her “age, maturity or even mental illness did not have a significant impact on her actions”.
The Prosecutor read out the statements of Roy Linn Roy's mother, which says, "No day has passed when I would not cry for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and of how I deal with it -- I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever," he says.
Nurse Roy Kamdin Roy said she was incessantly struggling with the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become aunt of his children.
"Hallowing the man who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
This case would seem to be a legal precedent, since in Massachusetts there was no law that provided for responsibility for the advice of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The incident attracted the attention of the whole country when it became known that he was suicidally driven by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself with a knife without knowing a lot of ways," she wrote in a few reports sent two weeks before his death when he rested with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad," and "You have to switch on ignition, and you're going to be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through the death of Roy, and forbid her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few defenders of Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 for killing her British apartment neighbour in Italy and justified two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her special opinion in Los Angeles, saying, "Missel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Eugenius Bogochev, "I let Langford go like a high-fly bird."
A 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNITA.
The American Defender of Investia commented on President Unicus Eugenius Bogochev.
Keith made the decision on family circumstances, Eugenius Bogochev told me.
He has a little child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go see him.
Of course I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved another relationship.
He played three seasons in UnicSy and showed a high level in each match, with a total of 100 per cent.
So I let him go like a high-fly bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in family life and a play career.
Kit Langford played the Casan Club for three years, winning silver of the Single League 2015/16.
He was awarded the most effective player in the Eurolyga season in season 2016/17.
He took 21.75 points on the average for a match.
The result is the second since the establishment of the award in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolyga, who received the prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign the contract with the Chinese Shenchen, informing Eurohoops.
The American is expected to enter into a 2-year contract of $5 million.
Langford will be the second July Eurolyga star that goes to the Chinese championship.
Previously, Jannis Burusis moved to Chinese CBA, an ex-centre Panatenaicos.
A solar tourist from Submoskia was evacuated by a helicopter in Adigay
Today, Adigay rescuers evacuated a mosquito tourist from the mountainous region with the strongest sun burns.
The man rested at the Pisht shelter at a height of 1.6,000 metres.

Audi to be modified to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW stated that it would be proposed to update the software to over 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman stated that the company believed that “there were more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, noting European cities, including Munich, where the BMW is located, which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Dimler stated on Thursday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe would be modified to reduce their diesel exhaust.
None of the companies have called their step to retreat.
European autoproducers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide emission regulations.
However, nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of auto-producing equipment converting diesel gases has also increased, and it is difficult to maintain the competitive cost of cars.
While German autoproducers are under the close attention of the Chancellor Angels Mercel’s Government, they also accused him of being acquitted by influential autoproducers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies try not to repeat the Folkswagen errors that concealed the use of the so-called "disruptive devices" which, during testing, could correct the number of harmful gases emitted so as to conform to the rules and to turn off in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Folkswagen leaders were sentenced to trial, and the rest were being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, a former chief of thermodynamics department was arrested, consisting of an Audi engine development team.
Former manager, Zackeo Jovanni Pamio, Italian, and he's not protected from extradition and can be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi undertook a German criminal investigation involving Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation that had previously been concentrated on the United States.
Including “Audi” in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the producer of elite cars is a disproportionately high share of the Folkswagen income.
In Astrahani, the cafe visitor paid for false money
The police received a report from the bank ' s department of detection on the recalculation of money from the perpet point of the suspicious bill by a nominal of 5,000 roubles.
A study at the Expert Criminalist Centre revealed that it was false.
According to UMVD Russia in the Astrahan region, a visitor to a cafe purchased a bank note.
It is worth noting that the cashier was not equipped with the instrument to determine the authenticity of the buyers.
The police are currently establishing persons involved in the manufacture and marketing of a fake CBC ticket.
Such offences are punishable by imprisonment of up to 8 years, with a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs calls for attention to be given to financial transactions; traders are encouraged to establish instruments to verify the authenticity of money received.
The astronomers found an "Adian" planet on which even iron can melt.
In the first study of the properties of the giant exoplaneta stratosphere, WASP-121b, astrophysics were amazed at its temperature, which can evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts pointed out that the water molecules are so hot with the star’s light that infrared radiation is emitted.
Habble's telescope captured the glowing water molecules on this gas giant: it's high temperature that makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called hot jeopardies - gas giants, by size and mass, comparable to the largest planet of the Solar System, but ten times closer to the parent star.
As a result, only 1.3 "terrestrial" days are spent on the exoplanet and its gas shell is packed to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens the provande.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but it is now feared that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavunda has become worse because of dry weather and insect disease, which has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, says: “Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the fall of the rains have become much smaller.
This affects lavanda's lifetime.
And there are little zicades that jump on the leaves of insects that carry micro-bacteria; in the very dry weather, there is a lot of them."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very demanded in perfumeria and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "There are very long collars with a large number of large colors, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or no.
So we have fewer parts containing ether oil."
Decisions that are under consideration include improved distribution of water and deceleration of soil evaporation, as well as plant spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water and the production of drought-sustainable classes.
Ambassador of the Winter University 2019 met with red-school students
The two-fold champion of the world at Hokkeya, Ambassador of the Winter University 2019, Alexander Semin met on the eve of the start-up Hokkey, and distributed autographs to the hospitals.

In Gosdepe, the words of Medvedev were commented.
The official representative of the U.S. State Department, Heather Naurt, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister F. Dmitria Medvedev, said that it was necessary to find “publics for interaction” with Russia.
She said that such areas should be found to “enlarge bilateral interaction”.
Naurt described the Syrian Armistice Agreement as an example of such successful cooperation.
We're two super-Power nuclear.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," said the diplomat.
In doing so, Naurt refused to comment on Medvedev's claim for a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, of course, she has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this subject," said the representative of the Lord.
Previously, President Donald Trump of the United States signed a bill on strengthening sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on a new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the RF of Medvedev stated that Washington had declared a full trade war by putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also stated that the United States sanctions would take place for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister, the U.S. craftsman was “a clean game” of the Tempa.
The missing bodibilder was found on a stranger's gift to the lost memory.
Bodibilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on 25 July under very picantial circumstances, leaving the car to go to the toilet.
Seven days he was unsuccessfully searched by acquaintances and locals.
Shemel was on a foreign daughter in Ramen.
He was totally naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete couldn't explain how he was here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was gone.
Immediate identification has helped to make an announcement of his fall.
The doctors who arrived on the phone recorded a partial loss of memory and a trauma in Khanmet, reports Pablik Mash.
The athletes are probably waiting for other surprises.
The evildoers who kidnapped Shamil probably had already been in his apartment, the keys from which he had also been stolen.
July oil gas revenue exceeded 7.4 billion roubles
The actual oil gas revenues received since July 2017 exceeded 7.4 billion roubles, reports the Ministry of Finance.
The surplus, as explained by the department, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to a rouble compared with the average monthly value of June used for evaluation, as well as to the excess of the actual production of gas and the export of the projected levels of petroleum products.
“The leakage of the federal budget from the monthly valuation in accordance with the Federal Budget Act 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 by +40.2 billion roubles”.
Thus, the aggregate amount of funds for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of a foreign currency would amount to 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Minfin of Russia.
Every working day during this period, the TB will make purchases of a foreign currency at organized Mosk Exchange trades fairly during the business day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury in Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The weekly Riodose newspaper staff usually meet on the environment to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa, related to organized crime, corrupted officials or the ongoing war of drug dealers.
But today, with their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to a office in which they had already thrown a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name each column - evidence is not needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on hold by the Government or cartels, and a whole list of teenagers, which makes chaos coverage in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not provide recreation, and there are more and more journalists among the corpses that abound in the country: according to the Journalists ' Protection Committee, at least 25 since President Enrico Pen Nieto took his post in December 2012; 589 people, after attacks and threats, are under federal protection; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the most recent are their publisher and inspiring co-founder, Javier Valdez Kardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” wrote Waldes in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is very acute, although his presence is widespread - a large photograph of Waldes showing his middle finger, with the label “Justitude” hanging on the Fascade of the Riodosa Building; two reporters in 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing shirts that represent his smile, his face in his eye or his firm Panama.
The seminar is held less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, their sleeplessness, their paranoia.
Although the office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to investigate journalism cases, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee for the Defence of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders per year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists killers are rarely brought to justice.
Riodose journalists insist that they'll write about violence in Sinaloa, although they're killed with grief, although they're much more dangerous around now.
Without information about murderers, without justice from security talks at meetings, Ibarra says.
"Very stupid to waste time at this seminar," he says.
"As long as we don't know the reason, we suspect everyone."
In the morning of May 15, Waldes left Riodose's office in the capital of the state of Kuliakan.
He was able to travel only a couple of blocks before his red Toyote Corollo was stopped by two men; he was taken out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the title of the newspaper, which means the Twelfth River.
The shooter left his car and crashed her nearby.
Waldesa was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
Hearings usually go quickly across Kuliacan.
But Waldes is almost silent about everything.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States last January, Sinaloa has become one of the most bloody battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vakuum.
Let us not say that every day on the streets of Sinaloa, one or more people are killed, or that the cemetery is filled with two-story monkeys, more than many living people's homes.
Forget for a moment that the state of tranquillity is just when one of the cartels takes control of the naval state with important ports and the paths of the drug traffic in the United States.
Despite this and that Waldes knew very well the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, 60-year-old cofounder and director Riodose, was crushed by the guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks that two mistakes helped to kill him.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopes, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel that fights with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could have irritated the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were brought to the Kiosky.
The second error was that he did not force Waldes to leave the country for his own security after another newspaper that had been captured, which had written about the same story.
Waldes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his assassination was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He's been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be there.
He was an experienced reporter in "Noroyst", and in 2003, with five colleagues, he founded Riodosa, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, “there was no room for journalism without affecting the subject of drugs,” said Bohorques.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publication, sales and advertising.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, but readers were attracted to reading about things that no one else dared to write.
Eight years after its foundation, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Murse Cabo Prize for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Waldes won the International Press Freedom Prize for the courage to investigate the Mexican drug trade, wherever it may lead.
He frankly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is "the way of life," he said last October in an interview by Rompeiento TV.
"You have to accept the tasks that you have on you as a journalist, either that, or you're just ridiculing a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodose's staff miss Waldes, a joker who chattered like a port loader, a friend who was generous for arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to sit alive.
They relied on his order.
He always had to wear his hat.
He had to go to the Guayabo El, bar in front of the office, and always sit there behind the same table.
Now they ask him, "Did he be destroyed by the love of the unified order?"
His death also caused them to doubt their calculations of how best to do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like you know their wives, their children, their legal business, and their clandestine drugs airfields.
"These things were behind the line," said Bohorquez.
The result, even in the best times, was a high level of self-assessment and self-sustainment.
We have to believe our instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodose, Andres Villareal, is that "the hook can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier."
Old rules, says he and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa - like Tamaulipas, Verakrus, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of profitable smuggling routes, weak public institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is changing all the time.
In a room where Riodose staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly prohibited to introduce cellular phones: a few days earlier it was known that spying programmes, which were sold exclusively to Governments, were used in Mexico to track journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shadows of a tree of 104 degrees of heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were commissioned by the State Government to protect Riodose's office, which is located in the four-story building in the Bourgeois district of Kuliacan.
Some journalists who heard asked whether these police officers included the 50 per cent of the order servants about whom the Governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area under the de facto control of drug gangs.
The nearest issue of Riodosa had three main themes.
It's the murder of the brother of the former champion in Sinalo's box for Julio Cezar Chavez.
They also had the detection of government expenditures concentrated in the home city of the Governor.
And there was a group kidnapping of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, blocked by the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so we had to be careful when the time had come to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time for drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant had been registered in the name of the policy of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had dominated at all levels of government over almost the entire century.
Recently, there have been strong allegations of corruption against several governors from PRI.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including the fact that the son of El Chapo, Guzman, had slipped off the raids of the military.
A few months ago, readers would have sought Waldes' column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
"Long we'd already know what happened," says 46-year-old William, for his artistic corpse, called El Flacco.
"Today, all the channels of communication with our sources are dissolved."
The Valdes Cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and steekers protesting against the killings of journalists, because staff have become who they never thought they were: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and sent the following morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office devoted to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoacán State in the west of the country three days after Waldes was killed.
Found a burned body, and the authorities said it was on the basis of DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak louder, to organize protests and to write “SOS Press” on the pavements and walls of the houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to obtain international support for the Valdez justice requirement.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the following day after the murder of Waldes Ramirez, the authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
She then asked not to give her any further publicity work, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Waldes said many times that journalists in Mexico were “circumcised” by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent societies.
In his last book Narco-Journalistica, he wrote that reporters are not just killing drug gangs; they do so by orders from politicians and security services in conspiracy with organized crime.
The Press Protection Committee, Articulo 19, considers that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out by order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you down," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings are intimidating people.
Everyone remembers the death of Mary's blogger Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, they found a note, allegedly written from the face of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and the earphones lay next to her cut head.
Some publications preferred to close up as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after her correspondent, Miroslav Bridge, was killed in March.
Others continue to hold as El Manyana from Nouevo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed drug cartels with the help of an editorial on page 1, "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their home states or even a country.
It's a painful solution.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to look at the dangers in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as obviously happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015, together with four women in Mexico's apartment three months after the escape from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance each day between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits he's scared to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico falls into hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, Riodosa publishers were sitting on the pavement next to the office and drinking beer when suddenly their phones called at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near Masatlan's resort city, confirmed, left 19 bodies behind.
The war continued to ignite, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the pavement, they put the news on the Riodosa website through their mobile phone.
The first page was to be reworked the next day.
There's another round in the neighborhood.
Bohorquez saw whether the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under the immense portrait of the dead founder of their newspaper, whose average finger was put to the sight of all Sinaloa, Ryodose's staff continued his case.
"How can you think of closing the door," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the practicer asked me to send her to the street to report?"
The dinosaur used the camouflage to avoid enemies.
At first glance, he seems to be a statue, even though he's terrifying.
The researchers reported that the first incredible remains of incredibly sized rhinos, found by a Canadian miner, remained so well that the experts called it “Mona Lisa among the Dinosaurs”.
It's so well preserved that they could even figure out that the color of his rusty skin was red and brown - and say he had some kind of a dark past.
A report published in Modern Biology describes it as “the most well - preserved from Tireopor in the history of discoveries and one of the best copies of dinosaur in the world”.
This is a newly discovered copy of a nodosaurus living in the middle of a small period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition was shocking to researchers who call it “very great”.
This herbal tyreophorus is the most well - preserved fossil in the history of discoveries, according to the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank when he was working in the Millenium Mine of the Sancore Company near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He encountered something that seemed to be different from the natural rock and decided to look more carefully.
The mineral was sent to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work has been done to detect an animal inside the earth’s wax of 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final result can be demonstrated.
“It's only a little bit of a stink, and it can almost be believed that he's sleeping,” said the lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-saved copies of dinosaurs — Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
In studying his skin, researchers found that it was vegetative, even though it was covered with a pancreas and was like a walking tank, likely to be at great risk from the tropical dinosaurs.
This powerful pancreased dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from the predators and used protective techniques, known as a protective color, also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow him to blend up quickly with the environment and avoid contact with the enemies, experts say, presuming that he was being hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This creature, 110 million years old, belonging to the family of nodosaurus, was widely illuminated in the May press and is now exhibited in the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrelles.
Scientists have already studied the animal and have given him the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the Museum Laborant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, who spent over 7,000 hours after his scratching.
The surprising preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and the international group of scientists to document the picture and form of the scams and plastic plates on his body.
They discovered a protective color, a widely distributed method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the bulk of the substance was darker than its bottom.
Although protective colors are well distributed, the discovery has become surprising because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is considerably higher than the size of the live animals with a protective color.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by the fleshy dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the modern - day shielded animals, such as reindeer, zebras, or armor - bearers, are much smaller and more accessible mining, which shows that the nodosaurus had to struggle seriously for survival.
“The serious threat posed by the predators to the massive, powerful dinosaur pancreas shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Melov period were,” said Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur cechus also indicates that his skin was to be red root.
Scientists continue to study an animal, looking for information about his life, including the remaining contents of his food tract, to find out what he was eating during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken down into the sea where he sinked and his back was lunged down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time Albert was as warm as it was now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans probably spread farther deeper than now.
“This nodosaur is truly noticeable because it is fully covered by the remaining silk skin, while it is fully preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original shape of the animal,” said Brown.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it was at that time, in the Early Fleet Period.
There is no need for imagination to be reconstructed, it is only a little bit of giggling, and it is practically possible to believe that he is sleeping."
The Melae period is an age when giant terroposes, fleshy dinosaurs standing on two legs, wandered around the earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaur of the river, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tyreopher could hunt a ancestry of his fierce ancestors.
These include acrocantosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11.5 m) weighing six tons.
Scientists whose recent discoveries appear in the magazine Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after death and mummified in the fore.
The existence was found by Sean Fank when he was working in the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum officials, this is the world's most well-sustained tyreophorus, together with the skin and the pancreas, and it was entire, from face to thigh bones.
On average, they reached about 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
They were characteristic of two twenty-two hulls from their shoulders.
The researchers believe that this grass - tyreophorus tyreophorus has been hard to walk on what is now Canada until the varied river has dragged it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his pancreas to the smallest parts.
The fossil remains of this particular copy have been preserved so well that the leather remains are still covered by buggling pants along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Grészko wrote in the National Geographic magazine article, a degree of security “are rarely as a lottery winner. ”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossils of the skin still cover bangry pants that inspire the animal’s skull.
His right front leg is stretched out along the side, five fingers on it turned up.
I can count the scaffolds on his pilgrimage."
Mikhail Saakashvili succeeded in entering Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, formerly head of Georgia and then Odessa district in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without having documents to confirm his identity and nationality.
Saakashvili's arrival reports a Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video on its channel on YouTube with his presentation.
Saakashvili addressed the anniversary of the Warsaw rebellion against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the Politician did not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician referred to Georgia ' s cooperation with Poland, as well as to Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service deprived the Ukrainian citizenship of the country, the opal politician learned while in the United States.
How he was able to make a transatlantic flight without documents as yet unknown.
Previously, former Governor of the Odessa Province, Michael Saakashvili, stated that his signature on the questionnaire for the acquisition of Ukrainian nationality had been counterfeited.
The politician stressed that he didn't fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation of the Wynesicher and Olkhovik case was extended until January
A preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova group Eugenia Olhovik and the Head of Energy Cholding Boris Weinzicher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court deals with the extension of domestic arrest by the accused.
The representative of the UK at the meeting reported on the last decision to extend the pre-trial investigation.
“Specific complexity and lengthy investigations are due to the need to remove and conduct examinations of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigations on the territory of several RC entities,” said the investigator.
He added that suspects were regularly bribed by the leadership of the Coma.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Weinzicher, Olhovik, as well as the former ZAO leader of the Complex Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobod, who was headed by the Employer company by 5 September, handed over bribes to the highest officials of the Republic of the Comi bribes for the establishment of the maximum benefits of thermal and electrical tariffs, as well as for the creation of an enabling business environment.
Winsicher and Olhavovik were detained, phased into Sictivcar and arrested for two months, and Slobодин escaped the investigation and was released to a federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose Streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked.
Only one day after the arrival of New York, as part of a tourist visit, Saint Luis sat on beds in an airbnb apartment, looking for a fairboard tape on the phone.
She's pushed into a high school post.
It said, “The police just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he's still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noting that none of her tapes had spilled this information, puzzled it, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
There were lots of passes on her tape with a user with a nick @TheePharoah.
Repertoire Repertoire of the Great St. Louis reported on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a picture of the lifeless body of Brown, spread out in the street where it would be four hours.
"This is wildness," thought Ferrell.
But death was not something new to her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening she went back to the Tweets about the people going to Kenfield Drive.
There were photographs of a signal tape and screaming people and a man who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who held the poster, saying: “The Ferguson policeman has just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched the direct broadcast, as the police officer stands in front of a group of protesters with a blasphemy dog.
On another video, the other policeman, she said, took a rifle and screamed, "I'll kill you all... the animals!"
“It's an unusual situation,” Ferrell said, by her own memories.
"It's not like murder that we're used to and can be called typical.
At that moment, I felt chilled.
I was angry and crying."
She took the return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next nearly three years was the subject of a new documentary film entitled “Whose Streets? ” which will appear on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and endurance in terms of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
As Farrel went to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in flowers and crowns under the color, they remembered a conversation that had led countless times before this morning, “in the experience of black people and their situation”.
She recalls, as she said, “Do you remember how I told you about the struggle of black people for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the policeman killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
"I couldn't help taking it," said Ferrell later.
“What's happening today is the culmination of... what happened earlier.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be raised at it.
It must not only be well understood in activism and organization but also understand the different levels of black people's experience and their situation and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she is not personally confronted with obvious racism, she is not different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have given her a bad favor if I were to protect her from it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop was on South Florissant Road, on the roadway from a police station that had become like a tent camp while the activists were awaiting reports of the final innocence of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined the local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packets.
They collected packets and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
Ferrell had a form of a new type of activism in his mind for a little bit.
“My activism has changed completely after 9 August,” she said, noting that as a student of the University of Missuri Saint Luis, she was the President of the Association of Sanitarian Students, representatives of national minorities, and was engaged in food justice and health disparities among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
It came on its own.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaa Folian, one of her fellow directors.
Fallian said that she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrere were “simply trying to document” events.
Ferrell came to the mind of the question, "Do you want to document, or you're trying to find a story where you can play? "
This skepticism was nailed by many people, often whites, who came to the community to benefit from its pain and steadfastness.
As Fallian recently explained, “We heard that the voices of the people who were born and grown up in Ferguson were not central, and we wanted to do so otherwise.”
Foljan had already joined with her co-sponsor Damon Davis, a local artist known for its activism on the death penalty.
His participation sparked sympathy for the Ferrell project and for the six other local residents with whom the “Whose Streets?” project team had been liaising over the years following the assassination of Brown.
“In this documentary film, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak,” said Davis.
“It was the most important thing for me to see these people, because this is how I will be represented.”
Although the aim of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell, it was to show that the movement was “not about a rescue leader, but about how the community was united”, as Folian said, it was the most open of the participants in the film.
As a result, the “Whose Streets?” reveals unexpectedly the personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked, ” said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the product.
“But I realized that when you do such work and man-made blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's history again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Life Movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after the murder of a black-adolescent Travon Martin in 2012 -- are treated as homosexuals.
"The black homosexual women in the leadership positions support all of this movement," says Ferrell. "And everything is because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
"The black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Foljan accepted this assertion, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a multitude of homosexual black women”.
Nevertheless, she insists that “this is not a case of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not selected as the central character because of its distinctive characteristics.
"She was the man who sparked this energy," she said.
“ On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that it was first, because when ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, there have been no movie cameras in Ferguson, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be two and a half years in the test term for the shutdown of the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place that the home calls simply “Bardak”.
She still holds out for the stuff she learned when she came out on Ferguson's streets three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains."
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for the U.S. player's bite
El Salvador's Footballists, Henry Romero and Darwin Seren, have received long disqualifications for unsubstantiated conduct.
During the quadruple of the Golden Cup of North and Central America ' s Confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAAF) Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was Henry Romero's defender.
El Salvadorans bit Josie Altidor's attacker, after which he pinched him for his chest.
Then semi-defense Seren, when putting an angle in his punitive area, bite the U.S. defender Omar González.
As a result, Romero was disqualified by three matches and Seren by six.
The meeting itself ended with the American win at 2:0, Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning DNA
At the center of the Hall in Galeré Friedman in New York, people's faces are hanging from the ceiling on the wire -- white, black and brown, all of which are uncomfortable.
These 30 portraits were created by Heather Diwie-Harborg, an artist from the cheek and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent circumcisions from Fort Levenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving 35 years for a famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, on August 2, is called the Reconciliation of Similarity.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewi-Harborg, whose arts unite technology, information and art, and Manning, a transsexual woman and a famous dissident woman whom Barak Obama softened the sentence only three days before the end of his presidency.
After analyzing through a DNA computer program derived from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of persons who could have been with such a genome, Duy-Harborg created a deep, though difficult, manifestation of not only plasticity of DNA data -- different ways of interpreting them and inherent determinism of these interpretations -- but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name of Bradley Edward, said openly from the teenage age that he considered himself a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Spying Act, computer fraud and stealing.
Her photographs in prison were not available, so only one photograph was known to her: a grainy black and white selphie where Manning was in a Platinum in a Paris, apparently embarrassing, sitting behind the car, and associating her with that photograph.
In 2015, Dewey Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project, “The Visions of Aliens”.
In it, an artist created portraits of unknown people by means of a court evidence of the type of cotton and chewing rubber, extracting DNA from this debris and creating images of how these people might look.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They took an interview at Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dewi-Hagborg on the preliminary presentation of the new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became correspondence friends and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a book of Comics “Suffered Images” illustrated by Shoili Kango, which illustrated how the president would soften the punishment of Chelsea and could visit the exhibition personally in the future.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is opening right now, when Donald Trump declares war to people who reveal secret information in the Government, and finds new ways to incite the strife he is about to soften in Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked to coincide with this all the time, she said, "nothing happens accidentally."
In an announcement by an artist written on the gallery wall, the immense signature of Manning at the bottom (with a heart in place of a point on "i" in her name) calls for the end of the “automatic division on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the other side is its mitochondrial DNA, the long caterpillars of the pencil C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as scientifically articulated artist), Dewey Harborg was hoping to show how we are all incredibly similar, in any case in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Duy-Harborg; her 2007 videowork "False Remembrance" is also displayed here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the aforementioned novel in comic books.
It's got Manning in King Cong's style over the U.S. Correction Bars building with a loudspeaker in your hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it is written there.
"That's why don't you say that."
"It's a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says the artist who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning hasn't seen a exhibit in person yet -- like it was foreseen in comic books -- but when she comes, she'll be greeted by masks in the middle of the room, her own genomic simulators, assembled like crowds of protesters.
It's also deliberately done, as all at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning growth), where the pencil was painted by genetic haploso groups.
"Long I'd put them on the walls, but now I'd like them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey Harborg says about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like a movement that was standing for her release."
A professor of the North-West University and a staff member at Oxford University is searching for a murder charge
According to the police, there is a national raid at Professor North-West University and at Oxford University, who are found suspected of being found dead in a luxury number in Chicago.
According to the Cook District Court's records, on Monday, warrants for premeditated murder were issued without the right to release under the bail of 40-year-old Windham Latham and 50-year-old Andrew Warren on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton, James Cornel-Juranlo.
According to the documents, 20-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after multiple wounds were wounded.
In a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
The police received a call, and they arrived at the Grand Plaza complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornelle-Duranlo was declared dead at the crime scene, and the detectives are now investigating death from knives wounds, considering her murder, while the police are intensely searching for two suspects.
Latem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, Vice-President of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on administrative leave and that he was prohibited from entering the North-West University.
“This criminal case is currently being investigated by the Commissioners and the Northwest University is cooperating with the investigation,” said Kabbaj.
Warren works as a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
The representative of University and Deathville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We communicated with the British police and were prepared to provide any necessary assistance to the United States investigative bodies”.
The statement also stated that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
The Chief of Police Liaison, Chicago Anthony Gullelmi, said that it was very advisable for suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions of their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensified,” said Google.
According to Gullelmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gullelmi, the policeman was called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious report that something had happened in number 108.
The police called the crime scene awful.
Gullelmi reported that it was unclear whether the incident itself had occurred on 27 July.
According to his report, data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim have been linked,” said Google.
The Grand Plaza authorities issued a request to the lodgers, which reported: “The police are currently working on the time of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of reasons, including a possible domestic accident”.
Russian vice-premier Mutoko: “We will meet the requirements of the ADA road map soon”
The Russian Vice-Primeur Vitaly Mutoko said that the terms of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would be implemented shortly.
“The specified stage in the implementation of the requirements has been completed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (Untidoping Agency of Great Britain).
The VADA road map was updated accordingly”, said Mutko on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the VADA road map on the restoration of the Code of Conformity, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mootko, it does not contain anything that could be difficult for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian Andidoping Structures must publicly recognize the results of the investigation by WADA of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, who claimed that the doping in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
Referring to this question, Mutko said, "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there wasn't any Hospital Programs, and we're not going to admit what wasn't there."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnova, Head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
The same morning, in an interview with the Russian edition “Rsport” Smirnov, acknowledged the problems previously encountered in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains some controversial positions and provisions.
No one's going to accept this report unconditionally," he added Smirna.
WADA has removed RUSADA from pre-pingoing control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office of the organization in July, the Director-General of WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to rebuild its work.
The 79th-story tower in Dubai is extinguished.
The great fire that took place in one of the highest living buildings in the world, the tower of the Torch, is extinguished, transmits Reuters.
It is noted that firemen have been able to deal with all burning fires by 4.00 local time (3,00 ms).
The local authorities reported that no one had been injured as a result of the incident.
During the fires, streets adjacent to the sky scrap were closed.
The reasons for this are not yet known.
It has been reported earlier that Dubai has a 79-story skyscraper in the Torch, one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the inhabitants were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable bouzov's charms: trousers that don't cover the cowards
Olga Bouzov, a scandalal leader of the Dom-2 show, struck the spectators of the Europa Plus Live festival with rabbit dances.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the new duet singer with Nasty Kudri performed the song, "We'll be hot."
Both girls went out on the stage in provocative buckets, sewed in such a way that the lower singer was seen.
Buzova and Kudry were labeled on the trousers.
Previously, a specialist in a Moscow clinic for plastic surgery commented on the changes in the appearance of Bouzov.
Stoltenberg recognized the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, by the Radio 4 news service, with reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview by the CNN NATO genes, he also criticized Russia for the situation with Krym and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine”.
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that the dialogue with Russia was still possible and that the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Previously on Thursday, President Donald Trump stated that the U.S.-Russia relationship was at a dangerous low level, and accused the American Congress.
The Metro of Ekatherinburg is introducing a new way of paying
In October, travel at the Ekaterinburg Metro could be paid with a bank card, stated by Paul Vedernikov in an interview with the Public Gazette.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 world soccer championship the same system for travel in subway as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Lower Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want other people, mundial guests, to use the Metro by using their bank cards without taking their belts or standing in line," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become the next "Uber"
Amy Erett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, incorrect.
Even though she promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust the process.
“He has never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, headed by a 75-measured Madison Reed company in San Francisco, for e-trafficking in hair care.
She therefore turned to others for help.
There is now a new type of staff startups that help companies to find out how they feel about their staff.
By designing and licensing the software assigned to measure staff involvement, they allow companies to make expressive surveys, to refer to certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases to allow the informers to pass down top managers and to refer directly to the Directive.
“Now we have instruments such as Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?”
Herrett explained that she had gained a better understanding of what she thought and felt by her staff in three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the espress-questions and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a warm map of the company and demonstrates in an illustrative manner which has more complaints and whose approval managers have a low level, allowing them to understand why.
Companies are slightly aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another Uber, who was involved in a scandal when a former staff member published a post on a blog that described the aggressive situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The Internet portal, “Let's talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compliance industry by 2020, could cost more than $118.7 billion.
The Convercent startup from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, against the fall of Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send individual staff opinion polls, to collect real-time confidential responses and to review the heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages, which allows staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go straight to the Directive.
“The public opinion court overtook the power of the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If the company finds itself ill-treated or ineffectual, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face the costly consequences of the beatings of clients, the outflow of staff and the judicial proceedings, reported to Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with over 25,000 staff in 500 establishments, used Convercent for more than a year to make sure that staff were aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company ' s head office.
Earlier, if a staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to search for a telephone number or a head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be seriously rejected.
Often this was a frightening and frustrating experience, reported by James Vitrano, the director of the legal office of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, the problems previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states — such as discrimination, charity and unjust pay — can be found and handled quickly.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation,” said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from trial with the staff”.
According to Quinland, companies began to take more seriously the ethics, values and involvement of employees in 2002, after the accounting firm Artur Andersen collapsed as a result of ethical infringements as a result of Dela Enron.
But only when “social networks were spread,” companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty laundry from spreading viruses on the network.
“Before the use of technologies to control ethics, people have used hope as a strategy,” he said.
And Glint, and Convercent offer their software as a service, raising regular fees from companies for using their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to receive the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the total capital of the company to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, resulting in a total capital of $60 million.
These investments are unlikely to be surprising, given the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of studies show that today ' s employees expect more of their jobs than before.
In hard-competitive markets such as the Sylicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the minimum necessary.
Staff members want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to companies with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in companies, they feel that they are heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQuin, Vice-President on global benefits and the satisfaction of staff members in Linkedin, where they are used and “Convercent” and “Glint”.
Investors get revenues when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses go well when staff are dedicated and involved.
If the third party ' s analytical tools promise to increase the commitment and engagement of staff, it is not surprising that they find support.
According to cultural experts in the workplace, it is important to have data on staff involvement.
But the data are useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if the company asks for feedback, it may give the impression that changes will come.
And if change does not come fast enough or not at all, disappointment can develop, and staff will lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be ready to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rath, president of the consulting firm Kotter International, who had to see companies make a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the officers will wonder, ‘ Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care?"
According to Erett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly staff interviews, is in a position to take action on the same day as anyone reports the problem with Glint.
And after collecting feedback from staff who were dissatisfied with decision-making and communication quality, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning new knowledge of its staff and hopes that, in the long term, this knowledge will help it to hold staff more effectively in the industry known for the high turnover of staff.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose company.
In Barnaul, the new asphalt is discovered at the Red-Armenian avenue.
In Barnaul, major measures have been taken to address the causes of the asphalt failures in the Red-Armayean avenue.
The place where the holes had twice arisen on the recently embedded carriageway (the crossing of the Youth Street) has been resolved to open.
Remember, the destruction of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the land in the area of the unmanned network.
According to the Vice-Chairperson of the Urban Road, Maintenance, Transport and Communications Committee, Ivan Harmath will conduct a detailed survey for the purpose of examining and eliminating the preconditions for the damage.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is envisaged that it will be necessary to rebuild and concrete the burrow of unsuccessful communications.
This is reported on the official site of the province of the capital.
Comandé Brunes has to do longer because the National Students ' Sport Association cancelled training twice a day
Time is approaching at 11 p.m.; a crowd of soccerists from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed to speak on one side of the new training fields of the team located in the Campus.
Some of them pulled their t-shirts, wearing their backs, brilliant with sweat after the tough first day of the sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
Summer players will, after three hours of training, go back to the classroom to prepare for final examinations and return the next morning to Basserman's soccer center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday became Tuesday, Bruinz Jim Mora, the coach of the team, said, “The next three days these guys are waiting for meat cuts.”
The fact that the National Student Sport Association canceled the exercise twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload for players, actually extended their work day — at least before the Friday examinations were completed.
So the start of the first three trainings of the California University team in Los Angeles was appointed at 7:15 p.m. to get them into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two training sessions per day has increased the number of days with one training, and Bruinz is moving the beginning of the camp for almost a week, compared to the previous year, and conducts training during summer school for the first time in the six Mora seasons in Vestuda.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training until 20 August before formal preparations for the first game in the season against team A&M at Texas University in September.
Mora said that he supported a change in the rules of the National Student Sport Association, despite the fact that he had created another point in the dense schedule of players.
"In three or four days we're giving them this enormous burden, this is a serious test," said Mora.
"And they just got through it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make training closed; it is a challenge, as its fields are in direct visibility from the adjacent parking parking parking and from the nearby Laskin Center, a dear hotel that had already been bombarded with footballs that had crossed the protective network behind the gate.
The Bruinz players should take the hotel from these weekends, but Mora assumes that a problem may arise when rooms are free during the season.
“We will have security,” said Mora.
"It's a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger, presuming that someone can take the room, sit there and record the training on the video.
If you have a video recording, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in the parking lot number 8.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
All victims of the terrorist attack in Petersburg are discharged from hospitals
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg subway in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice Governor Anna Mitanina.
According to the data at the end of July, three people remained in stationars, transmitting the TB Centre.
Remember, the explosion at St. Petersburg subway was heated on 3 April this year.
The suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov was blown up.
As a result, 15 people were killed, as well as the executioner himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abraor Azimov, were arrested.
Remember, on the previous day, Rossmodeward recommended that the Metropolitan of Petersburg reconsider the road safety plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors frameworks.
Facebook reinforces fact cheating in the fight against fairy news.
Facebook will more often send suspicious texts to mystifications, independent experts, and show them under original positions, stated on Thursday the largest social network of the world that is trying to fight so-called freak news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for verification and possibly show the results of a cheating fact under the reference post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called foe news, which many believed had an impact on the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also actively debated in Europe after French voters have been misleaded by false messages before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany, prior to the September elections, have expressed support for a plan to fine social networks if they do not expeditiously remove posts that incite hatred.
On Thursday, in a separate German statement, Facebook reported testing of a new cheating algorithm launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands, and Germany.
"Only to see what reports are contested by independent verifiators, people want to have a broader context in order to make reasonable judgements about what they read and what they share," wrote Sarah Sue in her cluster, a Facebook feed manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "connected articles" and work on other changes in the news feed to solve the problem of freight news.
New novel comicx: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the small castle of Scotney was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 1980s served as a shelter for Margaret Tetcher.
But for 700 years from his comfortable place in the Beul Valley in Kent County, he watched a turbulent story around him, and now inspired Jamie Rods, Yorkshirez, with a spinal hair, with a tendency to have historical documents, to a novel comicx.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at a man who died 300 years ago," he said with excitement.
"You feel that way in person when you hold that letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian Era and tells of the families who lived in Scotney; each story illustrated one of the young British artists, Ayzek Lankevich, Briony May Smith, William Excli, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote "The Dead Man and Other Histories" -- a collection of papers from the British Library; this project suddenly touched him to the bottom.
"I could've pulled a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on an asabote," he says.
"It's a fingerprint."
And letters always smell smoke, because in those times fires were lit.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man who is so passionate for old papers, to receive support from the National Fund and the English Art Research Council and to live in a castle for four months (“In frankly, I had a little bit of food there”) it seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the Victorian Castle, walking through the archives, and looking at many treasures of property and old things, such as the head of guinea on walls or bottles that had been in the verge for centuries.
He walked through the park and at the ruins of the old castle, talked to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations to his book.
Then, at night, he "walked his whiskey and sat down to write."
The story of Scotney's castle is not very thorough because the National Fund had full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassi, died.
When Rods arrived ten years later, the officers were only beginning to deal with the archive he described as “that the Aristocracies had been thrown into the lounge for centuries.”
Days, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what you think the land disputes are boring, says Rods, but here's the beaches of two families.
There's been a lot of things, guys!"
In some stories the castle compendium becomes the starting point for wider discoveries in English history: for example, in Robotnik, the hero leaves the newly constructed castle to join the 1381 Crestian Revolution.
“There is information about the rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called Kenta and Sassex's Rysk families,” says Rods.
"The Kristian uprising began in these places, and I thought that rebellion was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other stories are closely related to the castle story, for example, the priest, which describes the Jesuit priest whose family of Darrelov has been hiding at her home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or the Contrabandist, of 18th - century Smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is supposed to have injected his own funerals, stoned the grave (which was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug).
Darrela's favorite Rhodes family of all the people who lived in Scotney, "The Jentlemen seem to be a perfect jewel, they've been in debt forever, and they're spending money on things that they couldn't afford.
In many generations, the Darrela men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women -- I imagine them as a company of nice guys who can look after the heirs of big wealth."
Following the completion of the Rods Castle work, there are other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish slum, where he wrote a graphic novel about the Elamianmakes, where the sanatorium was in the early 20th century, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
"I felt like this: Damn it, I have to go back to real life."
Fifteen largest banks are chosen by "Rossia"
Conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARBs) is developing: following Sberbank, TB, WTB-24, Alpha-bank, Gasprombank, Rosselhozbank, Binbank and Opening, seven other credit organizations are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, ARB organizations will have at least 80 per cent of the market.
But this is not merely an exit -- all banks that have declared a break from ARB are negotiating with another public organization that brings together credit institutions -- the Association of Regional Banks, Russia, headed by a well-known politician, Anatolia Aksakov, the Chairman of the Committee of the Financial Market, recognized, by the end of the last session, and the most effective leader of the Duma Committee and the deputy on the number of drafted bills.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was initiated during the discussion of the Council of the Federation when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, such as new bank classifications depending on the size of statutory capital.
At that time, Garégin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, stated that, in the view of the association, the Bill was adopted in the interest of the largest banks, which were thus trying to limit the capacity of small and medium banks in the regions to intercept their clients.
Among other claims was the criticism of Centrobank, which, in the opinion of Tosunyan, did not always justify the revocation of licences from some banks, which was true to have been objected by the representative of the CBC: many of the leaders of the transcripted banks, in particular the Wingprombanka, had been included in the governing bodies of the ARB.
This exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive relationship with the principal banking regulator is likely to be an obvious reason for the fifteen largest banks to start, in dissent with the ARB policy, preparing for the accession of the Association “Russia”, noting that “the efficiency of the ARB work will be low and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted”.
It'll be better for the investors.
What's the end?
Answer immediately the key question that arises in or near a banking situation, and the investors are not at risk, rather, the reliability of the banking system will improve.
It is headed by the Axakov Anatoli Aksakov, known for its sensitivity in all the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all BC leadership is present at annual association events, and all relevant regulatory legislative initiatives are carried out through the regional expert evaluations.
The staff-organization plan is also obviously not foreseen by special shocks.
The ARB is undoubtedly in a difficult financial and management situation after the loss of such powerful and influential participants, with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, in this oldest, established in 1991, a banking community organization, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment as a whole.
It cannot be said that, in the Russian Association, with protracted arms, they are ready to accept, on any condition, on the basis of the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Aksawov (“may wish too much”), who, on 21 July at a press briefing in the Parliamentary newspaper, stated that “the next day, the representatives of the banks departing from the ARB had asked me to consider the possibility of building the capacity of our association “Rossia”.
Their proposals are to increase the voice of bankers in the Council of Association and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is under way, the proposals of both parties are being examined, and the extraordinary assembly of an association is being prepared to be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we can figure out.
Anatoly Aksakov also, stressing that “the chair is not holding”, called the possible new leader of the renewed Association “Rossia”, Georgia Luntsky, who leaves the post of Vice-President of Centralobank in September, with a high description of his business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatol Aksakov, who is now resting in Kruma, is planning to suspend the leave and to arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Association “Rossia” to consider the item on the extraordinary assembly of the “Rossia”.
The entry of cars with petrol engine to major Russian cities will not be limited
The Deputy Head of Mintrans Nicolas Asaul stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with petrol engines into major Russian cities will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our notion is that the ecological class needs to be gradually enhanced.
And there's the concept of going into zero emissions right there.
I don't think we're technically ready to do that.
The question is, since what year?
That's the same thing at the slogan level, let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe that's gonna happen," quotes Prim's words to the Minister.
Earlier, the newspaper “Isvestia” reported that by 17 August, the Vice-President of Arcade Dwarković had been instructed to examine proposals for possible options for electrical transport holders submitted to the Government by the PAO Director of the KAMAZ, Sergei Cogogini.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, are the use of cars from the AVS in major cities and in resorts.
Washington's changing the rules for getting grincards.
According to the media, President Donald Trump stated that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted, which would change the Grencharta rules.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary working visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and are supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and will do so with a change in how the U.S. issuing grincards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new process of making statements will provide advantages for the candidates who own English, have the financial resources that enable them to maintain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” said the Trump, according to the American media.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should bother us.
Before we thought 2017 could be worse, a new report on technological successes in sex production was issued.
Yeah.
The sex robots are at the centre of attention.
The Worker ' s Fund (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkie, a well-deserved professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffild and FRR cofounder, we must take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eye of robots, the shape of the horns, and the type of nails.
"People are giggling about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in a large number, and soon we'll see them much more," said Sharkie at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex goops evolved from their industrious assemblies to robots with silicon skins, warm to patches, and with almost human recipes that govern the artificial intelligence.
Users can also "construct" their robots according to their own taste by selecting everything from the color of the eye and shape of the robot pitches to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "person" compared to which Stepford Wife would be very progressive is more concerned.
Modern sex goops have become robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to adjust the quality that they find attractive, for example, of shyness.
There are other sex robots of Roxxxy Gold developed by "True Companion", which are presented with an already programmed individual -- for example, "Holly Farra" makes the impression shy, and Dika Wendy has a "smart" character.
"The Roxxxy Gold has a character that's beautifully suited to yours," it's enthusiastic to report "True Companion."
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so forth.
She's got a change of mood during the day like the real man!
She may want to sleep or chat or she can be "in the mood"!"
In the emergence of sex robots, there is a lot of concern -- not least because they replace real human relationships -- but is most concerned about the subordinate image of a woman, associations with rape that are causing the possession of the cold one (read: resistant) Fara.
On "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to a vibrant only for men.
"If a woman has a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex games.
Their emergence and the growing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subjection as an optimal addition.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the margins of the consumer culture.
But what comes from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It's not a coincidence -- that these complex sex robots have emerged exactly when women's rights are threatened around the world when there is a president in the White House who boasts about what comes to women.
The feariest part of the TV series is not graphic images, twisted bodies and grinded eyes, that's how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem so big.
The aim of the sex business industry is to achieve such a physical image of real women (only with porn star ratios) as technology permits.
Their creators want them to appear to be people on a stomach to copy the movements of the human body.
But that's exactly what robots are not like real women.
They cannot break up with or withdraw from their partners.
They don't have their lives or their biography -- nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, these are beautiful rabbis.
Or, as they said in 2017, they're servants.
L.A. Yugin (Puh) Jetter, who has been in charge of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on 31 August.
In an interview to the BBasket portal, the general manager, Andrey Lebedev, reported on this.
We tried to agree with Getter, but unfortunately he won't come on family occasions.
We're going to Eurobasket without a naturalized player because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with the direct participation of Jetter, the Ukrainian assembly took the sixth place in Eurobasket-2013 and first hit the world champion on a basketball at which the “silto-gray” could not overcome the group phase, and the U.S. citizen recruited an average of 15.4 points for the game, made 3 picks and gave 5 gears.
Jeter has ceased to advocate Ukraine's assembly since the resignation of the main coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left the post in 2015.
The male Eurobasket-2017 will take place simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its group tournament on Earth.
The Trustee of Eugenia Murzin will have five teams in Group B: Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3th), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our male assembly conducted two control teams, with Dutch and Belarusians relinquished.
A great tramp contest?
To make Mita Romney look very reasonable.
In the Trimpa era, the fact that the polarized American electricality has broken some families on a micro level was a common ground.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers held columns on how to deal with the horrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all strained so we're going to go.
They're talking less about the ability of Trump to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, my left-handed poetry from Chicago, who had been on the knife with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
In the Trampe in the White House, all she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she had disputed over the policy for decades, were suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This is certainly good at dinner; but I cannot help but think that in a broader context it may be dangerous.
The trump inhaled the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about the Tempa and the "normalization", we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we're not going to be struck by his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which the Trump “normalizes” of the rightmost Republicans, which will suddenly appear to be a model of sound meaning in the background of its standards.
I've caught myself in my misery today of Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness -- with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent-percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax declaration looks like) -- compared to the Trump and that, and the other one seems to be a very small evil.
When the Trump goes away, the next republican candidate will just be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with our kids to a carousel in the Central Park -- the largest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't want caffeine.
The horses are horrible and huge, the pictures of glasswalk on the central drum are screwed clowns and animals, who are terrified and terrified to look at their backs, are extremely ominous, and the sounding music is fascinating.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointing: the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings have come too far to cause a tremble, and the reality of the city hasn't been a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried the day I learned that Suiss-cottage is actually not a Swiss shale (the "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" thematic pub), but a big round crossing in North London.
And the carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two, a child of eleven, and two women in forty can have a great time.
If I could have given the carousels an assessment, I would have put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to do that.
And in the umbrella this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" shopping from one to five stars before I run a terminal card.
In the caffeine corner of my street, it's the same thing as accompanying the tea valuation in 15 percent is for orders from the rack.
As a result, not only has neutral interaction slowed down, but it also has to take personal interest in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor seller in the umbrella was smiling confusedly while I was tired of evaluating my experience in handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of his chest pain.
Pistorius leaves prison because of his visit to a doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of cuts on wrists, which the prison administration claimed he received as a result of his fall in the cell.
The Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after an appeal by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office for the initial sentence for unintentional murder.
He killed Stéencamp early in the morning of St. Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting several times at the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his friend to the night gate hidden from him in the toilet.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office announced the intention of protesting this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which she said was too soft.
The Office of the Attorney-General stated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be reviewed this year.
Pretorius may be 15 years old if the Public Prosecutor's Office succeeds.
In South Africa, there is no death penalty.
NTW journalist suspected of being beaten was selected a subscription on non-departure
Citizens of the police elected a non-departure subscription measure for a man who attacked NTW journalist Nikit Raspjaev during a direct air from the Gorky Park on 2 August.
This is reported by the TACS with reference to the official representative of the IMD RF Irena Wolf.
“In the investigation of a criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Criminal Code, the 32-year-old man who hit the person of a correspondent of a telecanal in the Central Cultural Park and the rest of the name of the Hornky, the suspect has been selected as a deterrent in the form of a subscription on non-departure and proper conduct”, Wolf clarified.
The representative of the Ministry added that an administrative protocol for police disobedience had been drawn up for the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct air of the BDA Day, an inevitable man approached the correspondent and hit the person.
As it later turned out, the bulligan has nothing to do with the VAT.
According to the Orozjaev himself, on the contrary, the dissenters tried to arrest the mosquito.
Two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal parking.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people who placed tents in an improper place, including two Bulgarian citizens, was detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the consequence is still being done.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the Bi-Ti-Vi television that the Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the control of a free camping and have already imposed serious fines on all who are caught during a parking place in a place not intended to do so.
The inspections will take place throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The Russian Ministry accused the U.S. vice president of the cold war rhetoric.
Statements made during the European tour by U.S. Vice-President Michael Pens were criticized by the Russian MiDA.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly leaning towards the primitive ideological stamps of the cold war, which are totally cut off from reality,” says a statement by the Russian foreign policy department.
So in the M.D., they responded to Pens' words about "Russian Threat" and to the violent crossing of the borders they said in Podgorica.
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed to the destructiveness of the choice of “or with the West, or with Russia” and the uncertainty of the alleged non-alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to detach Kosov from Serbia and thus created another hotel of tension.
“We call on American colleagues to stop the sewing of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is consistently based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,” says the Russian MIDA statement.
Feldsher suffered an accident with a "speed" in Submoskje.
The accident occurred in a mosquito Stupino, as a result of the collision of an idle caret with the Aid Rapid.
Today, about 08:10 ms occurred a clash of the Mitsubishi car with an ambulance car in the city of Stupino of Moscow.
“As a result of the collision, the “speed” machine turned over”, declared the TASA at the MAG press office in Moscow.
There are law enforcement officers at the site, and the circumstances of the incident are clarified.
In the Odessa region, the woman dumped her newborn son in a celephane package.
On the evening of 3 August, a local resident received a report to the Police Section of Selynia that he had found a package with a baby in an underbuilt private house.
“On the scene of the accident, the law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly delivered the child to the health facility”, reported in the Odessa Head of the National Police.
The medical authorities have determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical pulmonary.
The identity of a child is identified as a 36-year-old local resident during the first operational and investigation activities.
It has also been established that a woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the view of law enforcement agents, the family had never been registered before and had not been recorded.
Currently, the police have established the circumstances and reasons that have forced the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
In Nikolai, a 21-year-old woman reportedly dumped her undernourished child into garbage.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, but 55 is not 30."
One of the most successful artists of the Russian ester, Gregory Leps, will celebrate his 55th anniversary next Sunday.
Before the celebrity, the singer had contacted the observant.
I remember what your colonel said.
Gloria Gainor sings a special jacket for the nominee, a powerful salute over Moscow River.
You must have pretended to be holding your next five-year-old.
Did the intentions come true?
If you're talking about a profession, it was a good period.
I've worked a lot, three times I've been out with the toast all over the country, and I've had 120 to 130 concerts a year.
I released two nice albums.
Of course, I'm not the one I'm now, like, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks don't lie.
Singing as I sang at 30 is getting harder.
Still, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're recording the new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious?" on the one-named song that's written together with Timaty.
She's not quite ready, so we haven't put it anywhere.
Let's do it later when we get a video on it.
And the album will be presented in November for a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Your new plate was handed by a class American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to get him into your combustion?
I think Coleman is one of the world's most famous drummers today.
He was coming to my studio, recording his parties.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (known drummer participating in various projects. "Envestia") offered.
But for lengthy work in Russia, they were gently prone to conditions.
It was about fees from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought I would find decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer named Max Mallashev.
It is better to feed your own.
At times, I want to get in touch with some of them, not for what.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is high at the international level.
Western music magazines and various guitar festivals are being invited to write about it.
Steve Wai, after listening to his game, said, "the new generation of guitarists has come with another executive technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I've been telling you that I'm in there.
The more you talk to real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not stupid, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always been able to accomplish.
They sought the highest level of quality.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has given me ten years of entry.
But I'm going to submit visa documents to the British Embassy every year to allow me to go there again and the most important thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is favourable to me.
And in August, you're going to have a concert in Monaco, not ordered, but an office, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there once.
Now we are invited again, and as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert are dispersed.
At the Laima Whitewa, which will start on July 20th in Jurmale, will you?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lyme is a beautiful singer and a beautiful woman who can offer herself and a beautiful fiction, and even a whisper.
After the fairies and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to Vladimir Highsky's creativity.
Two albums with his songs you already have in discography.
When is the third one coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be completely different.
I want to write about 80 to 90 songs of High Sosek about the same feed as he did.
Only voice and guitar.
No other announcement.
Accompanying me will be our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to engage in the album and Alexander Jacoblević Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what's going on.
You and Boris Grebenщикov songs gradually entered your repertoire.
And then you can write down the album of his stuff.
Boris Borisović is a great man and a great musician.
I crossed with him several times and asked him, "Can I sing a song or something?"
He said, "Grigory, I write songs for them to do."
Please try, sing.
It's probably interesting to record that album.
As long as I don't have that kind of task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisović does not object, I may do that.
If you don't focus completely on the business of your producer center.
I suppose until you realized his potential, you didn't sign contracts with all the artists you wanted?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they're independent people.
You mean Sergei Lazarus?
Sergei is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Panayots, whom I led in the Holocaust.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It would be a pity if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm taking the clips off.
I hope there's a good outcome.
And I'm also trying to move other artists in my center: buying them songs, weeping poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the radio and television rotations.
If they do not reach high altitudes, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a recorded album on the way out, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they return the money they invested in them.
Although I'll be happy if one of them has a commercial success and pays me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I don't want to overwhelm the oxygen.
Let everyone work, punch, prove how I used to prove.
If tomorrow you're invited to make a tour in Ukraine and guarantee that you enter the country, will you leave?
I'm still being invited.
These are mainly closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, I believe, flying to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that I have to go to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll run.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I sincerely regret that this has been the case with Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least soon.
I used to give 40 to 50 concerts in Ukraine a year ago.
We met nowhere.
A very thankful audience.
And with a few Ukrainian artists, Ani Lorak, Light Lobodoy, Artem Loic...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and heartfeltly regret that they are now unable to make their talents fully available to the wider Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I'd love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, like Vladou Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely for the moment...
Andrea Olopkova was thrown out of the cosmodrom
As “U” became known, the technical director of East Andrew Olopkov began his work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCHP) on behalf of Khrunicev.
He had previously been de facto in the construction of East space, but because of disagreements with the leadership of the Centre for Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENCI) had been transferred to an enterprise in Moscow Phila, which was responsible for coordinating production.
Mr. Olopkov will not have a changer: a technical director would likely be abolished and a function dispersed by CENCI units.
That the Technical Director of the Eastern and Deputy Director of CENCI for Technology Development, Andrey Ollockkov, moved to Hrunijev's HNPC, U.S. told top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a government staff member.
"He's been working for a new post for a few weeks," he said to the business interlocutors.
CENCI ' s operational comment failed on Thursday, and Mr. Oluckk himself was not available for comments.
However, the U.S. information was officially confirmed in HKNP.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, stated to the enterprise. - Andrey Ollockkov ' s mission to provide a minimum launch for the first launch on the East launch was fully met.
Mr. Olopkov moved to work at CENCI in 2013, having a field service behind his shoulders in space troops, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk, the first commander of the Colonel was in the “very” space.
In 2009, Andrey Olopkov became a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional commerce had received the State ' s deposits but had failed to fulfil the commitments made to clean off separate parts of missiles in the Arcangel region and the Republic of Coma.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development in CENCI were extended to various projects, but mainly to the construction of space in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Restepenko, in an interview, said directly that the situation in the East had been “critical already in October 2013”.
The case is that a strategic error was made in the planning process: the completion of the construction and the first start of the Soyz-2 2 missile was planned for the same time, the end of 2015.
In order to implement the launch until the end of the year, the construction had been completed for six months earlier and had been postponed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, it had to be cunning: CENCI experts had begun to build parallel technology equipment in under-developed facilities.
Andrey Olekkov was the main supporter of this idea.
Despite the risks that existed and the shipment (only on December 2015, “Soise”, only departed on 28 April 2016), this idea was justified, says the source of the U.S. on the cosmodome, “On the other hand, we would still have not carried out a single start from the East but would have done the construction”.
The vice-premier Dmitry Rogozin, the cosmodroma manager, jested to call Andrea Olopkova his "Cosmic Susanien" but he's almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
I remember Mr. Bolkov and the instinct: for example, in an interview with the U.S., he proposed depriving the Federal Special Construction Agency (Spestrode) the status of the sole east performer and directly working with subcontractors, "Why do we have to put all eggs in one Special Building basket?"
That idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the General Contractor to complete construction and maintenance work on the launch and technical complex by the fourth quarter.
According to the “U” data, Mr. Olokkov's transition to a new place of work was a controversy with the CENCI leadership on how to complete the construction of space facilities and complexes, as well as how to work with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be best for all,” says one of the top managers involved in the raising of the East.
A government staff member, in turn, calls the decision strange: “He was one of the best professionals, it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement.”
According to the “U” data, this would not be necessary: the post of technical director of space would be abolished and its functions would be dispersed by CENCI units.
There will be a two-school curriculum in music schools
In the future, pupils in children's music schools will be able to receive two classes at the same time.
According to the Minister of Science and Education of the Minsk Culture, students can re-examine the recurrent disciplines, and the question of paying the rest of the studies in the second speciality, with special grants, is referred to by the “RIA Newsty”.
“The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we are working with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will allow two specialities to be learned, but at the same time will not be inconsistent with existing legislation in the field of education,” said Blueenko.
Last Friday Vladimir Putin, a student of Syríus child centre, said that she had to pay recurrent items in the second speciality at the MCS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she was studying violin and piano class and had the awards of both competitions.
The Head of State recognized its issue as very relevant and promised to assist.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russians were detained on the wall
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Cyril N., who was detained on the wall of a high building, reported the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital city of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-metre fence into the Nestle office building complex and took himself into one of his towers.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
We got a young man on the roof.
The Ministry of Public Security staff dropped him on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out whether a young man is legally located in the country.
In the meantime, videos with a young man at a height have become popular in the Network.
Users called the young man spider.
According to the media, such experiments are hobbies for him.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can help to facilitate ADC.
Red meat and chocolate are commonly considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests that diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammable intestine disease.
This incurable disease, which suffers from about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, leads to culprits and abdomen, chronic or bloody powder, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
For symptom mitigation, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at Washington University found that the main amino acid protein triptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the intestine.
Dr. Marco Colonna, a leading researcher, explained that immune cells in the intestines are watching to prevent harmful microbes from entering the body.
Cells capable of starting the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance by protecting the body without causing damage to sensitive tissues.
If the equilibrium is too severely disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it may lead to inflammatory intestine diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice with a certain bacteria in their intestines have increased tolerance of the cell.
And this bacteria needs triptophan -- one of the building elements of the protein -- to start these cells appearing.
Professor Colonna said, "We've established a link between one species of bacteria, Lactobaciillus reuteri, which is part of the normal microbiome of the intestine, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more a triptophane was kept in the feeding of mice, the more those immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same work would be done with people: a combination of L. reuteri and a rich triptophan diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less incitement in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Servantez-Barraganvas, studying the variety of more tolerant immune cells, found that one group of petty mice had these cells, and another group that belonged to the same line but contained separately did not have them.
She suggested that the difference might be caused by mice intestine microbioms, bacteria, viruses and fungus, which usually live in a stomach-inch.
The DNA of the intestine cells of mice was sevenated, and six species of bacteria present in mice with immune cells but missing from mice without them.
The mice, vegetated in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and their immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have raised L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then carried small portions of liquid, without bacteria, to underdeveloped immune cells from mice.
Immune cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a by-product of triptophane processing known as indol-3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophanes in the food of mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophane was doubled, the number of cells also fell twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that people have the same elevated tolerance of the cell as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our stomach-cheating tract.
Whether by-products of triptophane L reuteri contribute to the development of cells in humans as well as in mice, but people with inflammatory intestine diseases have detected defects in triptofan-related genes.
She says, "Perhaps the development of these cells should be strengthened, because these cells depend on inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines.
High levels of triptophane, if L. reuteri is available, may potentially lead to an increase in their population.”
According to José Mourinue, Manchester United hired “geny” in the face of Nemani Matić
Manchester Unated hired “genia” in the face of Nemani Matic, considers José Moureinue after a semi-defense debuted in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, acquired for £40 million at Chelsea, began with a 2-1 winning in Dublin at the last pre-sessional game entitled "Unated" before the Supercube UEFA match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made a impression as a semi-defensor, while players like Poggba and Andreas Perira burst forward when they wanted to.
However, since Matich did not participate in the Chelsea Pre-session Tour on Asia, he was seriously lacking preparations for the game, and he endured only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinue, required further development before the beginning of the Prime League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in the way he thinks, he thinks soccer,” said Mourinue.
“We will help him prepare sooner than it is late.”
Like Matich, his new players Victor Lindelef and Romelo Lucak began playing the Aviv Stadium, when Morinius began forming his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Indonesian newspaper reported this week that Moriny wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire.
"I am grateful to the club for earning three out of four," he added.

Former leaders of the social democrats of Lithuania encourage them to remain in the ruling coalition.
The former Presidents of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Party, the former Prime Ministers Algirdas Butkjavićus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Simeon Speaker of the Social Democrats of Cheslovas Jurchnas, appealed to the same parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported in the Paris newspaper, friction with partners, the Union of Peasants and Greens, has initiated a discussion in the Social Democratic Republic of the Party as to whether the ruling coalition should remain.
There are three senior pilot associates who have addressed an open letter from the parties, which states, inter alia, that “the disappointment of party partners is clear, but the coalition with the “Crestians” has created for us not very easy conditions, but the conditions for the further realization of the objectives of social justice, which, on our initiative, are envisaged by the Government's programme, and for the continuation of the political dominance of the left centre over the right parties”.
In the view of the party ' s former leaders, in the discussion, “the emotion-based expression of opinion has so far prevailed without specific arguments”.
The authors fear that their party can lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability by unreasonable actions.
Disabled Anton Mamaev was fined.
The Moshordos had reduced the punishment of an invalid wheelchair to Anton Mamaev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 roubles.
Previously, the judgement of the Timirenjayev court was released from the IML.
At the same time, Mosgorud confirmed that the accused was a criminal, since he had organized a robbery and abduction of a motorologist at the former SSV.
The Moshord's decision reduced Anton Mamayev's sentence to a fine of 200,000 roubs.
“Mamaeus is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the composition of the crime, and accordingly the person must be prosecuted”, explained the “U” by the Spokesman of Mosgordo Ulyan Solobova.
In this case, the Court took into account Mamajev ' s health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied article 64 of the Criminal Code, according to which the penalty could be imposed below the lower limit.
With regard to Assistant Mamajev Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of gravity and a change in the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself stated that he was displeased with the Mosgorous Court decision.
I'm disappointed by a court decision.
The only legitimate solution would be justification and will continue to fight for justice.
His counsel, Andrey Orlov, did not exclude the appeal against the sentence before the Court of Cassation of Mosgorud and the Supreme Court.
"We'll use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he said, "RIA Newsty."
Remember, the 28-year-old Moscow of Anton Mamayev, suffering from a back muscle atrophy, became a criminal case last autumn.
The disabled claim that they bought a motorler from acquaintances for 160,000 roubles to sell.
However, Motoroler owners, among whom the former fighter of the spontaneous, stated that the disabled and his assistant Vasili Serostanov had taken away their property, threatening to use violence.
On 30 June, the Timirenjazev District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasili Serostanova to three years of colony and Anton Mamajeva to four and a half years of imprisonment serving sentences in a general regime colony (art. 162, para.
After a disabled person was placed in the SIDS, the Public Chamber, the Human Rights Commissioner of President Tatiana Moscalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from SIZO by a decision of the same Timirenjaze Court.
The defence, in turn, appealed to the first instance ' s decision in Moscow.
UNF will prepare an environmental report to the President
The General Russian People ' s Front (OPF) outcome will be devoted to environmental issues in 2017, reported to “Investigators” as a source in the SPF and confirmed by the head of the Alexei Anisimov Compliance.
He said that, as a result of the Frentics Forum, it was planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental problems and to propose a strategy for their solution.
Interviewers at the SPF noted that the report of the Head of State would contain “deep analysis” in the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to ODA, the outcome forum of the DF will be held in autumn.
Its exact date is not yet defined, as a rule, under the President ' s schedule, which is the leader of the movement and has traditionally been present at the key activities of the DF.
The Frente held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts, in Rostove Na Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan Oude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward at these events, we will also formulate systemic proposals to address environmental problems, and the interviewer to the SPF “Investigates”.
The Co-Chair of the Olga Timophoeva Central headquarters, chairing the Committee of the State of Environmental Affairs, reported that the “Frontitis” would report to the Head of State on the work of the Year of the Environment in Russia.
The Concluding Environment Forum and the Forum of Action of ONF are likely to be reconciled.
In a year, we have developed a powerful team of experts on environmental issues, have seen gaps in legislation, have stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we prepare for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the “Frenchers” will report on the work on the priority projects of the DF, as told by Olga Timothyev to “Ivestions”.
She said that a special representative of the Head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergey Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the work of Mediaforum ONF, which had been held in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go back to history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms for them to work for years.
To avoid falling out of the agenda, Olga Timothywa added.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Studies (EISI), Andrey Colladin, noted that by raising the environmental problem, the DF operates in line with the presidential agenda.
Many of the things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, said to "Investigators" Andrey Colladin.
He stressed that to date the economic potential of the environmental agenda could not be excluded, which could provide additional impetus for development to the regions.
The expert added that, in the future, through ONF, the regions would be able to promote not only the solution of their environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism.
The reality of the environmental theme demonstrated the direct line with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the basin dump in Balachya (hereinafter closed) and the coal dust at the port of the city of Nayakka (hereinafter drafted a bill banning the open transfusion of coal in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timothyva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for addressing environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been established, the question is further enforcement, as well as in civil society positions.
Leonid Bochin, head of the Charitable Fund “Ecology for All”, needs a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State.
A member of the HRT, Head of the Greenpeace Russia NGO Sergei Chickenkov, in his conversation with “Investings” stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is needed in order to successfully address environmental problems, some legislative efforts are scarce.
As soon as society and business realize that addressing environmental problems is a much more beneficial step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change,” said Sergei Cyplekov.
The expert stressed the need to reverse the tendency that a violation of environmental legislation was a cost-effective solution for the business.
British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and car by the sweep of his hand.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip set up so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office, and even run the car with a simple blow of his hand.
Steven Northam, 30, has used a tiny chip between his big fingers and his fingers, and now through his BioTek firm, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives by means of technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthetic consultant from the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the use is conducted in accordance with medical standards.
Technologies are similar to the microchip that cats and dogs use, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam's company also replaces locks in houses and cars with chip-compliant at 300 pounds per castle.
A married father of one child has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
The White House Requisition went to taxpayers in thousands of dollars.
According to the records of the armed forces provided by the magazine TIME, the decision of the White House last month to hijack a seafood helicopter on the South Lawn for an event dedicated to the American Industrial Production costed taxpayers $44,000.
The Sikorsky Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, became a central element of the events held in the White House on 17 July, where American construction programmes were demonstrated.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pens and senior officials of the White House inspected technological products from all fifty states.
A helicopter in Connecticut was placed next to a boat from Man, a firewall from Wisconsin and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Escadrille of Maritime Infantry Helicopters (HMX-1), the Helicopter Administration of the White House military ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or FRAGO, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the South Lawn on the occasion of an “uncommon” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you are aware, because this is an unusually extensive press event”, wrote the commander of HMX-1 in an e-mail to his chief, the first Deputy Aviation Chief of the Sea Infant Corps, on the day before.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event designated for 3 hours of day and remain there before the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required to reflew the flight in accordance with hours of work limit.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the security personnel of the unit remained close to the aircraft while they were on the ground.
The records received by TIME left unclear whether the second crew was eventually required.
The Hetch Act prohibits federal employees from using State property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the activity was inconsistent with the decision.
“We asked, among other things, if it was a violation of Hatcha's law, and we were told that it was not,” wrote the commander.
“It is like you have nowhere to go,” replied the Deputy Chief.
The event “Done in America” was declared White House as an official event, and Hatcha's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the reform of health at the time in the Senate and commended efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But it's not unusual to ask for them in the interest of photography.
The trump had already been discussed in February, when the presidential plane travelled backwards during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential plane.
“The white house is thrilled with the show “Delivered in America”, which presents products from 50 states made by American American workers from American materials,” said Lindsey Walters, Deputy Spokesman of the White House.
The HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington agglomeration and in the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to the White House with a precision to a inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the event “Done in America” was shut down to the crew for the necessary training flights per month.
The unit ' s helicopters also flyed 11 additional hours on that day as part of the “non-President support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not liable for any of the other exhibits represented at the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company had not participated in a helicopter demonstration in the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not account for presidential flights, and determine the exact amount spent on the event is difficult.
But according to the Interim Fiscal Cost of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the reimbursement rate for the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit ' s records indicate that the aircraft was 30 minutes in air each side of its airfield based on the Kuantico Marine Infantry base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“Assessing the cost of taxpayers, based on an approximate rate of reimbursement, is totally incorrect,” said Walters.
“These exemplary rates include the composition, services and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual appropriations”.
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the REND corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but indeed take into account the cost of fuel, services and expenses specified in the treaty.
At that time, former Speaker, Speaker, Spokeser, Speaker, of the White House, spoke in favour of the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea of showing things made in America this week,” said Spyser.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands of people, whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, which so much Americans were working on.
It is, of course, advisable to bring this to the attention.”
It was unclear whether the Trump had been interacting with the helicopter, looking at the southern grasshopper during the event, but he was definitely sitting in the driver's place in a fire car.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed the representatives of Sikorsky to the press on the subject of his own fleet of the products of the company.
"I know Sikorsky well," said the president. "I have three of them."
Moscow will provide grants for the city hospital intensive units
Annual grants of life will be allocated to reactions and intensive therapy of capital clinics.
Funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobian, visited the Urban Clinic Hospital of Judas.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thankful letter to the traumatic doctor Victor Protzko, led by the most difficult operation to rebuild the teenage foot.
Sergei Sobian also described the decision to allocate annually intensive therapy to urban grenade clinics.
Funds will be directed to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the capital citymaster, the Judas Clinic Hospital to date is one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, new modern equipment has been sent to the clinic to allow doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 at the Kolomen Rural Hospital.
Currently, medical offices are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive and stationary, there are day-to-day offices.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical establishment became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term stations (SPCs).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
Best medical equipment is used in surgical interventions to reduce significantly the duration of the rehabilitation of patients.
After operation, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year only, 36,000 patients were hospitalized at the Judaina Clinical Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 1,5800 operations in various degrees of complexity.
NBO reported a lack of Ukrainian daughter buyers of Sberbanka

This is reported on Friday, 4 August by the TACS, with reference to the NBO press representative.
The NBO confirms that on 3 August 2017, the package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopeni, to harmonize the purchase of 100 per cent of the Sberbank shares was withdrawn.

Said Guzeriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guzerieva, was the consortium master of the consortium.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of the five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
In the course of the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favour of parental organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depended on the role of women in politics, stated in the United Nations.
The elections could be representative only when all members of society, including women, spoke on Wednesday to the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women vote for provincial council elections, three women fight for Vice-Presidentship, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Choices can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
The elections to the provincial council and the election of the President will take place in Afghanistan on 5 April.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and producers of Burity
For decades, the efforts of the Soviet and Post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buratiya (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electric energy consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since 1 September, the value of electricity in low voltage for industrial recipients has decreased by 25 per cent.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation on the Change of the Regulations on the Bulk of Electric Energy and Power and the Consolidated Electrical Energy (Energy) Production and Potential Production (Strength) in the Russian Federation's Uniform Energy System (17.07.2017 No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Burity.
As a result, the cost of electrical energy for burial producers is reduced by a quarter, making life easier for small, medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the Republic have cheated the poрогs of Moscow ' s cabinets in futile attempts to balance the region in tariffs with the neighbouring Irkuts region with the hazard of hydroelectric power plants in Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main watershed territory for which is Buratiya.
Only this year did the moves begin.
In March, electrical energy tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roub./kWh to 3.93 roub./kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the incorporation of Buratia by the Federal Government's decision to the List of Territories of the Optical Market Price Zones, for which the performance of the whole and retail markets has been characterized by more than industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the people of the Irkuts region pay for Kilowatt/hour 1.01 roubles.
But no one dares to describe at least the near date of the new tariff movements towards the deterioration of Buratia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiling Workers (GMB) is concerned at the investment of McVitie's in Glasgo
Trade unions require guarantees from the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's for his long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
The GMB Scotland office reports that the future investment of the Torkros facility was silent.
More than 500 people work in a factory producing Hobnobs and Rich Tea, among other products.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, reports that over the past few years, I have invested more than £5 million.
The company adds that, in the event of any change in the site, staff members and trade union representatives will “know first”.
In a letter to the leader of the company, the Scottish GMB office demanded McVitie's reactions to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drue Duffy stated: “The members of our trade union are deeply concerned that we cannot obtain clarity from the head of the business and investment facility on the future of Tolcross.”
Families have been working here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the Great Glasgow territory; it is the most important pillar of decent work on high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the context of Breqzit, the growth of the living minimum and the chronic decline in production, East End Glasgo desperately needs to be prosperous in McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The leader of the Torkros facility just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with trade union staff and representatives”.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with the staff and representatives of the GMB, at which a number of issues were openly discussed.
We talked to the staff that, like all companies working in a competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions — and this concerns all our facilities and activities — in order to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tokros facility, especially in production lines and improved functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a productive facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at the site, staff and trade union representatives will learn first.”
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosenifti and Gasproma
Vladimir Putin stated that the issue of the supply of gas to the East Petroleum Company (FNAC) should be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one would give the directives of Gasproma as well as “Rosnefti”.
Thus, President Vladimir Putin of Russia responded to Igor Secin’s request to help resolve the disputes that arose.
The Head of State noted that the relationship between “Rosneft” and “Gazprom” should be decided solely on the basis of market principles.
Previously, Igor Secin, Head of Rosnefti, at a meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, reported that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for HNCC puts the project in jeopardy.
Sachin noted that the dialogue with the Gazprom on this issue was continuing.
The Gasprom proposes to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosnephthy, but we don't have such resources," added Secin.
Remember that Rosnife asked her to use gas for the East Petrochemical Company from the Kirin Land of Gasproma on the Sahaline Shelf.
In June, Gasprom stated that negotiations on this issue continued and “no corners there are”.
Has the SPW warned Barcelona of Neimir's transition three years ago?
The La League member may regret his interest in Marko Verratti
Pari Saint-German will not stop pursuing Neimar after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the three-year-old world record?
The sensational proposal renewed the summer transfer window when the League Club 1 was ready to beat the world record at the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark of the return of Pogba to Manchester United in the last season of 89 million pounds.
When the transition is completed, Naymar will be the world's most expensive player, as well as the world's most highly paid professional athlete, as SPW offers him a salary of over 500,000 pounds a week.
It is known that Barcelona and the anger of the proposal were expressed, and how Naymar broke the contract, despite the fact that a source close to the leadership of the Catalan Club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But has the soccer world been warned of such a possibility three years ago by the President of the SPL?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in the hiring of Blaise Matuide in 2014, Nasser Al-Halaifi issued a severe warning to every club that would like to lure one of the best players in the SPG.
“I don't worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going to oppose them, we're going to make the offers to their players,” said Al-Halaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences."
Barcelona appears to have crossed that line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in Marco Verratti's semi-professionalist from the SPW.
The SPW has made it clear that it will not let the Italian player collect under any conditions, and it is now likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of his proposal as the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neyamara.
