But first of all, I think we need to add to the component of unity.
I think we have problems with that.

China is strongly opposed to the adoption by the United States of the Taibay Bill.
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Taibay Bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of the three Chinese-American joint communiqués.
This was stated on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the Gossovette CPD for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguan.

China must and will be reunited.
This historic trend cannot be stopped by no means by any force, and Ma Xiaoguan has emphasized.
TikTok hides unpleasant videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom under the age of 18
Imagine China / Reuters
TikTok, a Chinese social network, censores videos that refer to Tibet’s area of Tiananmen, independence or the banned Falunguin religious group, reports The Guardian.
The papers in the publication explain that the owner of TikTok (byteDance) by means of the annex advances Chinese foreign policy objectives abroad.
The main part of China ' s policy violations is “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok puts unpleasant publications in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the activities of the social network do not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of the socialist system of China falls under the general prohibition of “critical or attacking any country's policies and social rules, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”.
The prohibition on the mention of incidents on the Tinyanmen Square or on the genocide in Cambodia falls under “the distortion of the history of China or other countries”.
The document also lists the banned names of 20 “foreign leaders or public officials”, including Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sena and Kim Jin Yin, the Indian policy of Mahatma Gandi, the American Presidents Donald Tramp and Barak Obama, the Japanese Prime Minister Sinzo Abe, the South Korean President, Park Kin Hy, Indonesian President Joko Vidododo and the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as set out in the document.
The forbidden material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications from the first category are removed by social network administrators and may lead to user blocking.
Not too severe violations fall into the second category: such publications remain on the website, but are limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer apply: “Now we use a localized approach for modernization, and we're attracting independent local professionals”.
The Russian users of TikTok do not have specific restrictions on publications, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Produser Center.
The "Produser Center" is one Russian media company that officially collaborates with TikTok.
All the ads of the Bloggers of the "Produser Center" agree with the social media, but user materials can be posted without agreement, transfers the Bogdans.
To the question of whether TikTok can speak about policy or Putin, Bogdanov answers in a positive way and says that he has seen such publications.
The founder of Our Didgital Roman Zaryp's agency agrees with Bogdan: "The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in a user agreement: you can't put down a shocking content, discriminating statements, and so forth."
But these rules can be subtracted from any content that does not like moderns, notes Zaripes.
The Agency is another Russian partner, TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40 per cent of whom are under the age of 18.
According to a user agreement, only persons over 13 years of age can use TikTok.
Society administrators test their age with artificial intelligence: neurosite analyses persons and determines how many years a person looks, tells Bogdans.
If the neuroscience decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to the RBC, ByteDance opened the office in Moscow in September 2019 on the territory of the WeWork Corporation.

Russians warned of bank counterfeiting calls.
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudulents has increased to replace the bank’s phone number.
This is reported by Commersantier with reference to the Central Bank data.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided communication operators with information on more than 2.5,000 numbers called by clients from different financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators found a substitution.
Another 218 numbers have been blocked and 59 have set a limitation on the use of financial services.
The Deputy Head of the Information Security Department of the CB, Artem Sichev, said that a number had been replaced by a wide range of Russian banks.
He explained that the operators did not always respond to fraudulent phone warnings by referring to the absence of such a responsibility in the Law on Communication.
At the Opening Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank confirmed an increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a sub-number.
As reported in the Biljan Press Service, part of the information on fraudulent calls transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the lists contained numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with clients.
Their blocking would lead to disruptions in the work of the organization.
Artem Sitchev reported that Central Bank planned to establish a database of fraud numbers to which the communications operator would apply on each call to verify the number.
He explained that the establishment of such a framework would require amendments to the law.

Barcelona blackmails Neimar
The Spanish Barcelona and her ex-footballer, Brazilian Naymar, are trying to settle the financial dispute that arose after the attacker came into French St. Jerman.
The case had almost reached the court, but the Catalonians had invited the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of the Femida.
Otherwise they deny him.
Nymar and his cunning father, who is also a Brazilian agent, were intriguing: by agreement with Barsa, which the player signed in 2016, he had to get Euro40 million.
However, literally a year later, the forward was in the SPL for the record Euro222 million.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million catalonians and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Badly, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When it became known about Neimir's claims in the capital city of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue Grenade insists that the Bonus was relied on the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player had only a quarter of Euro40 million and required the return of the proportional part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that the summer of Naymar and Barsa almost agreed to return the "poor" player to Catalonia.
True, the deal broke down, but the hope of the reverse transition of the forward remains.
As reported by Sports.Ru, with reference to insiders, the club lawyers stated to the player that if the issue of financial claims was not settled pre-trially, it would exclude the possibility of returning the Brazilian person.
Naymar himself wants to go back so much that he asked the catalonians to buy him back.

Mass riots for three
The "Moskov case" against the participants in the summer protests is more markedly dispersed into fragments and losing political fulfillment.
The evidence of “mass riots” itself does not hold the tests, but, in the absence of a political decision to dismantle the case at the brakes, a weak evidentiary base would not necessarily result in the removal of the charges.
The breakdown of the case must encourage society, but it is certain that the forcewomen whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have proved to be in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining accused under article 212 of the Criminal Code (Masc disorders), Alexey Minyalo, was suddenly released out of custody without obligation and was rehabilitated in a few hours later: the SBR withdrew his charges.

The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has drafted amendments to the Police Act to protect the police detainees from spreading defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, a application for public discussion of the bill had been made on the federal portal, and the draft document had not yet been published.

Will phytoastrogens and phytoandrogens be able to extend youth?
The subject of phytoandrogens has been studied weakly.
One of the most famous is the pine dust.
The phytoestrogens, however, are not badly researched and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (such as cardiovascular, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogen are all beans (the most popular is soy), hmel, lean seed.
However, many experts believe that such BADs cannot be a complete substitute for natural hormones.
There can be no possible harm from such additives.
For example, in the background of their admission, the production of their own hormones may be reduced by too much analogies outside the body.

The Hydrometcenter called the right people's adjectives
In Russia, there are many popular opinions on which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometcentre, we checked all the appliances that were supposed to work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, yes, in a short time frame.
According to the science director of the Russian Hydrometcenter, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will really be nice, as our ancestors have noted.
And if the sky lights are white, then the next day will be rain.
The second adjective is based on bird surveillance.
They're often talking about laziness, if they're flying low, it's usually raining.

Unidentified oil spots have been detected on the beaches of northeastern Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin were found on 99 beaches north-east of Brazil.
The pollutants were scattered two thousand kilometres [2,000 km] of the coastline.
Reports of the first oil spots detected began on the second September.
However, their number, like territorial coverage, continued to increase every day until Thursday.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples identified.
It turns out that they are all the same and that they are the same as crude oil.
In the State Petrobras Oil Corporation, which was transferred to an analysis by the samples found, it was stated that they did not correspond to oil extracted from the Brazilian territory.
"It's a thick oil.
It can be dumped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely it was in the oceans”, told the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the Pernambuku Oil Industry Trade Union and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continued to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmental defenders have discovered nine sea turtles, full of oil films.
And only two of them were saved.
In the near future, the Brazilian Environment Institute, together with Petrobras, will proceed to clean up contaminated beaches.
In the meantime, the Institute recommends that tourists and local residents cross the oil spots by the party and alert all the detected pits of pollution.
Medvedev has been asked to reconsider the standards of the company ' s businesses
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev commissioned Rosmodenador, Minusta, Mineconomics and Minprommer, together with business ombudsman and the business community, to reconsider sanitary and epidemiological rules and norms for the civic organizations.
They will also have to consider the transition to nutritional requirements set out by the Eurasian Economic Union.
The agency ' s proposals should be submitted to the Government no later than 15 October, as described in the list of Mr. Medvedev ' s commissions as a result of the 11 September Dialoge programme on the “Russia 24” television.
By the same time, Mr. Medvedev had mandated all the agencies in addition to the Minusta to submit proposals for a test on the limitation of controls for the general-purpose organizations in a number of regions, including Moscow, Tatarstan and Kaliningrad.
The Ministry and the Ministry of Economics are mandated until 11 November to submit to the Government a bill amending the MAPA on the application of administrative suspension for the violation of nutritional requirements, which has resulted in health damage.
In addition, Minforce, Mineconomics, Rossemoro and Minfina need to work on a gradual transition from 2021 to the development of a consumer basket based on a basic set of products that provide a healthy diet.

The Russians have nothing to put back on retirement.
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentine Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have sufficient savings to make the country fully secured a pension product bill.
The practice of increasing pensions from personal accumulation in the world is quite widespread.
Another matter is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"In my view, a large proportion of the population now have incomes, of which they simply have nothing to devote to increasing pensions in the future," said V. Mattvienko.
In the opinion of the Speaker, the Russians could not understand the mechanisms for the formation and accrual of pensions, since “permanent changes in this area have completely confused them”.
This does not mean that I oppose the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
“The Russian Federation is a social State, and we are obliged to do everything to improve the social security of citizens for pensions.
But the steps in this direction must be thoughtful, responsible, accountable to the domestic realities,” said V. Mattvienko, “RIA Newsty”.
The Head of the SF stressed that if the initiative (the law on a secured pension product) was to be developed, several basic principles, including voluntaryity, tax preferences for citizens and employers, and stringent guarantees and State responsibility for securing pension savings, must be established.
On 6 September, the Ministry of Finance announced that a bill on a guaranteed pension product (GPP) should be submitted to the agreement.
Among its main elements is the exclusively voluntary order of citizens ' accession to the accumulation system, the safeguarding of long-term pension accumulations by the State, the registration of citizens' accumulations by the central administrator, tax benefits for the business and tax deductions for citizens.

President Marvel Studios Kevin Faigi said he was excited.
It's fascinating that the trip to Marvel's cinema will continue.
"We're all at Marvel Studios very happy to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a symbolic figure.
It's a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," says his press release.
And Faigi reminds me that Sony also creates his own spider-man movie, built up just around the Spider-Man.
"So it happened that he was the only superpowered hero who was in the movies.
So while Sony continues to develop his own Universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five movies, apparently commenting the news, put in his record at Instagram an excerpt from the Wall Street film, where Leonardo de Caprio's hero shouts, "I don't go!"
Information on the differences between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half of the cash release from spider films provided that both companies would pay half the cost of producing paintings.
But Sony didn't do that.
The news of the possible departure of a favorite superhero from Marvel's cinema has caused anger on many loyal worshipers.
The details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said, “We have cooperated perfectly for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue to work together was commensurate with the wishes of many fans [Malian Speaker].
We are glad we can go forward together."

The expert told me why you should give up your tea in the packets.
A group of scientists from Canada representing the University of McGill found that more than ten billion particles of tea in a five-minute cup are produced when a packet of tea is constructed.
A packed drink may also include particles of opium, said Nation News, an expert on food security, Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to an agronom, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of a packed tea-producer may add ingredients that will not be indicated in the package.
Oils are not thrown out at the end of the season, so they can get in tea.
"More than that, the packets don't always include tea plants," said Tychonova.
She said that it would be better not to use such a drink for tea for entertainment, which was sold at specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the risk of packed tea is not only in its composition but also in its production - micro particles are heating up to high temperatures, which could cause them to start extracting harmful substances.
"The best way to acquire a clean green tea or a black tea is to be less than addiction in such a drink," said the expert.

As the “Parliamentary newspaper” was known, on 27 September, the Chairman of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy, Andrew Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Maxim Oreshkin, and the Minister of Finance, Anton Silvanov, proposing to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation ' s constituent to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized entrepreneurship (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation for Economic Policy has compiled regional information on the business development and legalization of self-employed and the outcomes of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the development problems of SMEs and forwarded proposals to improve existing legislation.
“To date, the communication between the regions is not sufficient, as a result of which the business community in all regions has identified the lack of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes across the country”, said Andrey Kutepov.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of regional positive developments on the legalization of self-employment and consolidated data from the regions with proposals and issues (to be drafted).
In addition to the specialized ministries, the regional consolidated data are also provided to regional executive heads.
The exchange of information on well-implemented work in the regions could lead to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such exchange and the provision of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” said the Parliamentary newspaper, Senator.

In the view of the regional authorities, a number of changes should be made to existing legislation in order to support small and medium-sized business more effectively.

In the Ivan area, it is considered necessary to amend the expansion of the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities related to the segregation and renovation of accommodations, buildings and physical training.

Standby shipments to Russia fell 100 times.
In the Government of the RF, it has been estimated that the supply of agricultural and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo has decreased more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31,000 tons of products were imported from sanctions countries in the first half of 2019, against 3 million 442.2,000 tons during the same period 2013, reports Interfax.
At the same time, the value of imported products fell to $226.5 million from $4 billion,975.5 million, respectively.
This is the supply of goods that have not been embargoed.
As indicated in the report, the amounts of illicit imports were offset by increased imports from CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that, at the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural production, raw materials and food, which were prohibited from entering Russia through counter-sanctions.
In a document posted on the official legal information portal, it was noted that the rule was extended for another one for a year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The original effect of the sanction destruction order was applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Subsequently, since 13 August 2015, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, as of 1 January 2016, joined the list.
The decree signed by Putin to destroy the illegal entry into the country of “sanctions” (products under the food embargo, which Moscow introduced in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West), entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has permitted the destruction of “sanctioned” food in any legitimate way.
As western sanctions continue, the RF has also extended its responses.
However, the measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption with a weight of up to 5 kilograms.
However, Mikhail Fedotov, President of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights, had previously referred to the “simply immoral” destruction of foodstuffs, and he said that it had a negative effect on the upbringing of people.
Moreover, in early June, Rospeedozor had taken the initiative to prohibit the destruction of food suitable for use.
Thereafter, a similar recommendation was made to the Government by the Human Rights Council of the President of the RF.
And the vice-premier RF Alexei Gordeev said it's wrong to destroy food, and we should think about how to use it as a destination to evaluate the quality.

In Chile, we started building a telescope of Euro1 billion
This is reported by the TACS with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
According to ESO, this week the building was officially built, where the E-ELT telescope would be located, while the most expensive and ambitious land astronomy project was located.
Its total value is estimated to exceed the billion euros.
Most of these money will be spent on the construction of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex part of the telescope is its record-big mirror, with a diameter of about 30 feet.
It will be collected from 798 six-angular segments of 1.4 metres.
This huge mirror, as well as two supporting reflecting surfaces of 4.2 and 375 meters, will help E-ELT to get the first detailed photographs of planets outside the Solar System, the stars in other galaxies, and to find Earth's doubles.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to monitor the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome has only begun, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory are developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years since the first plans for the construction of E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose aggregate value was Euro400 million, was received by the German firm SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
